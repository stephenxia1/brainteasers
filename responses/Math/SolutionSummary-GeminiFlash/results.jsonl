{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.

Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.

The wedding date is determined by the day the last unique route is traveled. The longest route length is calculated using the geometry of the island and a specific identified path.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n**Part 1: Wedding Dates**\n\n1.  **Identify the travel destinations:** The three sons travel from their village (let's call it A) to the first three villages clockwise (B, C, and D), which are an adjacent village (B), the second village along the coast (C), and the opposite village (D).\n2.  **Determine the valid travel paths:** The sons can only travel along straight paths connecting villages or visiting intermediate crossings, with the constraint that they must *always* be getting closer to their final destination village.\n3.  **Count the number of valid routes for each destination:** Using a method that involves identifying all possible nodes (villages and crossings) and counting paths by moving step-by-step from the start village to the destination village, ensuring each step moves closer to the destination and summing the counts of paths leading to intermediate nodes. The solution calculates the number of valid routes:\n    *   From A to B (adjacent village): 5 routes.\n    *   From A to C (second village): 41 routes.\n    *   From A to D (opposite village): 121 routes.\n4.  **Determine the last travel day:** Each route corresponds to a day of travel, starting on April 1st. The total number of valid routes equals the total number of trips the son must make. The last trip occurs on the day number corresponding to the total number of routes.\n    *   For 5 routes, the last trip is on the 5th day (April 1st + 4 days = April 5th).\n    *   For 41 routes, the last trip is on the 41st day (April 1st + 40 days = May 11th, as April has 30 days).\n    *   For 121 routes, the last trip is on the 121st day (April 1st + 120 days = July 30th, counting 30 days in April, 31 in May, 30 in June, and 29 into July).\n5.  **Determine the wedding dates:** The wedding takes place on the day *following* the last trip.\n    *   After the last trip on April 5th, the wedding is on April 6th.\n    *   After the last trip on May 11th, the wedding is on May 12th.\n    *   After the last trip on July 30th, the wedding is on July 31st. (Note: The provided solution states August 1st for the last wedding date, which suggests a potential one-day discrepancy in the problem's date counting or the solution's calculation). Based on the calculation above, the dates are April 6th, May 12th, and July 31st. *Following the provided solution's dates*, the weddings are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\n\n**Part 2: Bonus Question (Longest Route Length)**\n\n1.  **Identify the geometry:** The island is a circle with a 10-mile circumference and 6 evenly spaced villages forming a regular hexagon inscribed within the circle. The radius (r) of the circle (and the length of a hexagon side between adjacent villages) is Circumference / (2 * Pi) = 10 / (2 * Pi) = 5/Pi miles.\n2.  **Identify the longest route:** The solution identifies a specific path from village A to village D (the opposite village) as one of the longest valid routes, for example, the path A to B to ABi to C to Ci to CDi to Di to D (where ABi, Ci, CDi, Di are intermediate crossings).\n3.  **Break down the longest route into segments:** This specific path is broken down into segments: A-B, B-ABi, ABi-C, C-Ci, Ci-CDi, CDi-Di, and Di-D.\n4.  **Determine the length of each segment:** Using the geometry of the hexagon and the implied structure of the interior crossings, the segments are assigned lengths relative to the radius:\n    *   A-B is a hexagon side: length = r = 5/Pi.\n    *   C-Ci and Di-D are segments on paths towards the center or opposite village: length = r/2 = (5/Pi)/2.\n    *   The remaining four segments (B-ABi, ABi-C, Ci-CDi, CDi-Di) are determined to have lengths equal to the side of smaller internal equilateral triangles, which is r/sqrt(3) = (5/Pi)/sqrt(3).\n5.  **Calculate the total length:** Sum the lengths of the segments: (A-B) + (B-ABi) + (ABi-C) + (C-Ci) + (Ci-CDi) + (CDi-Di) + (Di-D) = r + r/sqrt(3) + r/sqrt(3) + r/2 + r/sqrt(3) + r/sqrt(3) + r/2 = r + r + 4*(r/sqrt(3)) = 2r + 4r/sqrt(3).\n6.  **Substitute the value of r and calculate:** Plug in r = 5/Pi: 2*(5/Pi) + 4*(5/Pi)/sqrt(3) = 10/Pi + 20/(Pi*sqrt(3)).\n7.  **Compute the numerical value:** Calculate 10/Pi + 20/(Pi*sqrt(3)) which is approximately 3.183 + 3.676 = 6.859 miles.\n8.  **State the longest route length:** The longest route length is approximately 6.86 miles.", "Status": true}

Let it have k digits. Let the first digit be d (where d is an integer from 1 to 9). The number can be written as N = d * 10^(k-1) + R, where R is the number formed by the remaining k-1 digits.\n\n2.  **Represent the Rotated Number:** Rotating N to the left means taking the first digit 'd' and moving it to the end. The resulting number, N_rotated, is formed by taking R and appending 'd' as the last digit. This can be written as N_rotated = R * 10 + d.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equation:** The problem states that the rotated number is exactly 1.5 times the original number: N_rotated = 1.5 * N. Substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into this equation: R * 10 + d = 1.5 * (d * 10^(k-1) + R).\n\n4.  **Solve the Equation for R:** Expand and rearrange the equation to express R in terms of d and k:\n    *   10R + d = 1.5 * d * 10^(k-1) + 1.5R\n    *   10R - 1.5R = 1.5 * d * 10^(k-1) - d\n    *   8.5R = d * (1.5 * 10^(k-1) - 1)\n    *   Multiply by 2 to get integer coefficients: 17R = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)\n    *   R = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2) / 17\n\n5.  **Relate N back to d and k:** Substitute the expression for R back into the original equation for N (N = d * 10^(k-1) + R):\n    *   N = d * 10^(k-1) + d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2) / 17\n    *   Combine the terms by finding a common denominator: N = d * [17 * 10^(k-1) + (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)] / 17\n    *   Simplify: N = d * [20 * 10^(k-1) - 2] / 17\n    *   Factor out 2: N = 2 * d * [10 * 10^(k-1) - 1] / 17\n    *   N = 2 * d * (10^k - 1) / 17\n\n6.  **Identify the Condition for N to be an Integer:** For N to be an integer, since 17 is a prime number and does not divide 2 or any single digit d (from 1 to 9), the number 17 must divide the term (10^k - 1).

The notation `.2` represents the decimal number 0.2.\n3.  **Understand the exponent:** The exponent `^(-2)` means raising the base (0.2) to the power of -2. A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent, so `(0.2)^(-2)` is equivalent to `1 / (0.2)^2`.\n4.  **Calculate the square of 0.2:** `(0.2)^2` means 0.2 multiplied by 0.2, which equals 0.04.\n5.  **Calculate the reciprocal:** Now we need to calculate `1 / 0.04`.

Analyze the sum of the six numbers formed by rotating and swapping the digits of the original 6-digit number. Observe that each column in the summation contains all six distinct digits of the number. This means the sum of the digits in each column is equal to the digital sum of the original number.\n2.  Recognize that if the digital sum is represented as a two-digit number `XY`, the sum of the six configurations will have a structure related to summing `XXXXXX` and `YYYYYY`. The condition that the first and last digits of this total sum match the digits X and Y (in some order) implies that the sum of X and Y must be less than 10 (i.e., X + Y < 10), preventing a carry-over to the leftmost column from the second column.\n3.  Determine the possible values for the digital sum (`XY`). It must be between the minimum (0+1+2+3+4+5=15) and maximum (9+8+7+6+5+4=39) possible digital sums for a 6-digit number with distinct digits. Furthermore, the digital sum `XY` must be a prime number in this range and its digits X and Y must satisfy the condition X + Y < 10 (from Step 2). Identify the prime numbers between 15 and 39 (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37) and filter them based on X + Y < 10 (eliminating 19, 29, 37). This leaves 17, 23, and 31 as possible digital sums.\n4.  Use the clue that the digital sum (`XY`) matches the number formed by the last two digits of the number. So the last two digits must be 17, 23, or 31. Also use the clue that the sum of the first two digits equals the sum of the last two digits (which is X + Y from the digital sum `XY`). Test the possible last two digits (17, 23, 31) against the remaining conditions:\n    *   If the last two digits are 31 (digital sum 31, X+Y=4), the first two digits must sum to 4. The only remaining digits that sum to 4 are 0 and 4. Neither 04 nor 40 is a two-digit prime, eliminating 31.\n    *   If the last two digits are 17 (digital sum 17, X+Y=8), the first two digits must sum to 8. Possible remaining digit pairs summing to 8 are (0,8), (2,6), (3,5). Only 53 is a prime number formed by these pairs. If the first two digits are 53 and last two are 17, the sum of these four digits is 5+3+1+7=16. Since the total digital sum must be 17, the middle two digits must sum to 1. The only pair of distinct digits summing to 1 is 0 and 1, but 1 is already used. This eliminates 17.\n    *   If the last two digits are 23 (digital sum 23, X+Y=5), the first two digits must sum to 5. Possible remaining digit pairs summing to 5 are (0,5), (1,4). Only 41 is a prime number formed by these pairs (05 is not a 6-digit number start). This confirms the digital sum is 23, the last two digits are 23, and the first two digits are 41.\n5.  Determine the middle two digits. The total digital sum is 23. The sum of the first two digits (4+1=5) and the last two digits (2+3=5) is 10. Therefore, the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - 10 = 13. Identify the remaining available digits and the pairs that sum to 13: (5,8) and (6,7).\n6.  Apply the condition that the numbers formed by the digit pairs must be prime. The pairs (5,8) form 58 or 85 (neither prime). The pair (6,7) forms 67 (prime) or 76 (not prime). This confirms the middle two digits are 67.\n7.  Assemble the number using the identified digit pairs: first two are 41, middle two are 67, last two are 23. The number is 416723.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Solution: 2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.

That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.

From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.

The property is a similar regular polygon circumscribed around a larger circle. The distance from the foundation edge to the property edge is equal to the foundation diameter, meaning the radius of the circle circumscribing the property is three times the radius of the circle inscribing the house (the foundation). The pipe length, which bisects the area of the house polygon from edge to edge, is equal to the length of one side of the property polygon.\n2.  **Recognize the Constraint on the Number of Sides:** The core challenge is finding the number of sides ('n') of the regular polygons. The fact that a line segment (the pipe) equal to the property's side length *also* bisects the area of the house polygon provides a crucial constraint. For a given number of sides 'n', there is a range of possible lengths for area-bisecting chords within the inscribed house polygon. The property side length must fall within this range when scaled correctly based on the radius relationship (property radius = 3 * house radius).\n3.  **Find the Number of Sides (n):** By setting up an inequality using the geometric relationships from steps 1 and 2, expressing the property's side length and the house polygon's bisector lengths in terms of 'n' and the radii, it is determined that only one integer value for 'n' satisfies the condition. The calculation shows that n must be 10. Rex knew this information was sufficient because 'n' could be uniquely determined.\n4.  **Calculate the Actual Side Length:** Ralph fenced 400 feet. Since the property is a 10-sided polygon (decagon) and one side is the gate (made of the pipe), the fence covers the remaining 9 sides. Therefore, the length of one side of the property (and the pipe) is 400 feet / 9 sides.\n5.  **Determine House Dimensions:** Using the actual side length of the property (from step 4) and the fact that it's a decagon (n=10) circumscribed around a circle, the radius of that circle can be calculated. The radius of the house foundation (the circle inscribing the house decagon) is one-third of this value (from step 1). With the house's radius and n=10, the apothem and side length of the house decagon can be calculated using standard regular polygon formulas.\n6.  **Calculate the House Polygon Area:** The area of the 10-sided house polygon (decagon) is calculated using its apothem and side length (or radius), for instance, by summing the areas of the 10 triangles formed by connecting vertices to the center.\n7.  **Calculate the Atrium Area:** The atrium's diameter is one-tenth of the property's longest measurement. The property's longest measurement is the diameter of the circle it is circumscribed around. Calculate this diameter (twice the property's circumscribing circle's radius). The atrium radius is one-tenth of this value divided by 2. Calculate the area of the circular atrium using its radius.\n8.  **Calculate Total Square Footage:** The usable area on each floor is the area of the house polygon (step 6) minus the area of the atrium (step 7). Since the house has two stories, the total square footage is this usable area per floor multiplied by 2. This final calculation results in 2730 square feet.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.\"\n\"The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.

This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.

The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.

We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "SUMMARY:\n\nThe problem involves four mathematicians and two secret integers greater than 1. Brahma whispers the sum (S) to Sachin and the product (P) to Prashant. The numbers are deduced through a sequence of logical steps based on their conversation.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the solution process:\n\n1.  **Initial Information:** Brahma chooses two integers (X and Y), both greater than 1. Sachin knows S = X + Y, and Prashant knows P = X * Y. Nakul knows neither but hears the conversation.\n\n2.  **Sachin's First Deduction:** Sachin states that he is sure that neither he nor Prashant knows the numbers *at this point*. Knowing the sum S, Sachin considers all possible pairs of integers (a, b) > 1 such that a + b = S. For each such pair, the product would be a*b. If *any* of these products a*b were such that only one pair (a,b) yields that product (e.g., if a and b were prime), then Prashant would know the numbers immediately from the product. Sachin's statement implies that for *every* pair (a, b) summing to S, the product a*b must have *multiple* factor pairs (c, d > 1) whose sums (c+d) are *also* plausible initial sums (sums for which Sachin could make his first statement). The provided solution simplifies this: Sachin's confidence implies that the sum S *cannot* be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Let's call this property \"Property S1\".\n\n3.  **Prashant's Deduction:** Prashant, knowing P and having heard Sachin's statement (thus knowing the true sum S must have Property S1), states that he *now* knows the numbers. This means that among all pairs of integers (c, d) > 1 whose product is P, exactly *one* pair (x, y) has a sum (x+y) that satisfies Property S1 (i.e., is on the \"Possible Sum List\" derived from Step 2). This uniqueness allows Prashant to identify the correct pair (x, y) from the product P. Let's call this property \"Property P1\" for the product P.\n\n4.  **Sachin's Second Deduction:** Sachin, knowing S and having heard Prashant's statement (thus knowing the true product P must have Property P1), states that he *now* also knows the numbers. This means that among all the pairs of integers (a, b) > 1 that sum to S, exactly *one* pair (x, y) has a product (x*y) that satisfies Property P1 (the product property from Step 3). Sachin can find this unique pair (x, y) by checking which of the products resulting from pairs summing to S is the one that would have allowed Prashant to deduce the numbers.\n\n5.  **Nakul's Deduction:** Nakul hears the entire conversation and understands the logical sequence of deductions made by Sachin and Prashant based on Properties S1 and P1. By following the same logic, he can also uniquely identify the pair of numbers.\n\n6.  **Finding the Numbers:** The solution demonstrates that the unique pair of integers greater than 1 that satisfies all these conditions is (4, 13).\n    *   Their sum is 17, which satisfies Property S1 (17 is not the sum of two primes, allowing Sachin's first statement).\n    *   Their product is 52. The pairs >1 multiplying to 52 are (2, 26) and (4, 13). 2+26=28, and 28 can be written as 5+23 (sum of two primes), so 28 does *not* satisfy Property S1. 4+13=17, which *does* satisfy Property S1. Since only (4,13) among the factor pairs of 52 has a sum satisfying Property S1, the product 52 satisfies Property P1, allowing Prashant to deduce the numbers.\n    *   Sachin, knowing S=17, considers pairs (a,b) summing to 17: (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10), (8,9). Their products are 30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72. By checking which of these products satisfies Property P1 (Prashant's unique identification), Sachin finds that only the product 52 does (as shown above). Since S=17 leads to P=52 uniquely satisfying Property P1, Sachin knows the numbers must be the pair summing to 17 that yields a product of 52, which is (4, 13).\n\nThus, the numbers are 4 and 13, deduced through the specific logical properties implied by each step of the conversation.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?\n Solution: First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

Define the variables: Let L be the length of the train, V be the speed of the train, and v be the walking speed of Al and Ben.\n2.  Recognize that Al walks 30 feet *away* from the train's direction in the time it takes the train's back to pass him. Ben walks 45 feet *in the same direction* as the train in the time it takes the train's back to pass him.\n3.  Formulate equations based on relative speed and time. When Al walks away, the relative speed of the train's back approaching him is V + v. The time Al walks is 30/v. The distance the train's back covers relative to Al is L. So, L = (V + v) * (30/v). When Ben walks in the same direction, the relative speed of the train's back approaching him is V - v. The time Ben walks is 45/v. The distance the train's back covers relative to Ben is L. So, L = (V - v) * (45/v).\n4.  Equate the two expressions for L: (V + v) * (30/v) = (V - v) * (45/v). Simplify this equation by multiplying by v and dividing by 15: 2(V + v) = 3(V - v).\n5.  Solve the simplified equation for the relationship between V and v: 2V + 2v = 3V - 3v. This gives V = 5v, meaning the train is 5 times faster than Al and Ben. This matches the conclusion in the provided solution.\n6.  Consider Al's motion again. Al walks 30 feet. The time he walks is t = 30/v. In this same time t, the front of the train (which started at the same point as Al) travels a distance D = V * t.\n7.  Substitute the relationship V = 5v and the time t = 30/v into the distance formula for the train: D = (5v) * (30/v) = 5 * 30 = 150 feet. This means the front of the train has moved 150 feet from the starting point by the time Al stops.\n8.  Visualize the situation when Al stops: Al is 30 feet from the starting point (walking away from the train's initial direction), and the back of the train is exactly where Al is. The front of the train is 150 feet from the starting point. The length of the train (L) is the distance between its front and its back.\n9.  Since the front of the train is 150 feet from the start, and the back of the train is at Al's position (-30 feet from the start in the opposite direction, or 30 feet from the start in Al's walking direction), the length of the train is the distance the front moved plus the distance Al moved: L = 150 feet + 30 feet.\n10. Calculate the train's length: L = 150 + 30 = 180 feet. This matches the final calculation in the provided solution.", "Status": true}

The following is the conversation we had.\n\"How old are you Tammy?\"\n\"I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.

This gives the relationship: `z = x + y`.\n\n2.  **Derive Equations from Clues:**\n    *   The clue about Mum turning 50 states that when Mum is 50, Tony's age will be `x`.\n    *   The number of years until Mum turns 50 is `50 - Mum_now`.\n    *   Tony's age then will be `Tony_now + (50 - Mum_now)`.\n    *   We know `Tony_now = Mum_now - z`. Substituting this gives Tony's future age as `(Mum_now - z) + (50 - Mum_now) = 50 - z`.\n    *   Setting this equal to `x` (from the clue) gives the equation: `50 - z = x`, or `x + z = 50`.\n    *   Combine this with the relationship `z = x + y` (or `x = z - y`) from Step 1. Substituting `x = z - y` into `x + z = 50` gives `(z - y) + z = 50`, which simplifies to `2z - y = 50`, or `2z = 50 + y`.\n\n3.  **Find Possible Ages when Tony was Born:**\n    *   From the clue about when Tony was born, Mum's age was `z`, and Tommy's age was `y`.\n    *   Also, `y` must be a factor of `z` (since Tommy's age was a factor of Mum's age).\n    *   We use the equation `2z = 50 + y` and the condition that `y` is a factor of `z` to find possible pairs of `(z, y)`. Testing possible values, the only integer solutions where `y` is a positive factor of `z` are `(z=26, y=2)` and `(z=30, y=10)`.\n\n4.  **Use the \"Factors of Mum's Age\" Clue to Select the Correct Pair:**\n    *   The clue states that when Tony was born, the ages of Timmy, Tracey, Tommy, and Tammy were *all* factors of Mum's age (`z`). This was one of only two times when *more than two* children's ages were factors of Mum's age.\n    *   In case 1: `z=26` (Mum was 26), `y=2` (Tommy was 2). The factors of 26 less than 2 are just 1. The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey must be distinct factors of 26 less than Tommy's age (2), which is impossible as only age 1 fits, and they need three distinct ages.\n    *   In case 2: `z=30` (Mum was 30), `y=10` (Tommy was 10). The factors of 30 less than 10 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}. We need three distinct ages for Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey from this set such that Timmy > Tammy > Tracey, which is possible (e.g., 6, 5, 3). This case fits the criteria of having four children's ages (10, plus three from {1,2,3,5,6}) being factors of Mum's age (30).\n    *   Therefore, Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born (`z=30`, `y=10`). The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey when Tony was born must be three distinct numbers from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} in decreasing order.\n\n5.  **Use Tammy's Current Age Clue to Determine Timmy's Age When Tony was Born:**\n    *   Tammy's current age is three times Timmy's age when Tony was born.\n    *   The possible ages for Timmy when Tony was born are the largest of the possible sets of three distinct ages from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} ordered decreasingly. Possible Timmy ages are 6, 5, or 3.\n    *   This means Tammy's current age must be 3 * 6 = 18, 3 * 5 = 15, or 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n6.  **Use the \"Second Special Year\" Clue to Find Tammy's Current Age:**\n    *   The other year where more than two children's ages were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as Tammy is *now*.\n    *   Test the possible current ages for Tammy from Step 5:\n        *   If Tammy is 15 or 9, Tracey's age in the second year would be 7.5 or 4.5 respectively, which are not whole years. This is impossible.\n        *   If Tammy is 18, Tracey's age in the second year was 18 / 2 = 9. This is a whole year, so this is the correct age.\n    *   Therefore, Tammy's current age is 18.\n\n7.  **Determine All Ages When Tony was Born:**\n    *   Since Tammy's current age is 18, and her age is 3 * (Timmy's age when Tony was born), Timmy's age when Tony was born must have been 18 / 3 = 6.\n    *   We know Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born. Timmy was 6.\n    *   The ages of Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey when Tony was born were distinct factors of 30 from {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} in decreasing order (Timmy > Tammy > Tracey). Since Timmy was 6, the only remaining factors are {1, 2, 3, 5}. The only distinct pair from this set less than 6, in decreasing order for Tammy and Tracey (Tammy > Tracey), is 5 and 3.\n    *   So, when Tony was born: Mum=30, Tommy=10, Timmy=6, Tammy=5, Tracey=3, Tony=0. (Verify order: 10 > 6 > 5 > 3 > 0. Correct for Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony).\n\n8.  **Calculate Current Ages:**\n    *   Tammy was 5 when Tony was born and is 18 now. The time elapsed since Tony was born is 18 - 5 = 13 years.\n    *   Add 13 years to everyone's age when Tony was born to find their current ages:\n        *   Tony: 0 + 13 = 13\n        *   Tracey: 3 + 13 = 16\n        *   Tammy: 5 + 13 = 18\n        *   Timmy: 6 + 13 = 19\n        *   Tommy: 10 + 13 = 23\n        *   Mum: 30 + 13 = 43\n\n9.  **Verify with the \"Second Special Year\" Clue:**\n    *   The second special year is when Tracey was 9. Since Tracey was 3 when Tony was born, this was 9 - 3 = 6 years after Tony was born.\n    *   In that year (6 years after Tony was born): Mum was 30+6=36. The children's ages were Tony=0+6=6, Tracey=3+6=9, Tammy=5+6=11, Timmy=6+6=12, Tommy=10+6=16.\n    *   Mum's age was 36. The children's ages were {6, 9, 11, 12, 16}. The factors of 36 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}.\n    *   Children's ages that are factors of 36: 6 (Tony), 9 (Tracey), 12 (Timmy). This is 3 ages, which is \"more than two\". This confirms the ages and the timing of the second special year fit the clue.\n\n10. **State the Final Ages:** The calculated current ages are: Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13, and Mum is 43.", "Status": true}
