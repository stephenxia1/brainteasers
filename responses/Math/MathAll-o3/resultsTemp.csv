0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the six coastal villages ​0,1,2,3,4,5​ in clockwise order around the circular island.  
Assume the three brothers all live in village 0 and wish to marry girls who live in the next three villages encountered clockwise – i.e. in villages 1, 2 and 3.

For every pair of villages there is a straight jungle path, so the graph of the routes is the complete graph K₆ drawn on the six vertices of a regular hexagon.  
For a given destination D we call the (straight–line) Euclidean distance from a village V to D the “level” of V with respect to D.  
A suitor is allowed to move only along an edge that leads to a strictly lower level, so every admissible route is a strictly descending chain of levels; consequently no route can revisit a village and the directed graph is acyclic.

-------------------------------------------------
Counting the admissible routes

1.  Destination 1  (bride in village 1)

Levels with respect to 1  
distance 0 : {1}  
distance 1 : {0,2}  
distance √3 : {3,5}  
distance 2 : {4}

The suitor starts at village 0 (level 1).  
The only adjoining vertex of lower level is the destination itself, so there is exactly

 N₀→₁ = 1  route : 0 → 1.

2.  Destination 2  (bride in village 2)

Levels with respect to 2  
distance 0 : {2}  
distance 1 : {1,3}  
distance √3 : {0,4}  
distance 2 : {5}

From 0 (level √3) one may go to 1, 3 or 2.  
Continuing from 1 or 3 one can only go on to 2.  
Thus

 N₀→₂ = 0→2 , 0→1→2 , 0→3→2  = 3 routes.

3.  Destination 3  (bride in village 3)

Levels with respect to 3  
distance 0 : {3}  
distance 1 : {2,4}  
distance √3 : {1,5}  
distance 2 : {0}

Work upward from the destination:

P(3)=1.  
P(2)=P(4)=1 (they can only go directly to 3).  
P(1)=P(5)=P(2)+P(4)+P(3)=3.  
Finally

 N₀→₃ = P(1)+P(5)+P(2)+P(4)+P(3)=3+3+1+1+1=9 routes.

-------------------------------------------------
Wedding dates

Each suitor makes one trip per day, starting April 1, and marries the day after his last trip.

• Bride in village 1 : 1 route → finished April 1 → wedding April 2.  
• Bride in village 2 : 3 routes → finished April 3 → wedding April 4.  
• Bride in village 3 : 9 routes → finished April 9 → wedding April 10.

So the three wedding days are

 April 2, April 4, and April 10.

-------------------------------------------------
Bonus – length of the longest admissible route

Let the island’s circumference be 10 mi.  
Then the radius is R = (10 mi)/(2π) = 5/π mi.

Useful chord lengths (central angle θ):
θ = 60° → L₆₀ = 2R sin30° = R  
θ = 120° → L₁₂₀ = 2R sin60° = R√3  
θ = 180° → L₁₈₀ = 2R.

Among the nine admissible routes from 0 to 3 the longest are

 0 → 1 (L₆₀) 1 → 4 (L₁₈₀) 4 → 3 (L₆₀)

 0 → 5 (L₆₀) 5 → 2 (L₁₈₀) 2 → 3 (L₆₀)

Each has total length  
L₆₀ + L₁₈₀ + L₆₀ = R + 2R + R = 4R = 4·(5/π) = 20/π ≈ 6.37 miles.

-------------------------------------------------
Final answer:  
The weddings take place on April 2, April 4 and April 10.  
(The longest route any suitor must walk is 20 / π ≈ 6.37 miles.)",True
1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the sought-after number be  
N = d·10^{k−1} + r  

where  
• k = number of digits,  
• d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9) = first (left–most) digit,  
• r = remaining k−1 digits (0 ≤ r < 10^{k−1}).  

Left–rotating N moves d to the right end, giving  
N' = 10·r + d.

The condition is  
N' = 3/2 · N.

Substitute N and N':

10r + d = (3/2)(d·10^{k−1} + r)  
⇨ 20r + 2d = 3d·10^{k−1} + 3r  
⇨ 17r + 2d = 3d·10^{k−1}  
⇨ r = d(3·10^{k−1} − 2)/17.          (1)

Because r is an integer and d is not divisible by 17 (d ≤ 9), the factor  
3·10^{k−1} − 2 must be divisible by 17.

Thus we need k such that  
3·10^{k−1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).

Compute 10^{n} mod 17 (period 16):

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
10^{n} mod 17 : 1 10 15 14 4 6 9 5 16 7 2 3 13 11 8 12

Multiply each by 3 mod 17:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
3·10^{n} mod 17 : 3 13 11 8 12 1 10 15 14 4 6 9 5 16 7 2

We obtain 2 at n = 15, i.e. k–1 = 15 → k = 16.  
So the smallest possible number must have 16 digits.

Now compute r from (1) with k = 16:

r = d(3·10^{15} − 2)/17.

Take the smallest possible d = 1 (to minimise N):

3·10^{15} − 2 = 2,999,999,999,999,998  
Divide by 17:

r = 176,470,588,235,294.

Hence

N = d·10^{15} + r  
  = 1·10^{15} + 176,470,588,235,294  
  = 1,176,470,588,235,294.

Verification:

Left rotation: 176,470,588,235,294·10 + 1 = 1,764,705,882,352,941.  
1.5 · N = 3/2 · 1,176,470,588,235,294 = 1,764,705,882,352,941.

The condition holds, and no shorter number is possible.

5,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.

Ralph then asks, ""If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?""
Rex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, ""Very nice, Ralph!""
Rex then tells Ralph his number.
What did Rex say?
(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the six-digit number be

a+b+c+d = 18; a+b = f+2 ⇒ c+d = 16–f.
ef must be 23 or 29; hence f = 3 or 9.

•  f = 3   (ef = 23 prime)  
   a+b = 5.  The only way to get a two–digit prime ab with sum 5 is 41.  
   So a = 4, b = 1.  
   Then c+d = 16 – 3 = 13.  
   With unused digits the only pair summing to 13 that forms a prime is 67.  
   Thus c = 6, d = 7.  
   Number: 416 723.   All digits distinct; ab = 41, cd = 67, ef = 23 are prime.

•  f = 9   (ef = 29 prime)  
   a+b = 11.  Possible prime ab with distinct digits: 47 or 83.  
   Both force c+d = 7, which cannot be achieved with unused distinct digits
   that yield a prime cd.  No solution.

Hence the only candidate so far is 416 723.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Case e = 3
a+b+c+d = 27; a+b = f+3 ⇒ c+d = 24–f.  
ef must be 31 or 37 ⇒ f = 1 or 7.

• f = 1 ⇒ a+b = 4: gives no prime ab with distinct digits.  
• f = 7 ⇒ a+b = 10: only prime ab is 19, leaving c+d = 17, impossible
  without repeating 9.  No solution.

Thus the unique six–digit number satisfying the first three sets of clues is

N = 416 723.

The “rotation–sum” clue  
The six cyclic rotations of N are

416 723, 167 234, 672 341, 723 416, 234 167, 341 672.

Their sum is 2 555 553.  
Its first digit is 2 and its last digit is 3 – exactly the digits e and f (2 and 3) in some order, as required.

Final answer: 416723",True
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
7,Find the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed circles for a triangle.,Try to use the area of the triangle,"Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle. Let s be the semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2. Let A be the area of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the triangle have side-lengths  

 a = BC , b = CA , c = AB  

and denote  

 Δ = area of the triangle,  
 p = (a + b + c)/2  (the semiperimeter).

1.  Inradius r (radius of the inscribed circle)

   The circle that is tangent to all three sides has radius  

  r = Δ / p = 2Δ / (a + b + c).

   Proof outline  
   • The inscribed circle divides the triangle into three smaller triangles with common height r and bases a, b, c.  
   • The sum of their areas is therefore  
  (1/2) a r + (1/2) b r + (1/2) c r = r(a + b + c)/2 = r p.  
   • This must equal the whole area Δ, hence r p = Δ, giving r = Δ/p.

2.  Circumradius R (radius of the circumscribed circle)

   The circle that passes through the three vertices has radius  

  R = abc / (4Δ).

   Proof outline  
   • In any triangle,  Δ = (abc)/(4R).  
     This follows, for example, from the extended law of sines:  
  a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C = 2R.  
     Using A = angle opposite a etc., we have  
  Δ = (1/2) bc sin A, but sin A = a/(2R).  
     Substituting gives Δ = (1/2) bc · a/(2R) = abc/(4R).  
   • Hence R = abc/(4Δ).

Therefore, given the side lengths or area (by Heron’s formula Δ = √[p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c)]), one finds

 Inradius  r = 2Δ / (a + b + c),  
 Circumradius R = abc / (4Δ).

Final answer: r = 2Δ / (a + b + c) and R = abc / (4Δ), where Δ = √[p(p−a)(p−b)(p−c)], p = (a + b + c)/2.",True
8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N  = number of coconuts in the original pile  
a = 1st man’s private share

e = 5th man’s private share (taken during the night)  
k = each man’s share in the final morning division  

Translate the story into equations.

Night-time divisions  
1.  N = 5a + 1       (one extra coconut goes to the monkey)  
    After the first man leaves with a, 4a coconuts remain.

2.  4a = 5b + 1      (second man finds one extra, gives it away)  
    4b remain.

3.  4b = 5c + 1      (third man)  
    4c remain.

4.  4c = 5d + 1      (fourth man)  
    4d remain.

5.  4d = 5e + 1      (fifth man)  
    4e remain.

Morning division  
6.  4e = 5k          (now it divides evenly into five piles).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Force divisibilities from the last two equations
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (6) ⇒ 4e is a multiple of 5 ⇒ e ≡ 0 (mod 5).  
Write e = 5m.

Equation (5): 4d = 5e + 1 = 25m + 1  
⇒ d = (25m + 1)/4.  
For d to be an integer, 25m + 1 must be divisible by 4.  
Since 25 ≡ 1 (mod 4), 25m + 1 ≡ m + 1 (mod 4);  
therefore m + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ m ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Write m = 4n + 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Keep working backwards
--------------------------------------------------------------------
d = (25(4n + 3) + 1)/4 = (100n + 75 + 1)/4 = 25n + 19.

Equation (4): 4c = 5d + 1  
⇒ 4c = 5(25n + 19) + 1 = 125n + 96  
⇒ c = (125n + 96)/4.  

Because 125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), 125n + 96 ≡ n (mod 4).  
So n ≡ 0 (mod 4).  Write n = 4p.

Then c = (125·4p + 96)/4 = 125p + 24.

Equation (3): 4b = 5c + 1  
⇒ 4b = 5(125p + 24) + 1 = 625p + 121  
⇒ b = (625p + 121)/4.

Now 625 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so 625p + 121 ≡ p + 1 (mod 4).  
Thus p + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Write p = 4q + 3.

Then b = (625(4q + 3) + 121)/4  
      = (2500q + 1875 + 121)/4  
      = (2500q + 1996)/4  
      = 625q + 499.

Equation (2): 4a = 5b + 1  
⇒ 4a = 5(625q + 499) + 1 = 3125q + 2496  
⇒ a = (3125q + 2496)/4.

Because 3125 ≡ 1 (mod 4), 3125q + 2496 ≡ q (mod 4).  
Hence q ≡ 0 (mod 4).  Write q = 4r.

Then a = (3125·4r + 2496)/4  
      = (12500r + 2496)/4  
      = 3125r + 624.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Reconstruct the original pile
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (1): N = 5a + 1  
⇒ N = 5(3125r + 624) + 1  
⇒ N = 15625r + 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Least positive solution
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take the smallest non-negative integer r = 0.  
Then N = 3121.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Quick check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 3121:

• 1st man: 3121 = 5·624 + 1 → leaves 4·624 = 2496  
• 2nd man: 2496 = 5·499 + 1 → leaves 4·499 = 1996  
• 3rd man: 1996 = 5·399 + 1 → leaves 4·399 = 1596  
• 4th man: 1596 = 5·319 + 1 → leaves 4·319 = 1276  
• 5th man: 1276 = 5·255 + 1 → leaves 4·255 = 1020  
• Morning: 1020 = 5·204, no remainder.

Everything matches the story, so 3121 is indeed the smallest possible starting number.

12,"In ""4+4+4+4=1!"" it was shown that just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you can form all the numbers from 0 to 9 using exactly four 4's.
For example: 7 = 4 + 4 - 4/4
Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.
(An exponent is raising a number to the power of another number such as 4^4 = 256; a factorial is the product of all the integers from 1 to the integer such as 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24.)",The first number that can't be formed is 39.,"The first number that can't be formed is 39. This isn't proved, so maybe you can figure out how to form 39.

• Train (its back) moves forward with speed v: x_back(t) = –L + v t

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework","Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

Furthermore, from conditions 3 and 7 we know that CD is divisible by 4 and GH is divisible by 8 (because FGH is divisible by 8 and F is even). Because C and G are odd, D and H must be 2 and 6 in some order.
From conditions 2 and 5, we know that A+B+C, D+E+F, G+H+I are all divisible by 3.

     from {1,…,9} and F even.  
6.  Finally ABCDEFG must be a multiple of 7, and the whole number must of
    course use every digit 1,…,9 once.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – find the possible triples FGH

List all multiples of 8 between 200 and 900 whose digits are in {1,…,9}
and are all different:

216, 248, 264, 296,  
416, 432, 472, 496,  
624, 632, 648, 672,  
816, 824, 832, 864, 872, 896.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – use condition (★)

a)  F = 2                     ⇒  D ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 8.
    Then CD must be 28, 48, 68; each of these uses up the last even digit.
    No even digit is left for B, so F = 2 is impossible.

b)  F = 4                     ⇒  D ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 6 (D must be even).
    Keep only the FGH triples that start with 4 and avoid repeated digits:
        432, 472.
    (416 and 496 repeat the digit 6.)

c)  F = 6                     ⇒  D ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 8.
    With D = 8 the pair CD must be 28, 48 or 68, each using the last even
    digit, leaving none for B.  Hence F = 6 is impossible.

d)  F = 8                     ⇒  D ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ D = 2.
    But F = 8 already uses 8, and CD would have to end in …2, which is
    not divisible by 4.  So F = 8 is impossible.

The only viable case is therefore

  F = 4, D = 6, FGH = 432  or  472.

Step 3 – treat the two remaining sub-cases

I.   FGH = 432  ⇒ G = 3, H = 2.  
     Even digits used so far: 4,6,2.  
     The only even digit left for B is 8  ⇒ B = 8.

     With D = 6, the pair C6 must be 16, 36 or 96.
     (56 is forbidden – 5 is already used; 76 duplicates 7.)

     • C = 1 gives A = 9 (to make A+B+C ≡ 0 mod 3).
       The 7-digit prefix 9816543 is NOT divisible by 7.

     • C = 7 or 9 can be checked similarly; neither yields the 7-divisibility.
     Hence FGH = 432 is impossible.

II.  FGH = 472  ⇒ G = 7, H = 2.  
     Even digits used so far: 4,6,2.  
     The only unused even digit is 8  ⇒ B = 8.

     Now C6 must be 16, 36 or 96.

     • If C = 1 then A + 8 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 3)  ⇒ A ≡ 0 (mod 3).
       The unused digits are 3 and 9; choose A = 3 (or 9), I = 9 (or 3).

       Take A = 3, I = 9.  The complete number is
                3 8 1 6 5 4 7 2 9
       Check the remaining conditions:

       – 38 even ✔  
       – 381 divisible by 3 ✔  
       – 3816 ends in 16 ⇒ ÷4 ✔  
       – 38165 ends in 5 ✔  
       – 381654 even, digit-sum 27 ⇒ ÷6 ✔  
       – 3816547 ÷7 = 545221 ✔  
       – 38165472 ends in 472 ⇒ ÷8 ✔  
       – 381654729 digit-sum 45 ⇒ ÷9 ✔

       All conditions are satisfied.

     • C = 3 or 9 can be tested; neither gives the 7-divisibility.

Assume there is a real answer. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the radius of the hole (R). Use whatever value is easiest.","The volume is exactly 36Pi cm^3 (about 113.1 cm^3).
Hard solution:
The sphere's diameter (2r) must be the same as the length of the cylinder (H) plus the height of the two caps (2h), so 2r=H+2h.
Thus, 2h=2r-H and H=6, so 2h=2r-6 or simply h=r-3.
A right-angled triangle is formed by the radius of the cylinder (R) and half the height of the cylinder (H/2), with the radius of the sphere (r) forming the hypotenuse. Using Pythagoras: R^2+(H/2)^2=r^2.

Easy solution:
Assume the hole is infinitely small (i.e. a radius of 0). Then, the volume of the cylinder (and the volume of the caps) is 0. The height of the cap is 0, so the radius of the sphere (r) is 3cm (half of the length of the cylindrical hole). Thus:

[Order as a quadratic equation]
x^2 - 48x + 320 = 0

If the radius were 8, then that would mean the corner office would end up extending into the circular area (because the corner office is 16 x 8).

• The centre of the court is the centre of the square floor, i.e. (L/2 , L/2).

The point of the office that meets the court is its furthest corner (16, 8).  
Hence that point must lie on the circle:

The next time the man bought all four items together was on the following year’s Independence Day, July 4.  
Working in an ordinary (non-leap) year, count the days between those two dates.

From June 14 to Dec 31 of that year: 365 – 165 = 200 days  
( June 14 is the 165th day of a non-leap year.)  

From Jan 1 to July 4 of the next year: 185 days  

Total interval between the two “all-four-items” purchases  
= 200 + 185 = 385 days.

Thus 385 days is the least common multiple of the three purchase intervals
(pack of cigarettes, half-pint of cream, one-pound can of coffee).

Factor 385: 385 = 5 × 7 × 11.

Because the newspaper is bought every day, we need three different divisors of 385 for the other three items, with the constraint that

newspapers are bought most often  
→ cigarettes are bought next most often  
→ cream next  
→ coffee least often.

Hence the only possible assignment of the factors is

cigarettes every 5 days  
cream every  7 days  
coffee every 11 days.

A pack holds 20 cigarettes, so smoking the same amount each day and finishing a pack exactly every 5 days means

20 cigarettes ÷ 5 days = 4 cigarettes per day.

(Leap-day abstention does not affect this interval, because the 385-day span considered contains no February 29.)

We need the remainder of V when divided by 10, i.e. V mod 10.

Let N = a b c d (an integer because ages are integers).  
Then V = N⁵ − N.  We want (N⁵ − N) mod 10.

Factor: N⁵ − N = N(N⁴ − 1) = N(N − 1)(N + 1)(N² + 1).

• Among any two consecutive integers, one is even, so the product above is even ⇒ divisible by 2.  
• Among N, N − 1, N + 1, one is a multiple of 5, so the product is divisible by 5.

Therefore N⁵ − N is divisible by both 2 and 5, hence by 10.  
So (N⁵ − N) mod 10 = 0.

Thus the remainder Ralph stated is 0.

We need  

 P = k³ with 10 ≤ k ≤ 99.  (1)

Goal: find the smallest possible N (numerical value).

1. How many digits can N have?  
   • For an m–digit number the largest possible digit–product is 9^m.  
   • The smallest cube in (1) is 10³ = 1000.  
     9² = 81  (<1000) → m ≥ 3  
     9³ = 729 (<1000) → m ≥ 4  
     So N has at least 4 digits.

2. If N had more than 4 digits it would be ≥ 10 000, already larger than many 4–digit
   numbers; hence we only have to examine 4–digit candidates.

   Let the digits be d₁d₂d₃d₄.  Re–ordering the same multiset of digits can only increase
   the numerical value once the digits are arranged in non-decreasing order,
   so the smallest 4–digit number attainable with a given multiset is the sorted one.

3. Upper bound for the product with 4 digits: 9⁴ = 6561.  
   Therefore the only cubes to check are those not exceeding 6561:

        10³ 11³ 12³ 13³ 14³ 15³ 16³ 17³ 18³
        1000 1331 1728 2197 2744 3375 4096 4913 5832

4. Try each cube and look for a factorisation into four allowable digits (1 … 9).

   • 1000 = 2³·5³  
     Only possibility: 5·5·5·8 (because three 5’s supply 5³ and one 8 supplies 2³).  
     Digits 5,5,5,8 → smallest number 5558.

   • 1331 = 11³ – impossible (only prime 11 appears).

   • 1728 = 2⁶·3³.  
     Begin with the smallest possible first digit:

       – If first digit is 3: remaining product must be 1728/3 = 576.  
         The only triple of digits ≤9 with product 576 is 8·8·9.  
         So digits are 3,8,8,9 → smallest number 3889.

       – If first digit is 2: remaining product 864 cannot be achieved with three
         digits ≤9.  
       – If first digit is 1: remaining product would exceed 729 – impossible.

     Hence the only 4–digit realisation for 1728 is 3889.

   • For the larger cubes (2197, 2744, 3375, 4096, 4913, 5832) one checks quickly
     that no factorisation into four digits ≤9 exists (because some prime factor
     exceeds 9 or a required exponent cannot be reached with four digits).

5. Compare the attainable 4–digit numbers: 5558 (from 1000) and 3889 (from 1728).  
   The latter is smaller.

6. Any 5-digit number is at least 10 000 > 3889, so no longer number can beat 3889.

Therefore the least positive integer whose digit–product is the cube of a two-digit
integer is 3889.

42,"One day, a frustrated math teacher lost his patience with his students' non-stop chatting. Thus, he decided to give the ultimate hard problem:
Find the only positive integer number less than 20,000 that is also a sum of three positive integers, all containing exactly 7 factors.

x=[y(sub 1)^K (sub 1)][y(sub 2)^ K (sub 2)]..., where y sub(n) is a prime number, and K sub(n) is the power to which y sub(n) is raised, we can figure out the number of prime factors by:
[K(sub 1) + 1][K(sub 2) + 1]...
For example, the prime factorization of 228 is (2^2)(3^1)(19^1). 228 has 12 factors, since (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12.","16,418.
First, you need to figure out the separate integers. If you have read the hint, you would know how to use prime factorization to your advantage. The only way to get 7 as the number of factors is 1 x 7. So the prime factorization of any number with 7 factors is n^6 times x^0, where n and x are both primes. But if you look, x^0, for all nonzero values of x, is 1! So, any number with exactly 7 factors must be a prime raised to the sixth power. This yields 2^6 +3^6+5^6 = 16418. Any prime 7 or greater to the sixth power is greater than 20,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 –  Which numbers have exactly seven positive divisors?  
For an integer n = p₁^{a₁} p₂^{a₂} … (prime-factorisation),
the number of divisors is (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… .
To obtain 7 divisors we need (a₁+1)(a₂+1)… = 7,
and because 7 is prime this is possible only when a₁+1 = 7 and all the
other factors equal 1.  
Hence a₁ = 6 and n = p^{6}.  

So every positive integer with exactly seven divisors is the sixth power
of a prime.

Step 2 –  List those sixth powers below 20 000.  
2^{6}=64, 3^{6}=729, 5^{6}=15 625  
(the next one, 7^{6}=117 649, already exceeds 20 000).

Thus the only positive integers that themselves possess exactly seven
factors and are <20 000 are

64, 729 and 15 625.

Step 3 –  Form all sums of three
different
numbers taken from {64, 729, 15 625}.  
Because there are just three available candidates, choosing three
different ones forces us to take all of them once:

64 + 729 + 15 625 = 16 418 .

Step 4 –  Check that no other integer <20 000 can be produced in that
way.  

• We have already used every element of {64, 729, 15 625};  
• any other triple would repeat at least one of them, hence would not
consist of three different integers;  
• there are no further sixth powers below 20 000 to use.

Therefore 16 418 is the single positive integer below 20 000 that can be
written as the sum of three positive integers, each of which has exactly
seven divisors.

1.  The 2-digit squares and primes that can appear as consecutive pairs (no zeros allowed) are  
   squares : 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81  primes : 11–97.

   5 → 3,9  6 → 1,4,7  7 → 1,3,9  8 → 1,3,9  9 → 7  

2.  Structural restrictions
   •  No digit may repeat and zero is forbidden, so an 8-digit squime must use exactly eight of the nine digits 1–9.  
   •  Digits 2 and 8 have no in-edges; therefore 8 cannot occur at all (it cannot be first), and 2 must be the first digit.  
   •  Digit 5 has only one in-edge (2 → 5) so 2 must be immediately followed by 5.  
   •  Digit 4 has only one in-edge (6 → 4) so 6 must be immediately followed by 4.  
   •  Digit 9 has only one out-edge (9 → 7); if 9 is not the last digit, it must be followed by 7.

   Consequently every squime is a Hamilton path through the eight digits

Likely source of the “experimental error’’  
The only appreciable discrepancy between the reverse-engineered formula and the
published numbers comes from the fact that Braingle rounds every displayed mean
to the nearest 0.01.  When one works backwards, each rounded figure represents an
interval 0.01 wide, so the reconstructed integer totals – and hence the computed
numbers of positive votes – can be off by 1 in either direction.  No other systematic

Answer: you need some 1-cent and some 3-cent stamps:
1 = 1; 1 + 1 = 2; 3 = 3; 1 + 3 = 4;

46,"Patty O'Furniture, Kurt, & Rod were walking downtown when they spotted a forlorn friend staring at a small object in her hand.  She was propped against a wall, one foot off the ground.
""I know her,"" Patty said.  ""She looks like she could use some help.  I think she broke a heel off her shoe.""
Patty was right; the small object was a 3-inch heel.
""This is my sole sister,"" the girl groaned, ""with the obvious name.""
Kurt looked blank.  After a few seconds, Rod's face lit up.
""Pleased to meet you, Eileen,"" he smirked.
""I wish it could be under better circumstances.  You wouldn't have any superglue on you?  Maybe an extra pair of size-5 sneakers?""
They searched their pockets -- no spare shoes, no modern adhesives.  Kurt fell back on his usual solution for all depressing problems: a Rnkfurer.
""Is that a spare heel?"" Eileen asked.
""No, it's the world's best snack.  Non-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, made of recycled materials, fortified with five vitamins, and contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance of Public Broadcasting.""
""Right,"" she grumbled, ""and it tastes like recycled history essays?""
The three grinned broadly at her.  ""Try one,"" Kurt said, proffering one of the shrink-wrapped torpedoes.
Eileen shifted some of her weight back to the toe of the damaged right shoe and tentatively accepted the Rnkfurer.  She unwrapped it, took one bite, and saw her ecstatic grin reflected on the faces of the other three.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""We were about to go order more tomorrow.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""
Eileen got it right away.  ""So we each get 25 of them, and have 25% of the total.""
Rod grinned.  ""That's cheating.  We use different numbers.""
""Oh, all right.""  She thought for a few seconds.  ""So you can do it a few ways for two people, round off for three, but we couldn't do it for four.""
""Really?""  Rod wasn't as quick with the enlarged problem.  ""I'm not surprised, but that means we'll just have to buy in pairs.""
""Or change the rules a little,"" Eileen added.
""How so?""  Kurt was ready to do almost anything that would get a Rnkfurer refill.
""Well, how about if Kurt buys twice as many as Rod's percentage, Patty gets twice as many as Kurt's percentage ...""
Kurt looked hopeful, Patty was expectant, and Rod's analytical gears were grinding.
""It's a big order, but we could do it,"" he finally declared.
The grocer now orders Rnkfurers only in cases 100, but that didn't disturb anything.  How many did each student get this time?",They got a total of 600 Rnkfurers.,"Rod        405, 67.5% ... 67.5 * 2 = 135
Kurt        135, 22.5% ... 22.5 * 2 = 45
Patti        45, 7.5% ... 7.5 * 2 = 15
Eileen        15
TOTAL 600
Method:
Let E, P, K, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, R+K+P+E.  The math works much like last time, but with four-hundredths instead of percentages.
Since four times Rod's percentage equals Kurt's quantity, and so on for the other three students, we get
2 * 100 * R/T = K.  Rearranging ...
R = K * T/200.  Now, for the other students ...
K = P * T/200
P = E * T/200
Now, look at the common factor, T/200.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
P = E * F
K = P * F = E * F^2
R = K* F = E * F^3
and T = E*(1+F+F^2+F^3)
-------------
Since E, P, and K are each four times a percentage, and those percentages are less than the whole order, E+P+K<200.  All the order amounts are integers; an exhaustive search shows that there are no solutions for F<1.  Since F=1 is ""cheating"", F>1, which means K>P>E, and E<200/3.
E+P+K=E*(1+F+F^2)<200, so
F cannot be more than 13;
K is a multiple of a perfect square (numerator of F^2);
E is a multiple of a perfect cube (denominator of F^3); the cube cannot be more than 4 (4*4*4).
Now, a brute-force search of the finite possibilities for F (numerator 1-13, denominator 1-4) and possible multiples that leave E+P+K<200, we end with only one option where the total is a multiple of 100: F=3 and E=15.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

Reading the sentence cyclically we have

 P = 2·(Kurt’s %) = 2·(100 K / T)    (2)

Substitute successively:

From (1) K = (200 R)/T  
From (2) P = (200 K)/T = (200)^2 R / T²  
From (3) E = (200 P)/T = (200)^3 R / T³  
From (4) R = (200 E)/T = (200)^4 R / T^4  

Divide both sides of the last equality by R (R ≠ 0):

 1 = (200)^4 / T^4  ⇒ T = 200.

With T known, (1) gives K = R; then (2) gives P = R; (3) gives E = R.  
Since R + K + P + E = 200,  

 4R = 200  ⇒ R = 50.

Therefore  
 R = K = P = E = 50.

The grocer’s “cases of 100” are no problem—they order 200 Rnkfurers, i.e. two cases.

48,"You are a scenery creator for plays and you have just been asked to create the Balcony for Romeo and Juliet.
The stage is 7m from the floor to the spotlights.
The balcony has to be a full circle (the other half will act as a platform for the actors waiting on the other side of the wall).
The balcony floor is 30cm thick.
The balcony needs a 1m(height) x 10cm(thickness) solid fence surrounding the perimeter of the half that will be seen by the audience.
The floor of the balcony must be exactly 4m from the ground.
The balcony is like so in order for the spot light (that shines at a 45 degree angle to the roof) will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony.

2.54cm = 1inch","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","[SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h
This added to pi(r)h will yield the volume of the fence surrounding half of the stage.
Thus, the final equation will be:
let a represent the height of the room, then b represent the height of the balcony off the floor, then f represent the thickness of the balcony floor, then r represent a-b or the radius of the balcony floor, then h represent the height of the fence.

• The spot-lights are 7 m above the floor.  
• The balcony floor has to be 4 m above the floor.  
  Vertical drop from the lights to the balcony = 7 m – 4 m = 3 m.  
• The beam makes a 45° angle; at 45° the horizontal reach equals the vertical drop.  
  Therefore the horizontal distance from the centre of the balcony to its edge (its radius) must also be 3 m.

So,   radius r = 3 m = 300 cm.

Step-2:  Volume of the balcony floor (a full circular disc)  
Thickness t = 30 cm = 0.30 m.  
Area = πr² = π(3 m)² = 9π m².  
Volume = Area × thickness = 9π m² × 0.30 m = 2.7π m³.

Convert to cubic centimetres (1 m³ = 1 000 000 cm³):  
V_floor = 2.7π × 1 000 000 = 2 700 000 π cm³.

Step-3:  Volume of the fence (only the front half of the circumference)  
Height h = 1 m = 100 cm.  
Radial thickness w = 10 cm.  
Length of the half-circumference = πr = π(300 cm) = 300π cm.

The fence is simply a “board” 10 cm thick running that length, so  
V_fence = length × thickness × height  
          = 300π cm × 10 cm × 100 cm  
          = 300 000 π cm³.

Step-4:  Total volume of pine required  
V_total = V_floor + V_fence

The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3.

The average of  11 and  47  is 29,
the average of  11 and 71 is  41,
the average of  47 and 71 is  59,
and the average of all three numbers is  43 .",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the three different two–digit primes be denoted by  
a, b, c (with a < b < c).

1.  Pairwise averages  
   Because every two–digit prime is odd, the sum of any two of them is even, so  
   a + b = 2p, a + c = 2q, b + c = 2r  
   where p, q, r must themselves be prime (the three required pairwise averages).

2.  Expressing a, b, c in terms of p, q, r  
   Adding the three equations gives  
   a + b + c = p + q + r.  
   Subtracting in pairs we obtain  
   a = p + q − r, b = p + r − q, c = q + r − p. (★)

3.  Average of all three numbers  
   The problem also demands that (a + b + c)/3 be prime.  
   Using the sum found above, this is  
   (p + q + r)/3.  
   Therefore p + q + r must be divisible by 3 and the quotient must be prime.

   • None of p, q, r can be 3, because an average of two two–digit numbers is at least 11.  
   • Every prime >3 is congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 3).  
     Hence p, q, r must all be congruent to 1 (mod 3) or all to 2 (mod 3) so that their sum is 0 (mod 3).

4.  A successful choice  
   Try primes that are 2 (mod 3):

   p = 29, q = 41, r = 59  (all prime, all ≡ 2 (mod 3))  
   p + q + r = 29 + 41 + 59 = 129, and 129/3 = 43 is prime.

   Now use (★):

   a = p + q − r = 29 + 41 − 59 = 11  
   b = p + r − q = 29 + 59 − 41 = 47  
   c = q + r − p = 41 + 59 − 29 = 71

   All three numbers are two–digit primes.

5.  Verification  
   (a + b)/2 = (11 + 47)/2 = 29 (prime)  
   (a + c)/2 = (11 + 71)/2 = 41 (prime)  
   (b + c)/2 = (47 + 71)/2 = 59 (prime)  
   (a + b + c)/3 = (11 + 47 + 71)/3 = 43 (prime)

   Every required average is indeed prime.

Therefore three such numbers are:

           = 2 · 3² · 5 · 3607 · 3803

So the complete prime factorisation is  
1234567890 = 2 · 3 · 3 · 5 · 3607 · 3803.

To get two factors that are as close together as possible we try to make each one near the square-root of the whole number.  
√1234567890 ≈ 35128.

Put the two large primes into opposite factors and multiply them by suitable small primes:

1) 3607 × (3×3) = 3607 × 9  = 32463  
   Complementary factor = 1234567890 / 32463 = 3803 × 2 × 5 = 38030  
   Difference = 38030 − 32463 = 5567

2) 3607 × (2×5) = 3607 × 10 = 36070  
   Complementary factor = 1234567890 / 36070 = 3803 × 3 × 3 = 34227  
   Difference = 36070 − 34227 = 1843

3) Any other allocation (both big primes together or neither of them) places one factor far from 35128 and gives a much larger difference.

Hence the closest pair is the one in (2).

55,"There was a famous mathematician named Karl Friedrich Gauss. When he was young, he entered Gotinga University. One day he met an old professor, and spoke to him. They chatted, and the professor asked Gauss about his age.
Gauss said: ""The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
The professor said: ""Very good. It's good coincidence because the square and the cube of my age contain each digit from 0 to 9 exactly once.""
How old was Gauss, and how old was the professor?","Eliminate the impossibilities, such as their ages can't end with 0.","Their ages can't end with 0, 1, 5 or 6, and must be either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 9 minus 1 because the sum of its square and its cube or its cube and its fourth power is divisible by 9.
Gauss's age is easy. Since 17^3=4913, 17^4=83521, 22^3=10648, 22^4=234256, Gauss's age is between 18 and 21. The only possibility is 18. 18^3=5832, 18^4=104976.
The professor's age is a little harder. It can be 47 to 99, and the possibilities are: 48, 53, 54, 57, 62, 63, 69, 72, 78, 84, 87, 89, 93, 98, 99. By trial and error, 69 satisfies this condition: 69^2=4761, 69^3=328509.
Therefore, Gauss was 18 and the professor was 69.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let G be Gauss’s age and P the professor’s age.

Gauss’s statement  
“The cube and the fourth power of my age contain each digit 0-9 exactly once”  
means that the decimal digits of G³ and G⁴ together are a permutation of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.  
Hence  

1. G³ has d₃ digits, G⁴ has d₄ digits and d₃+d₄ = 10.  
2. No digit repeats in the concatenation of the two numbers.

Because G is certainly below 100, we test 10 ≤ G ≤ 99 and look for d₃+d₄=10.  
For two–digit numbers G³ has at most 6 digits and G⁴ at most 8 digits, so only (4,6) or (5,5) or (6,4) are possible.  
A short check immediately produces:

G = 18  
18³ =  5 832   (digits 5,8,3,2)  
18⁴ = 104 976  (digits 1,0,4,9,7,6)  

The ten digits 0–9 all appear exactly once.  
Hence Gauss was 18 years old.

––––––––––––––––––––

For the professor we need
“The square and the cube of my age contain each digit 0-9 exactly once”.

Let P² have d₂ digits and P³ have d₃ digits; again d₂+d₃ = 10 and no repetition of digits.

Since P is clearly older than Gauss, try 47 ≤ P ≤ 99 (then P² has 4 digits and P³ has 6 digits, giving 4+6=10).

Testing each number quickly (checking that P² has four distinct digits and P³ has six distinct digits, then that the two digit sets are disjoint) we arrive at one success:

P = 69  
69² = 4 761   (digits 4,7,6,1)  
69³ = 328 509 (digits 3,2,8,5,0,9)

Together these contain each digit 0–9 exactly once with no repetition.

Hence the professor was 69 years old.

Here's how to solve:
Speed of Car 1 = 36 mph
Time taken from point C to B = 9 hrs
thus, distance between C to B = 36 * 9 = 324 miles (Distance = Speed * Time)
Now let the distance between point A and C be 'a' miles and let the speed of Car 2 be 'b' mph.
Thus time taken by Car 1 to travel from A to C = a/36 (Time = Distance/Speed).
and the time taken by car 2 to travel from B to C = 324/b (Distance between C and B is 324 miles as explained above)
Since both the cars meet at C, then these two times are equal, i.e.
a/36 = 324/b
or b = 324 * 36/a =11664/a
Now time taken by Car 2 to travel from C to A can be described as a/b or a*a/11664 (writing b in terms of a).
But it is given that Car 2 takes 4 hrs to travel from C to A. Thus, we get
a * a/11664 = 4
or, a * a = 46656
Now taking square root on both sides, we get a = 216. (distance cannot be negative).
Thus we get b = 11664/216 = 54.

Rnkfurers are a little-known snack: a non-fat frankfurter whose natural flavorants include antivitriolic acids, sesquipedalian hydrocarbons, and golden bail powder.  They're as nutritious as they are delicious, and the only advertising they need is word of mouth ... if you can get your friend to stop eating them long enough to tell you what they are.
Eileen was contemplating how many to buy; the 15 she'd bought hadn't lasted long, and only Patty's generosity had kept her from exorcising her craving by writing an acrostic sonnet about the treats during English class.
Now, after school, they were on their way to the local grocery store for their next order, strolling along in iambic pentameter.  Patty plodded as Eileen's step provided the stresses.  Gradually, they realized they could hear singing of a sort coming from up the street.  The voices matched their pace -- one high and lilting in C-major, the other percussive and in the key of ""off"".  As the two girls advanced, they tracked the sound to a large elm in Desire Creek's front yard.  Patty spotted a red sneaker on one branch and grinned.

""1184 and 1210.""
""That's a lot, even for us.  Besides, they come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, and we get a price break on the larger cases.""
""Well, how about an aliquot sequence?""
""Okay.  How does it taste?"" Patty asked.
""Can you hum a few bars?"" Eileen offered at the same time.
Robin laughed.  ""No, it's a series of numbers, each one being the sum of the previous number's divisors.  For instance, start with 12.  Its divisors add up to 16.  16's divisors add up to 15, then 9, and it's downhill from there.""
Eileen and Patty understood.  ""So, you just don't have to get back to your starting point?""
""Right.  Some of the sequences seem to go on for a long time, but a few stick in the same neighborhood for a few terms.""
""Well, do you have any of those handy?""
""It depends; how many of these do we want to order?  You two know what makes a week's supply, I hope?""
""Sure.""  Patty spoke as the veteran Rnkfurerphile.  ""At least 100 each, but probably not much more over the long haul.""
Jay and Robin shared a glance.  ""Robin, is your homework still in your pack?""
""It sure is.  One aliquot sequence coming up, the first four terms between 100 and 200, and the sum is divisible by 25.""
Ten minutes later, the four friends were in the grocery store, ordering their Rnkfurers.  What are the four quantities in the sequence?",You can leave out numbers that are primes (sum of proper divisors is 1) or the product of two primes (sum of divisors will be less than 100).  This will shorten your search somewhat.,"108, 172, 136, and 134.
Method:
This one really requires a brute-force approach.  The sigma function (sum of a number's divisors) does not lend itself to 3rd-order analysis (3 numbers past the first one).  Most of the remaining numbers will leave the 100-200 range on the first or second iteration.  I used a small computer program.  The only sequence that stays in bounds for 4 terms is the one given.
Side notes:
The name ""Desire Creek"" is a nod to ""Desire Under the Elms"" and the ""Elm Creek Quilt"" books.
There are 4-cycles of amicable numbers.  However, the least quadruple is a little large, even for Patty's appetite: 1264460, 1547860, 1727636, 1305184.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

s(n) = σ(n) – n = “sum of the proper divisors of n”.  
An aliquot sequence is … , n₀ , n₁ , n₂ , … with n_{k+1}=s(n_k).

The problem asks for four consecutive terms n₀ , n₁ , n₂ , n₃ such that  

• 100 ≤ n_k ≤ 200 for k = 0,1,2,3, and  
• n₀ + n₁ + n₂ + n₃ is divisible by 25.

Step 1 – list s(n) for 100 ≤ n ≤ 200

(The factorisation is written first, then σ(n), then s(n)=σ(n)–n.)

100 = 2²·5²  σ=217 s=117  
101 prime   s=1  
102 = 2·3·17  σ=216 s=114  
103 prime   s=1  
104 = 2³·13  σ=210 s=106  
…  
(continuing this way for every n from 100 to 200)

From this table one records every n whose image s(n) is still in the 100–200 band, then one checks s(s(n)), and so on.  
Only four starting values keep the first four terms in range:

1. 102 → 114 → 126 → 186 (sum 528)  
2. 108 → 172 → 136 → 134 (sum 550)  
3. 114 → 126 → 186 → 198 (sum 624)  
4. 190 → 170 → 154 → 134 (sum 648)

Step 2 – test the divisibility condition

528 ≡ 3·25+3  not divisible by 25  
624 ≡ 25·24+24 not divisible by 25  
648 ≡ 25·25+23 not divisible by 25  
550 = 25·22     divisible by 25 ✔

Thus the unique sequence satisfying both requirements is obtained from the starting value 108.

Verification of the aliquot steps

n₀ = 108 : proper divisors 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,27,36,54 sum to 172  
n₁ = 172 : proper divisors 1,2,4,43,86 sum to 136  
n₂ = 136 : proper divisors 1,2,4,8,17,34,68 sum to 134  
n₃ = 134 : proper divisors 1,2,67, … (next term not needed)

All four terms are between 100 and 200 and their total is 550 = 25 × 22.

Therefore the four quantities of Rnkfurers the friends order are

108, 172, 136 and 134.

64,"The All-Portland Rock-Scissors-Paper League follows the canonical rules: at a given signal, both contestants reveal their choices.  Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  However, for tournament play, the stakes are altered.  Losers pay winners 3 chips if the latter wins with ""rock"", 2 points with ""scissors"", and 1 point with ""paper"".  Each minute, everyone must find a new opponent, play one ""throw"", pay off, and get ready for the next switch.
The players with the most chips at the end of the evening get the big prizes: first place is a bag of Portland cement, second is a hedge trimmer, and third place is a choice of stationery.  Also, any chips you've won are redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Knowing nothing about the other players' preference, mind games, etc., what's your best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining your balance of chips throughout the evening?","(1) The answer is not 1:1:1; this loses to people who throw nothing but rocks.
(2) This is a ""zero-sum"" game: what one player wins, the other loses.
(3) The game is ""symmetric"": everyone is playing with the same information, the same options, and the same risks.
(4) The game is ""open"": there is no hidden information, such as secret agreements or rules that only one player knows.","Randomly throw paper 1/2 the time, rock 1/3 of the time, and scissors the remaining 1/6.
Method:
To avoid dredging through matrix math, I'll present a couple of basic principles of game theory.
(1) Playing the best strategy possible allows you to expose your overall strategy to your opponent without affecting your expected payoff.  No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.
(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.
(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.
(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.
With these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.
So, we're looking to mix our ""throws"" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.  This yields the equation
E = 0*R -3*S +1*P
where
E = expected payoff
R = proportion of rocks
S = proportion of scissors
P = proportion of paper
Against an all-paper opponent:
E = -1*R + 2*S -0*P
Against someone running with scissors all the time:
E = 3*R + 0*S -1*P
We know that E=0; we can now solve the three equations in three variables.  We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get
S = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.
Q.E.D.
I realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.  Rather, note that what *beats* rock gets the highest share, and what beats scissors gets the next highest.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• R = probability you throw Rock  
• P = probability you throw Paper  
• S = probability you throw Scissors (R+P+S = 1).

Chip payoff to you in every possible encounter (positive if you get chips, negative if you pay) is

               opponent  
         Rock Paper Scissors  
you Rock     0   –1     +3  
you Paper   +1    0     –2  
you Sciss  –3   +2      0

For a given opponent choice your expected gain is  

vs Rock : P – 3 S  
vs Paper: –R + 2 S  
vs Sciss: 3 R – 2 P.

Since you “know nothing” about opponents, you protect yourself against the worst case: choose (R,P,S) that maximises the minimum of these three numbers.  
In a zero-sum game this means making the opponent indifferent, i.e. setting the three expectations equal to the same value V:

1) P – 3 S = –R + 2 S  → R + P = 5 S  
2) P – 3 S = 3 R – 2 P → P = R + S

Solve: from 2) P = R + S.  
Insert in 1): R + (R + S) = 5 S → 2 R = 4 S → R = 2 S.  
Hence P = R + S = 3 S.

Thus R : P : S = 2 : 3 : 1.  
Normalising,

 R = 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 33 %  
 P = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50 %  
 S = 1/6 ≈ 17 %.

With this mix each of the three expected payoffs equals

 V = P – 3 S = 1/2 – 3·(1/6) = 0,

so no opponent can obtain an edge and your expected chip balance stays level.

Final answer: play Rock one-third of the time, Paper one-half of the time, and Scissors one-sixth of the time (ratio 2 : 3 : 1).",True
65,"The card game Snapoker is a very complex game for four players, requiring the use of two decks of cards with all odd spades, even hearts, prime diamonds (including aces) and non-prime clubs (including aces) removed.  Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts ""Let's Snapoker!""  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of ""Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!"" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
Assume that all four players are equally matched at card-grabbing such that, following the grab, the cards are evenly distributed amongst all four players.  What is the lowest card total at which you can be assured you will not be required to drink a glass of milk through your nose in order to break a tie for the maximum 4 points?",Create the largest tie,"If all four players hold the same number of cards, the lowest card total that would never require a tie-break is 142.
If all four players hold the same number of cards, the highest single hand card total at which a tie-breaker might be needed is 141.  In this case, the two players who would be required to drink milk through their noses would each have had a hand consisting of a joker and two 8s, 9s, 10s, jacks, queens and kings.  Any score above 141 can not be duplicated in a single hand of Snapoker, thus making 142 the lowest total to which a tie-breaker will not need to be applied.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – work out what cards are in the pack and their values  
For one ordinary 52-card deck we keep

• Spades even ranks 2,4,6,8,10,12 (6 cards)  
• Hearts odd  A(1),3,5,7,9,11,13 (7 cards)  
• Diamonds non–prime 4,6,8,9,10,12 (6 cards)  
• Clubs prime 2,3,5,7,11,13 (6 cards)

25 cards are kept from each deck.  
With two decks we therefore have 50 ordinary cards, and the two added jokers (value 15) make 52 cards in all.

Counting the cards of each value in the double (2-deck) pack gives  

value 1 (ace) 2 cards  
values 2–13  four of each  
value 15 (joker) 2 cards

Step 2 – total value of the whole pack  
Sum = 2(1) + 4(2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13) + 2(15)  
      = 2  + 4·78               + 30  
      = 2  + 312                + 30 = 392.

The 52 cards are dealt (after the piggy-grab) equally, so every player gets 13 cards.  
Average hand value = 392 / 4 = 98.

Step 3 – the largest possible totals two different players can share  
If two different players together hold 26 cards, the greatest total they can possibly share is obtained by taking the 26 highest-valued cards in the whole pack:

2×15  + 4×13 + 4×12 + 4×11 + 4×10 + 4×9 + 4×8  
= 30  + 52   + 48   + 44   + 40   + 36  + 32 = 282.

Therefore, for two players to tie they must each have at most ⌊282/2⌋ = 141 points, because, with 26 cards, the sum 282 cannot be exceeded.

Step 4 – the critical total  
Hence, if YOUR hand is worth 142 or more points, the following are simultaneously true:

• No other player can reach 142 (because two such hands would require 284 points in 26 cards, more than the 26 highest cards can provide).  
• Therefore no other player can beat 142 either.  
• Consequently you win the hand outright and no tie-breaking milk-through-the-nose contest can arise.

Step 5 – is 142 achievable?  
Yes.  For example the 13-card set  
15, 13,13, 12,12, 11,11, 10,10, 9,9,9, 8  
sums to 142, so such a hand can occur.

Conclusion  
The smallest hand-total that guarantees you will not have to face a tie-breaker for the top score is 142.

66,"There are ten natural numbers, two of which are equal. Adding any nine of them, we can get the following sums:

The sum of the ten numbers is (783+90)/9=97.  The largest number is found by subtracting the lowest sum of nine numbers (which excluded the largest of the ten numbers) from the sum of all ten numbers.  Thus: 97-82=15.  15 is the largest number of the ten.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the 10 natural numbers be  

a₁ , a₂ , … , a₁₀  (exactly two of them are equal).

Denote their total sum by  
S = a₁ + a₂ + … + a₁₀ .

1.  Each “nine–number sum’’ is S minus the number that was left out.  
   Hence the multiset  
   { S – a₁ , S – a₂ , … , S – a₁₀ }  
   is the multiset of the given values.

2.  We are told that only nine different sums are obtained:
   82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92.  
   Since there are 10 numbers, one of these nine values must occur twice;  
   that duplication corresponds to the two equal numbers.

3.  The smallest nine-number sum (82) is obtained when the largest single
   number is omitted, so the largest number is S – 82.  
   The largest nine-number sum (92) is obtained when the smallest number is
   omitted, so the smallest number is S – 92.  
   Therefore largest − smallest = (S – 82) – (S – 92) = 10.

4.  Add the ten nine-number sums.  Each of the 10 original numbers appears in
   exactly 9 of those sums, so

        (sum of 10 nine-number sums) = 9 S.

   Let x be the value that is repeated.  Then

        9 S = (82+83+84+85+87+89+90+91+92) + x
            = 783 + x.

   Because 9 S is divisible by 9, 783 + x must be divisible by 9; 783 already
   is, so x itself must be a multiple of 9.  
   The only multiple of 9 in the list is 90, so x = 90 is the repeated sum.

5.  Now 9 S = 783 + 90 = 873, so S = 873 / 9 = 97.

6.  The nine distinct numbers are S minus each distinct sum:

        97−82 = 15

        97−85 = 12
        97−87 = 10
        97−89 =  8
        97−90 =  7   (this one occurs twice)
        97−91 =  6
        97−92 =  5

   Thus the ten numbers are

67,"Jack and Jill are climbing down a vertical wall.  They both use ropes hanging from the ceiling of a huge room.  They start at the same time from the top of the wall which is 16 meters tall.  The race is divided into two stages; the first 8 meters and the last 8 meters.  A penalty of half a minute waiting time is placed upon whoever loses the first stage (first 8 meters) and it commences as soon as the winner finishes the first 8 meters.
The following describes their climbing techniques:
1. Jack climbs down in a zigzag way (moving one step downwards diagonally at a fixed angle from the horizon line).  In each step movement he completes the distance of 1 meter diagonally.  Initially, his feet are distant 60 cm apart aligned on a perfectly horizontal line.  It takes him 15 seconds to complete each move.  Jack has to rest for 1 minute for every 8 meters he vertically completes.
2. Jill hops down according to a perfect half circular arc movement.  In each hop, she moves a distance of 1.57 meters along the arc path (not the vertical).  It takes her 15 seconds to complete each hop.  Jill has to rest for 1 minute for every 6 meters she vertically completes.

Replacing A by the diagonally crossed distance, B by the distance between Jack's feet and C by the vertically climbed distance:

Jack  
• One diagonal step = 1 m.  
• His feet are 0.60 m apart horizontally, therefore the horizontal component of the step is 0.60 m.  
• By Pythagoras the vertical component is  
  √(1² – 0.60²) = √(1 – 0.36) = √0.64 = 0.80 m.

Jill  
• One hop is a half-circular arc 1.57 m long.  
• 1.57 m = π r ⇒ r = 0.50 m, so the arc is a semicircle of radius 0.50 m.  
• The vertical distance between the endpoints of a semicircle is its diameter, 2r = 1.00 m.  
Thus one hop lowers her by 1.00 m.

Step 2 –  Work out the first 8 m (stage 1)  

Jack  
• Needs 8 m / 0.8 m = 10 steps.  
• Time for the 10 steps = 10 × 15 s = 150 s.  
• He now must take his compulsory 1-min (60 s) rest.  
• Finishes stage 1 at t = 150 s and rests from 150 s to 210 s.

Jill  
• Needs 8 m / 1 m = 8 hops.  
• Time for the 8 hops = 8 × 15 s = 120 s.  
• After 6 m (6 hops, 90 s) she must rest 1 min, i.e. 90 s–150 s.  
• After that rest she would start hop 7 at 150 s, but Jack has already finished.  
• Penalty: as soon as Jack finishes (150 s) Jill must wait an extra 30 s (to 180 s).  
• She therefore does hop 7 (180–195 s) and hop 8 (195–210 s).  
• She reaches the 8-m mark at 210 s.

Stage 1 winner: Jack (finished at 150 s).  
The penalty has delayed Jill by exactly 30 s.

Step 3 –  The second 8 m (stage 2)  

Both start stage 2 at the same instant 210 s:

Jack  
• Again needs 10 steps → 150 s.  
• Finishes the descent at 210 s + 150 s = 360 s.

Jill  
• Needs another 8 hops.  
• After 4 more hops (to 12 m total) she must rest a second minute.  
 210–225 s hop 9 (9 m)  
 225–240 s hop 10 (10 m)  
 240–255 s hop 11 (11 m)  
 255–270 s hop 12 (12 m) ––> rest 270–330 s  
• Last 4 hops:  
 330–345 s hop 13 (13 m)  
 345–360 s hop 14 (14 m)  
 360–375 s hop 15 (15 m)  
 375–390 s hop 16 (16 m)  
• She reaches the ground at 390 s.

Step 4 –  Compare finishing times  

Jack: 360 s = 6 min  
Jill: 390 s = 6 min 30 s  

Therefore Jack wins, and Jill needs an additional 30 seconds, i.e. ½ minute, to finish.

68,"Martin rushed into the room bearing good news.
""Joseph, your idea worked! The company liked the idea of using only two types of weights to measure heavy objects!"" announced Martin, giving the letter to Joseph.
""I told you so. Given any two types of weights, you can measure objects that are above a certain weight,"" explained Joseph, reading the letter, ""Well, as long as the two weights are not both even.""
Martin thought for a moment and then realized that he had no clue what Joseph meant by that, so he asked, ""Huh? What? Isn't the new weight system designed to measure all types of objects?""
Joseph smiled and replied, ""Technically, yes. However, this system can't measure objects that weigh 1 pound, 2 pounds and other lighter objects. Besides, both weights are heavier than 10 pounds.""
""Really? But then why did the company like it?"" wondered Martin, ""What use does it have then? Can it measure 300 pounds? 90 pounds? 69 pounds?!""
""Yes, yes, and no."" Joseph laughed, ""You're not getting the point. The company only weighs things 120 pounds or heavier. This weighing system can't measure 119 pounds but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights.""
After hearing that, Martin was even more confused. Finally, Joseph said, ""Look, 17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't. It works on the same principles. Think about it. You'll get it eventually.""

What is the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of 3s and 4s? The answer is 5. Try it out with other numbers. You'll find a pattern eventually.,"The two weights are 11 and 13.
If you played around with the hint, you'll realize that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of Xs and Ys is equal to (X-1)(Y-1) - 1.
We are told that the largest number that can not be expressed as a sum of a combination of the two weights is 119.
Thus,
119 = (x-1)(y-1) - 1
120 = (x-1)(y-1)
From here, we only have to list 120's factors: (1,120), (2,60), (3,40), (4,30), (5,24), (6,20), (8,15), (10,12).  There are 8 possible combinations.
However, we were told that both weights were above 10 pounds. Thus, only one pair remains (10,12). So, x=11 and y=13.
Try it out. You can't make 119 using only 11s and 13s but you can make 120 and above using only 11s and 13s.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two (integer) weights be a lb and b lb, with a,b > 10.  
Because every load of 120 lb or more is measurable while 119 lb is not, 119 is the largest non-measurable weight.  

For two weight sizes that are relatively prime, the largest unattainable weight (the Frobenius number) equals
 ab − a − b.

Hence
 ab − a − b = 119  
⇒ ab − a − b + 1 = 120  
⇒ (a − 1)(b − 1) = 120.                                     (1)

Both a − 1 and b − 1 must therefore be positive divisors of 120 and each is at least 10 (because a,b > 10).

The factor pairs of 120 with both factors ≥ 10 are only

 10 × 12 and 12 × 10.

Taking (a − 1, b − 1) = (10,12) gives (a,b) = (11,13).  
The reverse ordering gives the same two sizes.

Check: gcd(11,13)=1, so the formula for the Frobenius number applies, and

 11·13 − 11 − 13 = 143 − 24 = 119.

Thus every weight ≥ 120 lb is a non-negative integer combination of 11 lb and 13 lb, while 119 lb and smaller weights need not be.

Example confirmations  
• 300 lb = 13 lb × 9 + 11 lb × 3  
• 90 lb = 13 lb × 1 + 11 lb × 7  
• 69 lb cannot be expressed (solving 13x+11y=69 gives no non-negative integer solution).

Therefore the only possible pair that fulfills all the stated conditions is

11-pound weights and 13-pound weights.

The first mathematicians says, ""I have a positive integer number of children, whose ages are positive integers. The sum of their ages is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.""
The other person replies, ""How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, I could work out their individual ages?""
""No, you could not.""
""Aha! At last, I know how old you are!""
Apparently the second mathematician had been trying to determine the first mathematician's age for some time. Now, what was the number of the bus?
The bus number is a positive integer and the mathematicians know the bus number.","There are multiple possible age combinations for the mathematician's children that would result in the same age as well as the same bus number otherwise the second mathematician can determine the ages of the children given the first mathematician's age and number of children.
Also, there must be at least three children because the second mathematician could work out the ages of the children if there are only one or two children.","The bus number is 12. First, we know that the age of the first mathematician (A), the number of children (N), and the bus number (B) cannot be used by the second mathematician to determine the children's ages (C) based on the problem. At this point, we know that C must be at least 3; A, N, and B cannot be used to find C; and that there are multiple combinations for C. This is all the information that can be gathered from the problem, so we just plug in numbers for B and see if the results don't violate the parameters we have established. 1 and 2 are automatically ruled out because that would mean less than three children are present. If we take a random number like 5 for B, we then plot out all possible values for A, N, and C. The A and N must be between 1 and 5. The children's ages must be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 2, 2; 1, 4; or 5. However, the second mathematician can easily determine the ages of the children given A and N. This will be true for all of the numbers lower than the correct answer. As we work our way into higher bus numbers this uniqueness disappears, but it's replaced by another problem — the second mathematician must be able to deduce the first mathematician's age despite the ambiguity. For example, if the bus number is 21 and the first mathematician tells us that he's 96 years old and has three children, then it's true that we can't work out the children's ages: They might be 1, 8, and 12 or 2, 3, and 16.

73,"Achmed and Ali were camel-drivers and on one day they decided to quit their job. They wanted to become shepherds. So they went to the market and sold all their camels. The amount of money (dinars) they received for each camel was the same as the total number of camels they owned. With that money they bought as many sheep as possible at 10 dinars a sheep. With the money that was left they bought a goat.
On their way home they got in a fight and decided to split up. When they divided the sheep there was one sheep left. So Ali said to Achmed, ""I take the last sheep and you can get the goat"". ""That's not fair,"" said Achmed, ""a goat costs less than a sheep"". ""OK,"" Ali said, ""then I will give you one of my dogs and then we are even"". And Achmed agreed.

A sheep is 10 dinars, but what does a goat cost?
The money they received for their camels is a square. And the digit in the tens-place of this square is odd (total money / 10 dinars), because they could not divide the sheep equally.
Now the interesting thing is that all squares with an odd tens-place end with a 6. (16^2 = 256, 24^2 = 576). So a goat must cost 6 dinars.
10 - 6 = 2 dogs
So a dog costs 2 dinars.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

C = total number of camels they owned  
p = price (in dinars) received for each camel  

The problem states p = C, so the money they got from selling the camels was  

M = C · p = C · C = C²  (dinars).

They spent that money on sheep at 10 dinars each and bought one goat with the remainder.

Let  

g = price of the goat (0 < g < 10, because a goat costs less than a sheep),  
S = number of sheep bought.  

Then  
C² = 10 S + g.                        (1)

When they tried to divide the S sheep equally, one sheep was left over, i.e. S is odd.  
Write S = 2k + 1 with k an integer.

Ali keeps the “last” sheep (worth 10 dinars) and gives Achmed the goat plus a dog.  
Value-wise we therefore have

g + d = 10,                           (2)

where d is the (unknown) price of one dog.

Goal: determine d.

-------------------------------------------------
Using modular arithmetic
-------------------------------------------------
From (1) reduce modulo 10:

C² ≡ g (mod 10).                      (3)

Squares modulo 10 can only be 0,1,4,5,6,9, so  
g ∈ {1,4,5,6,9}.                      (4)

Now write (1) as C² = 10(2k+1) + g = 20k + (10 + g).  
Hence

C² ≡ 10 + g (mod 20).                (5)

Compute possible square residues modulo 20:

n² (mod 20) ∈ {0,1,4,5,9,16}.                   

Thus 10 + g must be one of {0,1,4,5,9,16}.  
But 10 + g is between 11 and 19, so the only possible match is 16.  
Therefore

10 + g = 16  ⇒  g = 6.               (6)

-------------------------------------------------
Price of a dog
-------------------------------------------------
Insert g = 6 into (2):

g + d = 10  ⇒  6 + d = 10  ⇒  d = 4.

So each dog is worth 4 dinars.

-------------------------------------------------
Check
-------------------------------------------------
Because g = 6, (1) gives C² ≡ 6 (mod 10); such squares exist (e.g. C = 4,6,14,16,…).  
For those C we have C² ≡ 16 (mod 20), making S = (C² – 6)/10 odd, exactly as required.  
All conditions are consistent, yielding a unique dog price of 4 dinars.

74,"Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.
The system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.
So: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.
The problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales. What was their solution?","The title has a slight hint.
The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights.","The minimum number of weights is 5.
weight 1 = 1 stone = 3^0
weight 2 = 3 stone = 3^1
weight 3 = 9 stone = 3^2
weight 4 = 2 lump 5 stone = 27 stone = 3^3
weight 5 = 7 lump 4 stone = 81 stone = 3^4
All five added together weigh one mass, and allow the weighing of any measure down to one stone.
The progression from one stone to one mass would be:
1, 3-1, 3, 3 +1, 9-3-1, 9-3, 9-3 + 1, 9-1, 9, 27-9-3-1, 27-9-3, ....",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let every weight be expressed in the smallest unit, the stone.
One mass = 11 lumps = 11·11 stone = 121 stone,  
so we must be able to weigh any whole number of stone from 1 up to 121 inclusive.

Because a balance scale allows us to put weights on the same pan as the object
(to “subtract” their values) as well as on the opposite pan (to “add” their
values), each weight can be used with the coefficients –1, 0 or +1.
Hence every number we must weigh has to be written with digits –1, 0, 1.
The positional-value system that does exactly this is balanced ternary, whose
place-values are the powers of 3 :

…, 81, 27, 9, 3, 1            (3⁴, 3³, 3², 3¹, 3⁰).

If we take the five lowest such powers

1 stone, 3 stone, 9 stone, 27 stone, 81 stone,

their total is
1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 stone,

so with them we can weigh anything up to and including 121 stone.
Moreover, this choice is optimal: with k weights the largest total that can be
covered is

1 + 3 + 3² + … + 3^{k–1} = (3^{k} – 1)/2,

and setting (3^{k} – 1)/2 ≥ 121 gives k ≥ 5.  
Thus no set of four or fewer weights can suffice.

Expressed in the native units the five weights are
• 1 stone  
• 3 stone  
• 9 stone  
• 27 stone = 2 lumps + 5 stone  
• 81 stone = 7 lumps + 4 stone.

With these five pieces one can weigh every whole weight from 1 stone to 1 mass
(121 stone) by placing some of the weights on the same pan as the object and
the rest on the opposite pan.

77,"I always remember the days when I was at high school, whiling away my time with my friends. Those were the days when I'd spent the maximum time with my grandfather Rudolf the world-famous Romankachi. He'd come over to our house at one of the weekends leaving behind his Romankachi estate in the village in capable hands. One day when I returned home from school, he put this clock problem in front of me which I was required to solve in the alloted time frame.
Considering time represented in twelve hour format H:M1M2 where H is a single-digit or a two-digit number indicating the hours and M1 and M2 the digits indicating the minutes (M1 representing the tens digit of the minutes and M2 the units digit of the minutes), he wanted me to find out that in a day how such instances would occur so that H is exactly divisible by M1 and gives M2 as quotient?
He further added that if H:M1M2 was the time represented in 24-hour format instead of a 12-hour format, then how many instances were there in a day such that H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as the quotient? In the 24 hour format, 12 o' clock midnight is represented as 00:00.",divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.,"Clearing the scope of the problem, we have to divide H by M1 getting M2 as the quotient with remainder as 0.
First let us consider the time format to be a 12-hour format.
Here H can take values from 1 to 12.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 1 to 9 i.e., 9 values, for H = 1 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 1 to 6 i.e., 6 values, for H = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 1 to 4 i.e., 4 values, for H = 3, 6, 9, and 12.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 1 to 3 i.e., 3 values, for H = 4, 8, and 12.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 1 to 2 i.e., 2 values, for H = 5 and 10.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.
Hence the total = 9+6+4+3+2 = 24
This is for 12 hours.
In a day the number of instances where H is exactly divisible by M1 giving M2 as quotient is =
24 * 2 = 48 instances in a 12-hour format.
Now let us consider the time format to be a 24-hour format.
Here H can take values from 0 to 23.
For M1 = 0, no value exists since divisor itself is 0.
For M1 = 1, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0 to 9.
For M1 = 2, M2 takes values from 0 to 9 i.e., 10 values, for H = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.
For M1 = 3, M2 takes values from 0 to 7 i.e., 8 values, for H = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
For M1 = 4, M2 takes values from 0 to 5 i.e., 6 values, for H = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.
For M1 = 5, M2 takes values from 0 to 4 i.e., 5 values, for H = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Any further values of M1 cannot be considered since M1M2 will then exceed 60 minutes which is not possible.

SQUARE(854) = 729316
Both the equations use each of the digits 1 to 9 once each. These are the only two numbers with this property. Try using some operations on these numbers to see if there are any interesting findings",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let us look for a numerical property that both 567 and 854 share.

1. Start with the obvious possibilities – parity, divisibility by 3, etc.  
   • 567 is odd; 854 is even → no parity match.  
   • 567 : digit-sum 5 + 6 + 7 = 18, divisible by 3; 854 : digit-sum 8 + 5 + 4 = 17, not divisible by 3 → no common factor 3.

2. Test divisibility by 7 (rule: split off the last digit, double it, subtract from the rest, repeat until small):  
   • 567 → 56 − 2·7 = 56 − 14 = 42, and 42 is divisible by 7 → 567 divisible by 7.  
   • 854 → 85 − 2·4 = 85 − 8 = 77, and 77 is divisible by 7 → 854 divisible by 7.

3. Factor each number completely to see whether any larger common factor occurs:  
   567 = 7 × 81 = 7 × 3⁴  
   854 = 7 × 122 = 7 × 2 × 61  
   After the single factor 7 the remaining pieces (3⁴ versus 2 × 61) have no factor in common, so 7 is the greatest common divisor.

4. Confirm with the Euclidean algorithm:  
   gcd(854, 567)  
   → 854 − 567 = 287  
   → gcd(567, 287)  
   → 567 − 2·287 = 567 − 574 = −7 (equivalently 567 mod 287 = 280)  
   → gcd(287, 280)  
   → 287 − 280 = 7  
   → gcd(280, 7) = 7.  
   Thus gcd(854, 567) = 7.

Therefore the unique numerical link between the two is that both lie in the 7-times table and share no larger common divisor.

Final answer: 567 and 854 are both exact multiples of 7; their greatest common divisor is 7.",True

Each triangular piece would have as its base one unit of the perimeter; the other two sides would be formed by cuts to the center of the cake. Every triangle would have the same altitude (3 units) giving the same area (A = ½ * b * h = ½ * 1 * 3 = 3/2 square units). 8 adjacent triangles, even though they include a corner or two, will be 12 square units or 1/3 of the ""inner"" cake.
Before we make any actual cuts, we return the ignored 28 portions to the picture and then make those three cuts extended to the true perimeter.

83,"Oh no! Our flag has fallen down from the flag pole (stupid cheap string)! Quick, we need to figure out how much string we need to get it back up there...

Use the Pythagorean theorem.","If the pulley system is attached 1 meter off the ground and the flag's height is equal to the ground to the pulley system, then the flag must be 1 meter high. If the string only goes up from the pulley system to the bottom of the flag and the flag pole is 14 meters in height, then the string must cover 12 meters in total (14-1-1).
If the diameter of the pole is 10cm and the height covered is 12 meters (1200cm), then, unwrapped in to a rectangle, it would be pi(10) (since the circumference of a circle is pi{d}) by 1200 cm rectangle.
If the string wraps around in 4 even rotations, that means the rectangle divided on the y plane into 4 equal sections would represent one rotation per section. Finding the hypotenuse of each section (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) would then yield the distance covered per rotation.

The string's distance in one rotation would be expressed by the following equation:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = [300^2 + pi(10)^2]^1/2
Therefore, in 4 rotations it would be the above * 4.
The final equation is thus expressed as:
let a represent the total height of the pole, then f represent the height of the flag, then rot represent the number of rotations, then p represent the height of the pulley, then d represent the diameter of the pole
s = rot * [ ({a-f-p}/4)^2 + d(pi)^2 ]^½

= 4 * [ 90 000 + 10(pi)^2 ]^½

1.  Let n = number of votes that have been cast for a given attribute, and
    p = number of “positive” votes on that attribute  
    (for fun a “+” vote, for difficulty a “hard” vote).

2.  From the data for Teaser A (fun)
        before : r = 2.00 with n = 6, after our + : r = 2.29 with n = 7  
    we must have  

           rbefore = k·p/n,        rafter = k·(p+1)/(n+1)

    Solving these two equations gives k = 4.  
    Doing the same check with every other line of data gives the same k.

    Hence the site’s rating formula is

                rating  =  4 · ( # positive votes / # votes )

    (4 corresponds to “100 % positive”, 0 corresponds to “0 % positive”, so the
     published numbers run from 0.00 to 4.00.)

3.  With this formula we can work backwards, attribute by attribute, to find
    n and p just before our vote.  
    For example, for Teaser B (fun)

        1.14 = 4·p/ n        ⇒  p/n = 0.285
        1.00 = 4·p/(n+1)     ⇒  p/(n+1) = 0.250

        ⇒ p = 2 ,  n = 7.

    Doing the same algebra for every attribute gives:

Results (before our vote)

Teaser A
    Fun :  3 positive out of 6 votes
    Diff : 2 positive out of 6 votes

Teaser B
    Fun :  2 positive out of 7 votes
    Diff : 1 positive out of 6 votes

Teaser C

We are told D(N) is a multiple of N, i.e.  
4N − 1107 ≡ 0 (mod N) ⇒ −1107 ≡ 0 (mod N) ⇒ N | 1107.

Since N must be > 1000 but < 10 000, the only divisor of 1107 in that range is 1107 itself (1107 = 3³ × 41, and all other divisors are smaller).

Check:  
D(1107) = 4·1107 − 1107 = 3·1107 = 3321, which indeed is 3 × 1107.

1.  Let the common two–digit sum be  &$ = 10a + b$  with digits  
    & = a,  $ = b.

2.  From the multiplication (# denotes a digit)  

        # × $ = &$ = 10a + b

    gives      b(# – 1) = 10a.  
    Put k = # – 1 (k = 1,…,8).  Then  

        bk = 10a.

3.  Looking at 1–9 digits we get the possible (a,b,#) triples

        (1,2,6)   → &$ = 12
        (2,4,6)   → &$ = 24         (two-digit sums of two digits can’t reach 24 ⇒ impossible)
        (1,5,3)   → &$ = 15
        (3,5,7)   → &$ = 35         (too large for any two-digit sum of two digits)
        (4,5,9)   → &$ = 45         (too large)
        (4,8,6)   → &$ = 48         (too large)

    So only &$ = 12 or 15 remain.

4.  If &$ = 12 (a = 1, b = 2, # = 6)

        \ + ^ = 11,      ? + ^ = 6.

    These force ^ to be 4 or less, but the remaining digits ≥3; contradiction.  
    Therefore &$ ≠ 12.

5.  Take &$ = 15 (a = 1, b = 5, # = 3).  
    Remaining digits: {2,4,6,7,8,9}.

        \  +  >  = 15                     …(1)
        ^  +  %  = 15                     …(2)
        ?  +  >  +  @ = 15                …(3)

        3 + ? + ^ = 15  ⇒  ? + ^ =12     …(5)

    From (4)  \ = 14 – ^.  
    From (5)  ? = 12 – ^.  
    From (1)  > = 15 – \ = 1 + ^.

    Insert these in (3):

        (12 – ^) + (1 + ^) + @ = 15  ⇒  @ = 2.

    Digit 2 is now fixed, and still unused.  
    The remaining pool {4,6,7,8,9} must supply ^, \, >, ?, %.

    Try values for ^:

        ^ = 4   ⇒  \ = 10 (invalid)
        ^ = 6   ⇒  ? = 6 (duplicate)
        ^ = 7   ⇒  \ = 7 (duplicate)
        ^ = 8   ⇒  \ = 6,   ? = 4,   > = 9   (all valid)

    With ^ = 8 equation (2) gives  % = 15 – 8 = 7.

    All nine symbols are now distinct and cover 1–9 exactly:

        & = 1,  $ = 5,  # = 3,  @ = 2,  ^ = 8,  % = 7,
        \ = 6,  ? = 4,  > = 9.

    Check every equation:

        6 + 9  = 15 ✔
        8 + 7  = 15 ✔

(If N is an integer then N^2 is a square and N^3 is a cube.)",Represent any such numbers as N^y where y is some positive real number,"599
The square of a square is (N^2)^2 = N^(2*2) = N^4.  The cube of a cube is (N^3)^3 = N^(3*3) = N^9.  The least common multiple between 4 and 9 is 36, so a number that is a square of a square and a cube of a cube is a number of the form N^36.
The 36th root of a googol is
(10^100)^(1/36) = 10^(100/36) = 10^(2.77777...) ~ 599.48

1.  “Square of a square”  ⇔  n = a^4 for some integer a,

2.  “Cube of a cube”      ⇔  n = b^9 for some integer b,  
    because (b^3)^3 = b^9.

Hence n is simultaneously a fourth power and a ninth power.  
Write the prime-factorisation of n:

 n = ∏ p_i^{e_i}.

•  Being a fourth power means each exponent e_i is divisible by 4.  
•  Being a ninth power means each exponent e_i is divisible by 9.  

Therefore every e_i is divisible by lcm(4, 9) = 36, so

 n = c^36 for some integer c.  

Conversely, every 36-th power is automatically both a 4-th power and a 9-th power.  
Thus the problem reduces to counting the 36-th powers below a googol.

We need all integers c such that

 c^36 < 10^100  
 ⇒ c < (10^100)^{1/36} = 10^{100/36} = 10^{25/9}.

Compute 10^{25/9}:

 10^{25/9} = 10^{2 + 7/9} = 10^2 · 10^{7/9}  
 10^{7/9} = 10^{0.777777…} ≈ 5.9943.

Hence 10^{25/9} ≈ 100 × 5.9943 ≈ 599.43.

Therefore c can be any integer from 1 up to 599 inclusive (600 would already exceed the bound).

90,What is the 1000th prime number?,It is smaller than 10000,7919,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To identify the 1000th prime, one can in principle:

1. Estimate roughly where the 1000th prime should lie.  
   • The Prime Number Theorem says π(x) ≈ x / ln x.

2. Generate all primes up to that bound.  
   • Use a sieve of Eratosthenes (or a simple incremental test) and count them.  
   • Continue until exactly 1000 primes are collected.

3. Verify the count.

Squares are congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4).

7^C (mod 4) = 3 if C is odd, 1 if C is even.

Hence  

3^A + 5^B + 7^C ≡ (3 or 1) + 1 + (3 or 1) (mod 4).

To get 0 or 1 (mod 4) we must have exactly one of the two terms 3^A , 7^C congruent to 3.  
Therefore one of A, C is odd and the other is even.

Step 2.  Look for the smallest possible value.

Can s=2? m would be 8, the maximum for l would be 7, and the maximum for x would be 6. For these maximum values, (5) says 135 = 186. The left side, which is at its maximum, is less than the right side, so s must be at least 3.
Can s=5? The least x can be is 6, and the minimum for l is 7. This minimum substituted into (5) gives 192 = 186. So 5 is too high to be s.
Now we know that s must be either 3 or 4. Let's set s equal to 3 for now, and see what happens.
Substituting into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 129, solved for l gives (6): l = (129 - 8x) / 7
We know x is at least 4, because s is 3. So let's try different values for x, starting at 4, and substitute into (6).
If x=4, then l=13 6/7, which is not a whole number, proving impossible.
If x=5, then l=12 5/7, also not a whole number. As x increases by 1, the remainder decreases by 1. So we have to increase x by 5 to get to a whole number l-value.
If x=10, then l = 7. Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.
This proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.
Substituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.
Now we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.

94,"Dear Jim:
Our twenty-fifth reunion went wonderfully last week.  The Math Department put on a great spread.  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.  I ran into Ralph Jones there - remember him?  It turns out he married Susie Jacobsen a couple of years after graduation - imagine that!  They have three kids, all boys, and their ages make a nice puzzle.  No two of them are the same age.  Right now, Albert's age is the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of his two brothers.  A year ago, Bill was in the same situation.  Finally, six years from now it will be Charles' turn to have an age equal to the sum of the digits of his brothers' ages.  I trust that's enough information to let you figure out their ages.
Give my regards to Sharon, and I hope I'll see you at our next reunion.
Jerry","Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)","Albert is 11, Bill is 6, and Charles is 5, 11 = 6+5.  A year ago, they were 10, 5, and 4, 1+0+4 = 5.  In six years, they will be 17, 12, and 11, 1+7+1+2=11.
You can solve this one by trial and error, but you can also solve simultaneous congruences mod 9.  Let a, b, and c represent the present ages of the three boys.  Since any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9, we have three congruences:
a = b + c (mod 9)
b-1 = (a-1) + (c-1) (mod 9)
c+6 = (a+6) + (b+6) (mod 9)
Substituting the value of a from the first congruence into the other two and simplifying, we get:
2c = 1 = 10 (mod 9), so c = 5 (mod 9), and
2b = -6 = 12 (mod 9), so b = 6 (mod 9),
so a = b + c = 2 (mod 9).
Age 2 is too young for Albert to be equal to the sum of digits of his brother's ages, and 20 is too old (it would require that both brothers be 19, contrary to the required congruences), so Albert must be 11, and the rest follows quickly.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

A = Albert’s present age  
B = Bill’s present age  
C = Charles’ present age  
S(n) = sum of the decimal digits of n  

The three statements in the letter translate into

(1)  A   = S(B) + S(C)                               (now)  
(2)  B–1 = S(A–1) + S(C–1)                           (a year ago)  
(3)  C+6 = S(A+6) + S(B+6)                           (six years hence)

Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because S(n) ≡ n (mod 9),

(1)  A ≡ B + C (mod 9)  
(2)  B ≡ A + C – 1 (mod 9)

Subtracting gives –2C ≡ 1 (mod 9), so C ≡ 5 (mod 9).

Step 2.  Bound the ages.  
Since S(B) ≤ 9 and S(C) ≤ 9, equation (1) gives A ≤ 18.  
Equation (3) gives C + 6 ≤ S(A+6)+S(B+6) ≤ 22, hence C ≤ 16.

Combining with C ≡ 5 (mod 9) leaves only two possibilities: C = 5 or C = 14.

Step 3.  Try C = 5.

Equation (1):          A = S(B) + 5.            (4)  
Equation (2):          B = S(A–1) + 5.          (5)  
Equation (3):          11 = S(A+6)+S(B+6).      (6)

Because S(B) ≤ 9, (4) forces 6 ≤ A ≤ 14.  Check each value:

A=6→B=10 gives S(12)+S(16)=10≠11  
A=7→B=11 gives S(13)+S(17)=12≠11  
A=8→B=12 gives S(14)+S(18)=14≠11  
A=9→B=13 gives S(15)+S(19)=16≠11  
A=10→B=14 gives S(16)+S(20)=9≠11  
A=11→B=6  gives S(17)+S(12)=8+3=11 ✔  
A=12→B=7  gives S(18)+S(13)=13≠11  
A=13→B=8  gives S(19)+S(14)=15≠11  
A=14→B=9  gives S(20)+S(15)=8≠11  

Only A = 11, B = 6, C = 5 satisfies all three equations.

Step 4.  Try C = 14.

Then C+6 = 20, so S(A+6)+S(B+6)=20.  Re-doing the same check (with A still 6–14) shows no solution at all.

Conclusion.  The unique set of ages is

Albert  = 11 years

95,"What three-digit number when doubled is, by value, one more than the value of the same three digits when reversed?
If this is too easy, go for extra points included with hint.","A wrongheaded guess would say 123, because 123 * 2 = 321 + 1.  The title hints you can easily go on to find for a ten-digit number that otherwise has same characteristics.","Answer-
397.
397 * 2 = 794 = 793 + 1.
Solution-
With lowercase letters standing for unknown digits, the problem is formulized as:
(100a + 10b + c) * 2 = (100c + 10b + a) + 1.
200a + 20b + 2c = a + 10b + 100c + 1.
199a + 10b - 98c - 1 = 0.
[The negative values achieve their negative extreme when c = 9. - 98c - 1 = -883.  This caps the value of a as the integral portion of 883/199, i.e., 4. This is in brackets, because there are stronger forces which make this unimportant.]
Rule 1)  No number starts with a 0.  [a is not 0.  c is not 0.]
Rule 2)  Because doubling a number starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will result in a product with an additional position/digit, a must be less than 5. [a is 1, 2, 3, or 4.]
Rule 3) When a digit is doubled, the most that can be ""carried"" to the next position is 1.  This happens when and only when the digit doubled is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Rule 4)  Any multiple of 2 will be an even number.  To differ from the doubled number by just 1, the reversed number must be odd and its last digit must be odd.  a must be an odd digit. [a is 1 or 3.]
Rule 5)  Doubling a three-digit number results in a number determined by the leading digit and limited to two hundred possibilities. (Doubling a number in the 100's has a result in the 200's or 300's. Doubling a number in the 400's has a result in the 800's or 900's.)[If a is 1, c is 2 or 3. If a is 3, c is 6 or 7.]
When the digits are reversed, b replaces b so it must either be b * 2 = b or, if Rule 3 comes into play, b * 2 = 10 + (b - 1).  [b could only be 0 when c < 5 and only 9 when c >4.]
With just four possibilities, there is no point in rendering additional rules! Just test them.

N = 100a + 10b + c,  

where a (the hundreds digit) is 1–9 and b, c are 0–9.

When the digits are reversed we get  

R = 100c + 10b + a.

The condition in the problem is  
2 N = R + 1.

Substitute the expressions:

2(100a + 10b + c) = 100c + 10b + a + 1  
200a + 20b + 2c = 100c + 10b + a + 1.

Collect like terms:

199a + 10b − 98c = 1.        (★)

Now enforce the digit restrictions.

1. Parity:  
10b and 98c are even, 1 is odd, so 199a must be odd → a is odd.  
Thus a ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.

2. Solve (★) for 10b:  
10b = 98c − 199a + 1.

The left–hand side is a multiple of 10 lying between 0 and 90 (because b is a single digit).  
So the right–hand side must be one of the values {0, 10, 20, …, 90}.

Check each allowed a:

a = 1: 10b = 98c − 198 → values −198, −100, −2, 96, …  (none 0–90)  
a = 3: 10b = 98c − 596.

 Try c = 7 → 10b = 98·7 − 596 = 686 − 596 = 90 → b = 9 (valid).  
 All other c give values outside 0–90.

a = 5, 7, 9: The expression 98c − 199a + 1 is always ≤ −112, so no solutions.

Hence the only digit triple satisfying (★) is (a, b, c) = (3, 9, 7).

Check:

N = 397  
2 N = 794  
reverse(397) = 793

Therefore the unique three-digit number with the stated property is 397.

96,"An iterative equation is one where an initial value is put into the equation to obtain a result, which is in turn put back into the equation as an input and the process is repeated for either a fixed number of times or until a final value is achieved (where you get the same number out as you put in).
For example, if you start with the iterative equation,
A{n+1} = 1/A{n} + 1
And you put in an initial value of 1, you would get 2 as the result.  Put the 2 back in as the input and you would get 1.5, and so on.
There is a simple iterative equation which, when repeated just five times, will give you a very good approximation of the square root of two (accurate to three decimal places, or less than 0.1%).

A(A+1) = A + 2
... A^2 + A = A + 2
... A^2 = 2

Write √2 in a slightly disguised way:

Let x = √2  
⇔ x² = 2  
⇔ x² – 1 = 1  
⇔ (x – 1)(x + 1) = 1  
⇔ x – 1 = 1 ⁄ (x + 1)  

Now isolate x on the left so that the right–hand side can be evaluated from the previous iterate:

x = 1 + 1 ⁄ (x + 1)

Thus, if we define the iteration

A₀  =  any real number except –1  
A_{n+1} = 1 + 1 ⁄ ( A_n + 1)          (∗)

then any starting value A₀ ≥ 0 (and all negative values except –1) is legitimate, because the denominator A_n + 1 never vanishes thereafter.

Convergence speed  
Take a few representative initial values:

A₀ = 0   → 2 → 1.333 … → 1.428 … → 1.411 … → 1.4140  
A₀ = 1   → 1.5 → 1.4 → 1.416 … → 1.413 … → 1.4140  
A₀ = 10  → 1.0909 → 1.478 … → 1.403 … → 1.4159 → 1.4137  

In every case, after at most five iterations the value is 1.414 ± 0.0003, i.e. correct to three decimal places (better than 0.1 %).

Why it works  
If L is a fixed point of (∗) then

L = 1 + 1⁄(L + 1)  ⇒  (L – 1)(L + 1) = 1  ⇒  L² = 2,

so the only positive fixed point is L = √2.  
The derivative of the right-hand side at L is |d/dx [1 + 1⁄(x + 1)]_{x=L}| = | –1/(L + 1)² | = 1⁄(√2 + 1)² ≈ 0.171 < 1, hence √2 is an attractive fixed point and the iteration converges rapidly.

The digit-sum is S = 3 n₃ + 7 n₇.

Step 2.  Make the digit-sum divisible by 21  
S must be divisible by both 3 and 7, hence by 21.

•  Mod 3: 3 n₃ ≡ 0, 7 n₇ ≡ n₇ (mod 3)  
 So S ≡ n₇ (mod 3). To have S ≡ 0, we need n₇ ≡ 0 (mod 3).

•  Mod 7: 3 n₃ ≡ 3 n₃, 7 n₇ ≡ 0 (mod 7)

Therefore  
 n₃ = 7a, n₇ = 3b for non-negative integers a, b.

The length is L = n₃ + n₇ = 7a + 3b.

Step 4.  Verify divisibility of 777  
Digit-sum: 7 + 7 + 7 = 21, divisible by 3 and 7.  
Number itself: 777 = 7 × 111 = 21 × 37, so divisible by both 3 and 7.

Locker k is toggled once for every positive integer n that divides k, because on pass n we touch every nth locker.

Subsequent passes keep toggling it.  
A locker ends up open exactly when it is toggled an odd number of times overall, because its state alternates between closed and open with each toggle.

Which integers k have an odd number of divisors?  
An integer normally has its divisors in complementary pairs (d, k/d).

A move consists of choosing 93 coins and toggling them, i.e. adding (mod 2) a
vector that has 1’s in those 93 positions and 0’s in the other 7.

1.  Re-write a “93–flip’’ as a “7–flip’’  
   Flipping the 93 coins in the set S is the same as
   (i) flipping every coin, and then  
   (ii) flipping the 7 coins in the complementary set S̄.
   Hence the move–vector vS equals  
        vS = (1,1,…,1) + wS̄,  
   where wS̄ has 1’s in the 7 positions of S̄ and 0’s elsewhere.

   Thus every move can be viewed as the sum of the all-1 vector 𝟙
   and a “7–vector’’ (weight 7).

2.  The parity condition  
   After k moves the total added vector is
        k 𝟙 + (w1 + w2 + … + wk)   (mod 2).               (∗)

   We start from 𝟙 (all heads) and want to finish at 0 (all tails), so (∗)
   has to equal 𝟙.  Hence

        If k is even :    w1 + … + wk = 𝟙.                  (1)

3.  No odd k works  
   Each wi has weight 7, so the left side of (1) has weight 7k.
   If k is odd the right side is 0, forcing every coordinate of the sum to be
   even.  Then 7k is even, impossible because 7 is odd.  Therefore k must be
   even.

4.  A lower bound for even k  
   Suppose k is even.  In (1) every coin must appear an odd number of times in
   the 7-vectors wi.  Let xi be the (odd) number of times coin i occurs.
   Then

        x1 + x2 + … + x100 = 7k.                          (2)

   All xi are positive odd integers, so the left side is at least 100.
   Hence 7k ≥ 100 ⇒ k ≥ 15; but k must be even, so k ≥ 16.        (3)

   Thus at least 16 moves are necessary.

   Each of the first 94 coins appears exactly once; each of 95–100 appears
   three times.  Therefore every coin is flipped an odd number of times,
   satisfying (1) with k = 16.

   Perform the 16 moves whose complements are S1,…,S16

So N + 1 is simultaneously divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  
Hence N + 1 must be a multiple of the least common multiple of these numbers.

Compute L = lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).

2^3 (from 8), 3^2 (from 9), 5, 7 ⇒ L = 2^3·3^2·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 2520.

Thus N + 1 = 2520 k for some positive integer k, so

N = 2520 k − 1.

Each year, the birth rate is 4% of the population at the beginning of the year, and the death rate is 3% of the population at the beginning of the year.  The resulting births and deaths are truncated to a whole number.  These rates are constant.  For example, consider a population of 99 people at the start of a year.  A 4% birth rate would be 3.96, truncated to 3 births during the year.  A 3% death rate would be 2.97, truncated to 2 deaths during the year.

2) Beginning with the 26th year, the number of births per year will increase to 5 (4% of 125 = 5), while the deaths will still be 3.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 135 at the end of the 30th year.
3) Beginning with the 31st year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 4 (3% of 135 = 4.05), while the births will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 150 at the end of the 45th year.
4) Beginning with the 46th year, the number of births per year will increase to 6 (4% of 150 = 6), while the deaths will still be 4.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 168 at the end of the 54th year.
5) Beginning with the 55th year, the number of deaths per year will increase to 5 (3% of 168 = 5.04), while the births will still be 6.  The population will increase at the rate of 1 per year, reaching 175 at the end of the 61st year.
6) Beginning with the 62nd year, the number of births per year will increase to 7 (4% of 175 = 7), while the deaths will still be 5.  The population will increase at the rate of 2 per year, reaching 201 at the end of the 75th year.

1.  Find all populations that give Δ(P)=1.

• 167–174: each year adds 1 (7 years).  
 Start of year 55 with 168, …, start of year 61 with 174, increase by 1 to 175.

Thus year 61 (the year that begins with population 174) is the last year in which the net increase is only 1.  From year 62 onward the increase is at least 2.

""You know what occurred to me the other day, Cal?"" asked Professor Gebra.

104,"Kurt & Rod were hanging around the window at school munching the last of their Rnkfurers hoard.  They spotted their neighbor lounging in the enclosed courtyard, looking hungry.
""Patty O'Furniture!  Good to see you!  Want a Rnkfurter?""
""A what?""
Kurt handed her the last he had.  She bit in, and her face lit up like a newly-coined metaphor.
""Where can I get more of these?""
""Rod and I were about to go order some more.  But there's a catch: we always order so one of us gets the quantity that the other has for a percentage.""  Patty's blank look bade him explain.  ""In our first batch, we got a total of 25 -- 20 for me, and 5 for Rod.  I had 20, and he had 20% of the total.""
""And you think you can do that for three people?  You get my percentage, and I get Rod's?  I don't think we can do it.""
Rod had been thinking about it, and rattled off three numbers to her.
""Those aren't right.  The last one isn't the right percentage; there's an added fraction.""
""So?  My mom says they're the same on her old phonograph speeds.""
Patty looked at Kurt, each waiting for the other to give an opinion.  Finally, she gestured at the empty wrapper in his hand.
""I'll round off a little for a week's supply of these.  Let's go!""
Since Rnkfurters come in cases of 25, 50, and 100, they had to leave 10 with the storekeeper to make the numbers work, but they got their munchies.
How many did each student get this time?","The old phonograph speeds were typically 16, 33-1/3, 45, and 78 RPM.","27 for Kurt, 30 for Patty, and 33 for Rod.
That's 30% for Kurt and 33-1/3% for Patty.
Method:
Let K, P, and R stand for the quantity each of them had.  Let T be the total, K+P+R.
Now, since Kurt's percentage equals Patty's quantity, we get
100*K/T = P.
Similarly,
100*P/T = R plus a fraction.  Now, look at the common factor, 100/T.  Let's call this F, the factor relating one quantity to the next.
K*F = P and P*F = R (plus a fraction),
and K*F^2 = R (plus a fraction).
The clue about the phonograph leaves us looking for a triple with 33 Rnkfurters for Rod, with Patty getting 33-1/3% (one-third) of the total.
P = T/3
P = (K+P+33)/3 -- remember, R=33
Now, combine this with 100*K/T = P, and a bit of algebra gives us the required answer.
-------------
Alternately, there are 11 triples that fit the factor requirement (courtesy of a short computer program), ranging from (19, 25, 32) to (2376, 96, 3).  The ones that total 10 less than a multiple of 25 are
27, 30, 33
63, 45, 32
891, 90, 9
Given the phonograph clue, I expect you can recognize that the first triple above is the answer.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 K = number Kurt gets  
 R = number Rod gets  
 P = number Patty gets  
 T = K + R + P = total number they take with them  

Desired “percentage” conditions  
(what Patty was objecting to) were

 (1) Patty’s number must equal Rod’s percentage of the total  
   P = 100·R / T  
 (2) Kurt’s number must equal Patty’s percentage of the total  
   K = 100·P / T  

Rod tried to satisfy these exactly, but Patty noticed that
the second percentage would have to be “33⅓”, containing an
extra fraction.  Rod answered that his mother’s phonograph
doesn’t care about the “⅓”, so they finally agreed to
drop the fraction and use the integer part of every
percentage (i.e. take the percentage, then truncate any
fractional part).

So we want integers K, P, R, T with

  P = ⎣100·R / T⎦             (percentage of Rod, truncated)  
  K = ⎣100·P / T⎦             (percentage of Patty, truncated)  

and of course K + P + R = T.

Trying totals they could actually carry home, i.e. a number
that is 10 less than a whole case (cases are 25, 50, 100):

 T = 25 − 10 = 15      too small  
 T = 50 − 10 = 40      no solution  
 T = 75 − 10 = 65      no solution  
 T = 100 − 10 = 90   ← works!  

With T = 90 the truncation factor is 100/90 = 10/9 ≃ 1.111…

Start with Rod’s amount R.  
Because P = ⎣(10/9) R⎦, chose R so that P itself
is a multiple of 3 (to give a whole number after the next
step).  The smallest such R that keeps T = 90 turns out to be
R = 27 :

 P = ⎣(10/9) · 27⎦ = ⎣30⎦ = 30  
 K = ⎣(10/9) · 30⎦ = ⎣33. 3…⎦ = 33  

Check the total: 27 + 30 + 33 = 90 ✅

Now Patty’s percentage of the total is exactly
30/90 = 33⅓ %, and Rod’s percentage is 27/90 = 30 %.
Their truncated values (33 and 30) are precisely Kurt’s
and Patty’s counts, satisfying the agreed-on rule once the
fraction is ignored.

They therefore ordered a 100-frank case, left 10 with the
storekeeper, and went away with 90 franks divided:

 Kurt  33  
 Patty 30  
 Rod   27  

Final answer: Kurt got 33, Patty got 30, and Rod got 27.",True
105,"A man is standing on a rock in the middle of a circular lake of radius 1. There is a tiger on the shore of the lake that can run four times as fast you can swim, however the tiger cannot swim. The tiger is hungry and always attempts to keep the distance between the two of you at a minimum. How can you safely swim to shore?
Assume that as long as you can get to the shore before the tiger gets to you (even if it is only a split-second before), you will be safe.",Use the factor of 4 to your advantage,"Until you are more than 1/4 of the radius away from the rock you can swim fast enough so that you can keep the tiger the furthest distance possible from you. Regardless of which direction the tiger moves around the circle, you swim the other way, always keeping the rock between you and the tiger.  While you are doing this you will be able to move outward, since you will have some energy to spare.
Before long you will be 1/4 of the radius away from the center and the tiger will be 180 degrees away. At this point swim straight to the point on the shore furthest from the tiger. You will be able to get there in 3/4 units of time, while it will take the tiger pi/4 =~ 0.7854 units of time.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let v be your swimming speed.  
The tiger’s running speed is 4 v.

1. Get inside the “fast circle”.  
   While you are at a distance r from the centre, your angular speed around the centre is  
        ω₁ = v / r.  
   The tiger, running on the shore (radius = 1), has angular speed  
        ω₂ = 4 v / 1 = 4 v.  
   If ω₁ > ω₂ you can turn round the centre faster than the tiger can turn on the bank, so you can make the tiger lag in angle.  
   ω₁ > ω₂  ⇔  v / r > 4 v  ⇔  r < ¼.  

   Therefore, as long as you stay inside the circle of radius ¼ you can always increase or decrease the angular gap at will.

2. Establish the diametrically-opposite position.  
   Swim on a small circle of some radius r with r < ¼ (say r = 0.23).  
   Because you turn faster than the tiger, keep swimming round until the tiger is exactly opposite you— i.e. the line through you and the centre points to a spot on the shore that is 180° away from the tiger.

3. Dash for shore.  
   The distance you must still swim is 1 – r.  
   The tiger, starting exactly opposite your target point, has to run half the circumference of the lake, a distance π.

   Times needed:  
        Your time T₁ = (1 – r)/v  
        Tiger’s time T₂ = π/(4v)

   You reach shore first provided  
        (1 – r)/v < π/(4v)  ⇔  1 – r < π/4.

   π/4 ≈ 0.7854, so 1 – r must be less than 0.7854, i.e. r > 1 – π/4 ≈ 0.2146.  
   Pick any radius between 0.2146 and 0.25 (for instance r = 0.23 used above); then

        T₁ = 0.77/v < T₂ = 0.785/v.

   You reach the shore a split-second before the tiger arrives and are safe.

4. Why the tiger cannot do better.  
   While you are inside the ¼-radius circle you can always increase the angular gap faster than the tiger can close it, so the tiger cannot leave the diametrically opposite point without giving you a still larger head start. Hence the above dash really is the tiger’s best-case race, and you win it.

Thus, by staying inside radius ¼ until the tiger is opposite and then swimming straight out from any radius r with  
 1 – π/4 < r < ¼,  
you are guaranteed to reach shore before the tiger.

Final answer: Swim in a small circle of radius less than ¼ until the tiger is diametrically opposite, then from any radius slightly above 0.2146 (e.g. 0.23) head straight for the shore; you arrive first and escape.",True

1. From N₉ = ⁹⁄₁₀ N₈ ⇒ N₈ = 10/9 N₉ → need 9 | N₉.

2. From N₈ = ⁸⁄₉ N₇ ⇒ N₇ = 9/8 N₈ = 5/4 N₉ → need 4 | N₉.

3. From N₇ = ⁷⁄₈ N₆ ⇒ N₆ = 8/7 N₇ = 10/7 N₉ → need 7 | N₉.

4. From N₆ = ⁶⁄₇ N₅ ⇒ N₅ = 7/6 N₆ = 5/3 N₉ → need 3 | N₉ (already implied by 9 | N₉).

5. From N₅ = ⁵⁄₆ N₄ ⇒ N₄ = 6/5 N₅ = 2 N₉ (automatic integer).

6. From N₄ = ⁴⁄₅ N₃ ⇒ N₃ = 5/4 N₄ = 5/2 N₉ → need 2 | N₉ (already implied by 4 | N₉).

7. From N₃ = ¾ N₂ ⇒ N₂ = 4/3 N₃ = 10/3 N₉ (3 | N₉ already holds).

8. From N₂ = ⅔ N₁ ⇒ N₁ = 3/2 N₂ = 5 N₉ (always integer).

9. From N₁ = ½ N₀ ⇒ N₀ = 2 N₁ = 10 N₉ (always integer).

Therefore N₉ must be divisible by 9, 4, and 7, i.e. by lcm(9,4,7) = 252.
The smallest positive integer with that property is 252.

Hence the smallest possible number of marbles left in Justin’s bag is 252.

107,"Arrogant Arnold and Witty Will are brothers. One day, they were going from New Jersey to Florida. Bored, they decided to ask each other brain teasers. After a while, they got bored with this, so Arnold decided to place a bet. He would ask Will one teaser, which he thought was very hard. If Will got it right, Arnold would clean his room for the rest of the year. However, if Will got it WRONG, he would have to clean Arnold's room for a year and do his dishes for a month. After thinking for a while, Will agreed to this. This was Arnold's teaser:
Use each digit 1-9 only once each, so that one number multiplied by another equals the third. One example is 12*483=5796. Name at least one more!!!
Being witty as his name suggests, Will easily answered this. The question is, can you find one?","1) They can't be -12*483=-5796, 1.2*48.3=57.96, etc.

A (with a₁ digits) and B (with b₁ digits)  
and let their product be C (with c₁ digits).  
Because the nine different digits 1-9 must be used once altogether, we need  

a₁ + b₁ + c₁ = 9.

Since the product of two positive integers below 10 000 is at most 4 digits, the only feasible partitions are  
1 × 4 = 4 or 2 × 3 = 4 (or the symmetric 3 × 2 = 4, 4 × 1 = 4).

I will look at the 2-digit × 3-digit = 4-digit pattern (the same pattern as the example 12 × 483 = 5796).

1.  A digital-sum (mod 9) condition  
   The nine digits 1+2+…+9 sum to 45, which is 0 (mod 9).  
   If x ≡ A (mod 9) and y ≡ B (mod 9), then the product satisfies

        A·B ≡ x y (mod 9) and  
        A + B + A·B ≡ 0 (mod 9).

   Hence x y + x + y ≡ 0 (mod 9), i.e.  
        (x+1)(y+1) ≡ 1 (mod 9).

   Working in ℤ₉ the units and their inverses are

        1↔1, 2↔5, 4↔7, 5↔2, 7↔4, 8↔8.

   So the possible residue pairs (x, y) are  
        (0,0), (1,4), (3,6), (4,1), (6,3), (7,7).

2.  Pick one feasible pair and search.

   Take the pair (x, y) = (3, 6); that means  
        the 2-digit factor must be ≡ 3 (mod 9) and  
        the 3-digit factor must be ≡ 6 (mod 9).

   The smallest 2-digit numbers with distinct digits and residue 3 are 12, 21, 39, 48, 57, 66 (66 repeats a digit, so discard it), etc.  
   Try 39.

   Multiplying 39 by the smallest 3-digit multiples of 9 that are ≡ 6 (mod 9) and have distinct digits:

        39 × 186 = 7254.

   Check the digits:

        39 → 3, 9  
        186 → 1, 8, 6  
        7254 → 7, 2, 5, 4  

   Combined we get exactly the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with no repetition.

Therefore 39 × 186 = 7254 is a valid “once-each-digit” multiplication.

108,"In the equation FORTY+TEN+TEN=SIXTY, each letter represents a different digit. Can you figure out which letter is which digit?",Start from the last digits.,"First, there are ten different letters in this equation: E, F, I, N, O, R, S, T, X, Y. Therefore, every digit from 0 to 9 is used.
Because the last two digits of TY+EN*2 is TY, EN*2 is divisible by 100, EN must equal 50.
We get FOR+T*2+1=SIX.
Since T*2+1<20, SI is at most FO+2. We must have S=F+1, and since the digit 0 is occupied by N, O must equal 9 and I must equal 1. Hence SI=FO+2.
We get R+T*2+1=20+X, or R=X+(19-T*2). The remaining digits are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
If T=6, Then R=X+7, which is impossible for these numbers. And T can't be lower.
If T=7, then R=X+5, and we can only have R=8, X=3. This leaves 2, 4, 6, from which we can't choose S=F+1.
If T=8, then R=X+3, we can have R=6, X=3, or R=7, X=4.
If R=6, X=3, the remaining digits are 2, 4, 7, and again we can't choose S=F+1.
If R=7, X=4, the remaining digits are 2, 3, 6, where 3=2+1. Hence S=3, F=2.
Finally, the remaining digit 6 is for Y.
Therefore, the equation is 29786+850+850=31486.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Work the addition column by column.

1. Units: Y + N + N = Y  ⇒  2N must be a multiple of 10.  
   Distinct digits give N = 0 (carry c₁ = 0).

2. Tens: T + E + E + c₁ = T.  
   With c₁ = 0 we need 2E = 10, so E = 5 and the carry to the next column is c₂ = 1.

3. Hundreds: R + T + T + c₂ = X (mod 10) with carry c₃.  
   Hence R + 2T + 1 = X + 10c₃.

4. Thousands: O + c₃ = I (mod 10) with carry c₄.

5. Ten-thousands: F + c₄ = S (no further carry).

Because S ≠ F, c₄ must be 1.  
Then c₃ must be 2 (otherwise c₄ would be 0).  
Thus O + 2 ≥ 10, giving O = 9 and I = 1.

With c₃ = 2:  R + 2T + 1 = X + 20  ⇒  X = R + 2T – 19.

Trying digits (all distinct, 0 and 5 already used, O = 9, I = 1):

T = 8 gives 2T = 16.

111,"Mad Ade was visiting his friend, computer tycoon and Olympic Kebab hurling champion, Mike Rohsopht.
He was there on Sunday and when the radio gave the time at the hour, Mad Ade noticed that the Madadian antique clock, designed by Madadian clock maker Arthur Minit (teaser #4891) was exactly 3 minutes slow.
""It loses 7 minutes every hour,"" said Mad Ade's friend. ""No more and no less, but I've gotten used to it that way.""
When Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht later that same month, he remarked on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Mike assured Mad Ade that his treasured Arthur Minit clock had not been adjusted nor fixed since his last visit.
What day of the week was Mad Ade's second visit?",It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total,"The answer is 17 days and 3 hours later, which would have been a Wednesday.
This is the only other time in the same month when the two would agree at all.
In 17 days the slow clock loses 17*24*7 minutes = 2856 minutes, or 47 hours and 36 minutes.  In 3 hours more it loses 21 minutes, so it has lost a total of 47 hours and 57 minutes.  Modulo 12 hours, it has ""gained"" 3 minutes so as to make up the 3 minutes it was slow on Sunday.  It is now (fortnight plus 3 days) exactly accurate.
Since the clock was not adjusted since the last visit, it's also possible that the radio time shifted by one hour due to a change to or from summer daylight saving time.  However, it turns out that the only additional possibilities that need to be considered are those of 4 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 12 hours 57 minutes, and 29 days 15 hours later, when the clock would have lost 3 days 10 hours 57 minutes.  Without even considering the rules for when in the month the
clock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (""Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht"") and they involve times in a different part of the day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

D(t) = (clock-time) − (true time)  (measured in minutes; negative means the clock is slow).  

1.  First visit

2.  Behaviour of the clock  
   It loses 7 minutes every true hour ⇒  
   after h true hours D = −3 − 7h.

3.  When will the clock read exactly the same hour and minute as the radio?  
   For an ordinary 12-hour dial the clock is “dead right’’ whenever D is a multiple of 12 hours = 720 minutes.  
   Hence we want  
      −3 − 7h ≡ 0  (mod 720).  
   ⇔ 7h ≡ 717   (mod 720).

   Because gcd(7,720)=1 an inverse of 7 (mod 720) is 103, since 7·103 = 721 ≡ 1.  
   Multiplying by 103 gives  

      h ≡ 103·717 ≡ 411  (mod 720).

   The smallest positive solution is  
      h = 411 hours.

4.  How long is 411 hours?  
      411 ÷ 24 = 17 remainder 3,   
   so it is 17 days and 3 hours.

5.  Day of the second visit  
   14 days after Sunday is another Sunday; 3 more days take us to Wednesday, and the extra 3 hours can easily make it “rather late in the evening”.  

Therefore Mad Ade’s second visit must have been on a Wednesday.

Solving for x:
x= 42.985 degrees",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

Th = 105 °F  (temperature of the hot supply)  
Tc = 45 °F   (temperature of the cold supply)

Let the volumetric flow rates be  

H = flow of hot water (faucet is wide-open, so H is fixed)  
C(θ) = flow of cold water when the cold handle is opened through an angle θ, 0 ° ≤ θ ≤ 360 °.

Assumptions (standard for this type of problem)  
1. Turning a handle changes the flow rate linearly with the angle turned.  
2. The two faucets, when fully opened, deliver the same maximum flow rate.  

Hence
• H can be taken as 1 unit (any constant would cancel out).  
• C(θ) = (θ / 360°)·1 = θ/360 (because 0° gives no cold flow and 360° gives the same full flow as the hot side).

The mixed temperature T is the flow-rate-weighted average:

T(θ) = (H·Th + C(θ)·Tc) / (H + C(θ))
      = (105·1 + (θ/360)·45) / (1 + θ/360).

We want T(θ) = 98.6 °F.  Solve for θ.

(105 + 45·θ/360) / (1 + θ/360) = 98.6

Multiply numerator and denominator by 360 to clear fractions:

(105·360 + 45θ) / (360 + θ) = 98.6

105·360 + 45θ = 98.6(360 + θ)  
37 800 + 45θ = 35 496 + 98.6θ

Bring like terms together:

37 800 − 35 496 = 98.6θ − 45θ

θ = 2 304 / 53.6 ≈ 42.98°.

1. it is abundant – the sum σ(n) of all its proper divisors exceeds n;  
2. it is not semiperfect – no sub-collection of those proper divisors has sum exactly n.

Step 1 – list the abundant numbers below 70  
For every integer m < 70 compute the sum of its proper divisors.  (Only those whose sum already exceeds the number itself can even be candidates.)

The abundant numbers below 70 are  
12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66.

Step 2 – show each of those is semiperfect  
For every one of the numbers in the list we can explicitly exhibit a subset of its proper divisors whose total equals the number:

12 : 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12  
18 : 9 + 6 + 3 = 18  
20 : 10 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20

60 : 30 + 20 + 10 = 60  
66 : 33 + 22 + 11 = 66

Hence every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect, so none of them is weird.

Step 3 – examine 70 itself  
Proper divisors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35  
Sum = 1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74 > 70, so 70 is abundant.

Now check every way of adding those divisors: no subset sums to 70.  (A quick systematic search or a computer check shows the largest subset sum not exceeding 70 is 69 = 35 + 14 + 10 + 7 + 2 + 1.)

Therefore 70 is abundant and not semiperfect – it is weird.

Since every abundant number below 70 is semiperfect, none is weird, so 70 is the first example.

The number of additional pieces formed on cut x will always be x. The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.
Finally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think about making the cuts one after another and try to maximise how many new pieces the next cut can create.

1. Start with no cuts.  
   • Pieces = 1.

2. When you draw the 1st cut, it obviously splits the pizza into 2 pieces.  
   • Added pieces = 1.

3. Draw the 2nd cut so that it crosses the 1st cut inside the pizza (not at the rim).  
   • Intersections with earlier cuts = 1.  
   • A straight line whose segment inside the circle is hit by k interior intersection points divides k + 1 existing pieces along its length, so it adds k + 1 new pieces.  
   • Added pieces = 1 + 1 = 2.  
   • Total pieces so far = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

4. Draw the 3rd cut so that it crosses both previous cuts in two different interior points and is not concurrent with their intersection.  
   • Intersections with earlier cuts = 2.  
   • Added pieces = 2 + 1 = 3.  
   • Total pieces so far = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7.

Observe the pattern: if every new cut meets all earlier cuts in different interior points and no three lines meet at one interior point, then

   • the k-th cut (k ≥ 1) meets k − 1 earlier cuts,  
   • so it adds (k − 1) + 1 = k new pieces.

Hence, with n cuts,

Pieces(n) = 1 + (1 + 2 + 3 + … + n)
           = 1 + n(n + 1)/2
           = (n² + n + 2)/2.

This upper bound can always be achieved by choosing each cut so that

• it is not parallel to any previous cut,  
• it does not pass through any previous interior intersection point,  
• it intersects the circle, not just touching the rim.

Therefore the largest possible number of pieces obtained with n straight cuts is

One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle. This triangle shares the dimensions of the cone, so it is 12 by 5. We are given that the diameter of the cylinder is congruent to the height, so we can deduce that the radius is half the length of the height. Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x. Thus, we can set up a proportion: 12/5 = 12-2x/x.
Next we can cross-multiply to get 12x=60-10x. If we add 10x on both sides, we get 22x=60, and dividing 22 from both sides yields x=60/22=30/11.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the cone’s axis be the y–axis, with

The cylinder is situated with the same axis (the y–axis).

Because the cylinder stands on the cone’s base, its bottom base is at y = 0 and its top base is at y = h.

             CD   = 10c + d           (last two digits)

Required property:  AB + CD = BC.

Translate to digits:

      (10a + b) + (10c + d) = 10b + c

The digits are now ?8?254963.  The remaining digits, 1 and 7, can be placed into either remaining location.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in full:

1. Let the 9-digit number be ABCDEFGHI (each letter is one of the digits 1–9, no repetition).

2. From DE divisible by 5 we get E = 5 (0 is unavailable).

3. The four even digits 2, 4, 6, 8 must occupy the four even-required positions B, D, F, H because:
   • AB divisible by 2 → B even  
   • CD divisible by 4 → D even  
   • EF divisible by 6 → F even  
   • GH divisible by 8 → H even

4. EF divisible by 6 means 50+F is divisible by 3.  
   50 ≡ 2 (mod 3), so F must satisfy F ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
   Among the even digits only 4 satisfies this, hence F = 4.

5. Now B, D, H are the remaining evens {2,6,8}.

6. FG divisible by 7.  F=4, so FG = 40+G.  
   40+G is a multiple of 7 only when G=9 (gives 49).  
   Thus G = 9.

7. GH divisible by 8.  G=9 ⇒ GH = 90+H.  
   90 ≡ 2 (mod 8); we need 2+H ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ H ≡ 6 (mod 8).  
   Hence H = 6.

8. HI divisible by 9.  H=6 ⇒ 60+I multiple of 9.  
   60 ≡ 6 (mod 9); so 6+I ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ I = 3.

9. Unused digits are {1,2,7,8}.  Remember B, D are even {2,8}; A, C are the two odds {1,7}.

10. BC must be divisible by 3, i.e. (B+C) divisible by 3 (because 10B+C ≡ B+C mod 3).

11. Try B=2: then C must give 2+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ C≡1 (mod 3).  
    Both 1 and 7 qualify, but CD must be divisible by 4:

        • C=1 ⇒ D=8 ⇒ CD=18 (not ÷4)  
        • C=7 ⇒ D=8 ⇒ CD=78 (not ÷4)

    So B cannot be 2.

12. Therefore B = 8, D = 2.

13. With B=8: need 8+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ C≡1 (mod 3).  Both 1 and 7 work:

        • C=1, D=2 → CD=12 (÷4) → A is then 7.
        • C=7, D=2 → CD=72 (÷4) → A is then 1.

14. Thus two complete numbers emerge:

        A B C D E F G H I
        7 8 1 2 5 4 9 6 3  → 781254963
        1 8 7 2 5 4 9 6 3  → 187254963

15. Final check (both numbers):
        AB ÷2, BC ÷3, CD ÷4, DE ÷5, EF ÷6, FG ÷7,
        GH ÷8, HI ÷9 – all conditions hold.

In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.
In a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).  How many different ways can a 13-card alternating-colour straight be formed from a Snapoker deck?  Note that jokers can not be used in forming a straight.",Simply find the number of cards of each type of card in the alternating-colors straight,"There are 32,768 possible ways a 13-card alternating-colour straight can be formed in a Snapoker deck.
To form a 13-card alternating-colour straight in Snapoker the following cards can be used:
2 x red aces
4 x black twos
2 x red threes
2 x black fours
2 x red fives
2 x black sixes
2 x red sevens
2 x black eights
4 x red nines
2 x black tens
2 x red jacks
2 x black queens
2 x red kings
Therefore, there are 2x4x2x2x2x2x2x2x4x2x2x2x2 = 32,768 possible 13-card alternating-colour straights that can be formed.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – Work out which cards are actually in the two–deck Snapoker pack  

Spades (black): only the even ranks survive → 2,4,6,8,10,12  
Hearts (red): only the odd ranks survive → 1(A),3,5,7,9,11(J),13(K)  
Diamonds (red): only the non-prime ranks survive → 4,6,8,9,10,12  
Clubs (black): only the prime ranks survive → 2,3,5,7,11(J),13(K)  

Every surviving card occurs twice (there are two decks).  
Jokers exist but are not allowed in a straight.

Step 2 – What an “alternating-colours straight” must look like  

The straight must contain every rank from Ace (1) to King (13) exactly once and  
colours must alternate red–black–red–black … .  
This forces the odd ranks to be red and the even ranks to be black.

Step 3 – Count the available choices for each rank

Odd (red) ranks  
1 (A): only ♥A  → 2 copies  
3: only ♥3      → 2 copies  
5: only ♥5      → 2 copies  
7: only ♥7      → 2 copies  
9: ♥9 or ♦9     → 4 copies  
11 (J): only ♥J → 2 copies  
13 (K): only ♥K → 2 copies  

Even (black) ranks  
2: ♠2 or ♣2     → 4 copies  
4: only ♠4      → 2 copies  
6: only ♠6      → 2 copies  
8: only ♠8      → 2 copies  
10: only ♠10    → 2 copies  
12 (Q): only ♠Q → 2 copies  

Step 4 – Multiply

Odd ranks: 2·2·2·2·4·2·2 = 256  
Even ranks: 4·2·2·2·2·2   = 128  

Total number of different 13-card alternating-colour straights  
= 256 × 128 = 32 768.

into a 5-digit numerator N and a 5-digit denominator D such that N/D = 1/2, i.e. D = 2N.

1.  D contains a 9 but the original multiset has no 8.  
    Therefore 9 cannot be in N, for doubling 9 produces an 8 (“18”), which is impossible.  
    Hence 9 is in D and must have been produced by doubling a 4 with a carry-in of 1
    (because 2·4 + 1 = 9).  
    So the tens digit of N is 4, and the units digit of N must be 5 or 6 (the only choices
    that produce a carry into the tens place).

2.  Take units digit 5.  Then
        units of D = 2·5 = 10 → 0, carry 1.

3.  We already have

4.  The carry from the hundreds place lets the thousands digit of N be 1:

    Now D is …3 2 9 0 .

5.  No carry reaches the ten-thousands place, so pick the remaining 2 there:

If you imagine you are facing a globe head on, you have the north pole at the top of the globe and the south pole at the bottom. Imagine a ""west pole"" and ""east pole"" to the left and right of the globe.
If you are at the north pole and turn left, you will walk through the ""west pole"" (right and you go through the ""east pole"")
If you walk on an axis from the north pole towards the south pole and make a left or right turn you will always walk through these imaginary east and west poles. So in the question 17.345 kilometers is irrelevant, only the turn.
(It also doesn't matter where you start on the planet, the distance at the end will still be the same.)
47.124 is approximately 3/4 of the circumference of this planet, which will leave you directly on the imaginary east pole. The distance is now the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of side 10km.
Answer: root 200 or approximately 14km!
(If you got the distance as 15.7km - the distance you would have to walk back, then that's ok too!)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

R = 10 km   (radius of the planet)  
d₁ = 17.345 km  
d₂ = 47.124 km  

On a sphere a “straight” walk follows a great-circle, so every surface distance d corresponds to a central angle θ = d / R (in radians).

1. First leg  
   θ₁ = d₁ / R = 17.345 / 10 = 1.7345 rad ≈ 99.435°.  
   Start at the North Pole; walking south along a meridian through this angle puts you at  
   latitude ϕ₁ = 90° – 99.435° = –9.435° (9.435° south of the equator), longitude λ₁ = 0°.

2. Second leg  
   At that point you are heading due south; a 90° “left” turn means you now head due east.  
   A due-east initial heading from any point is perpendicular to the meridian and is again a great circle.  

   The second distance gives the central angle  
   θ₂ = d₂ / R = 47.124 / 10 = 4.7124 rad.  
   Note 4.712389… rad = 3π/2, so θ₂ differs from 3π/2 by only 1.1 × 10⁻⁵ rad.

   Spherical navigation formulas (start latitude ϕ₁, start longitude λ₁, distance θ₂, initial azimuth 90°) give

   sin ϕ₂ = sin ϕ₁ cos θ₂           (because cos 90° = 0)  
           = (–0.163857)·(1.101 × 10⁻⁵)  
           = –1.804 × 10⁻⁶,

   so ϕ₂ ≈ –1.804 × 10⁻⁶ rad ≈ –0.000103° (essentially on the equator).

   The longitude change is

   Δλ = atan2( sin θ₂ cos ϕ₁ , cos θ₂ )  
       ≈ atan2( –0.9999999999·0.986466 , 1.101 × 10⁻⁵ )  
       ≈ –π/2 + 1.084 × 10⁻⁵ rad.

   Hence λ₂ ≈ –90.00062° (≈ 90° W).

   The end point is therefore almost exactly on the equator 90° west of the prime meridian.

3. Distance from the start (the North Pole) to the end point  
   With start latitude 90° and end latitude ≈ 0°, longitude difference ≈ 90°, the central angle δ satisfies  
   cos δ = sin 90°·sin ϕ₂ + 0·… = sin ϕ₂ ≈ –1.804 × 10⁻⁶,  

   so   δ = arccos(–1.804 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ π/2 + 1.804 × 10⁻⁶ rad.

   Surface distance back to the ship:

   D = R·δ ≈ 10 km · (1.570796 rad + 1.804 × 10⁻⁶ rad)

It is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at those respective times.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Look for a relation between the time shown on the clock and the number of the painting.

1.  Work out the angles of the two hands at each given time.
   •  Hour-hand angle = 30° × H + 0.5° × M  
   •  Minute-hand angle = 6° × M  
      (H = hour, M = minutes)

2.  Compute the absolute difference Δ between the two angles.

3.  Subtract that difference from a full circle (360°):
      painting-number = 360° – Δ.

Check the three given times.

11 : 00  
   hour = 30·11 = 330°  
   minute = 0°  
   Δ = |330 – 0| = 330°  
   360 – Δ = 360 – 330 = 30  ⟹  “Number 30”

4 : 00  
   hour = 30·4 = 120°  
   minute = 0°  
   Δ = |120 – 0| = 120°  
   360 – Δ = 360 – 120 = 240  ⟹  “Number 240”

7 : 30  
   hour = 30·7 + 0.5·30 = 225°  
   minute = 6·30 = 180°  
   Δ = |225 – 180| = 45°  
   360 – Δ = 360 – 45 = 315  ⟹  “Number 315”

The rule matches all three examples.

Now apply it to 9 : 20.

9 : 20  
   hour = 30·9 + 0.5·20 = 270 + 10 = 280°  
   minute = 6·20 = 120°

   360 – Δ = 360 – 160 = 200

• The band is 3 in long at t = 0 and is stretched 3 in every minute, i.e. it lengthens at a constant rate 3 in/min.

• The spider walks 1 in/min with respect to the rubber itself.  

How fast does the spider advance with respect to the rod?  

While the spider is walking, the band is also being stretched.  
At an instant t the fraction of the band already covered is x/L.  
Because the stretching is uniform, every point of the band (including the spider’s position) is moving away from the rod at the relative rate (x/L)·(dL/dt).  

Hence  

 dx/dt = 1            (walking)

Solve the differential equation

This is a linear first-order ODE.

Multiply (1) by μ(t):

When does the spider reach the free end?  

It reaches the end when x(t) = L(t):

(1+t) ≠ 0, so divide both sides by (1+t):

• relative speed to a west-bound pedestrian = |v + 4| km/h

The number of pedestrians a cab meets per hour (and hence its chance to pick up a fare) is proportional to

Clue #4- ""The mystery number does not contain a 9.""179, 197, 379, 419, 479, 619, 719, and 971 all contain a 9.
After Clue #4, we have 7 possibilities: 137, 173, 317, 431, 613, 617, and 673.
Clue #5- ""If A, B, and C are re-arranged from greatest to least, a 3-digit prime number is formed."" With our 7 possibilities (137, 173, 317, 431, 613, 617, and 673) we arrange their digits from greatest to least getting 731, 731, 731, 431, 631, 761, and 763 respectively. Of these new 7 numbers, only 431 (from 431), 631 (from 613), and 761 (from 617) are prime.
After Clue #5, we have 3 possibilities: 431, 613, and 617.
Clue #6- ""If A, B, and C are re-arranged from least to greatest, a 3-digit prime number is formed."" With our 3 possibilities (431, 613, and 617), we arrange their digits from least to greatest to get 134, 136, and 167 respectively. 134 (from 431) and 136 (from 631) are non-prime. 167 (from 617) is prime.
After Clue #6, we have one possibility: 617.
617 is the mystery number.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We translate every sentence of the riddle into exact arithmetic conditions and then sift through them systematically.

1.  ABC is a 3-digit prime.  
   ⇒ A ≠ 0 and C ∈ {1,3,7} (only possible terminal digits for an odd 3-digit prime that is not 5 or 9).

2.  AB and BC are both 2-digit primes.  
   ⇒ B must be 1, 3 or 7 (units digit of a 2-digit prime other than 9).  
   ⇒ C must again be 1, 3 or 7, and C ≠ B.

3.  A, B, C are distinct and none is 9 (given directly).

4.  “Greatest-to-least” and “least-to-greatest’’ permutations are primes.  
   ⇒ The three distinct digits must still yield primes when read in ascending and descending order.

So we now list the few possibilities forced by AB and BC being prime.

Case B = 1  
   AB can be 31, 41, 61, 71.  
   BC can be 13 or 17 (C = 3 or 7).  
   Testing the four A–C pairs that keep all digits distinct:

   •  A=3, C=7  →  ABC = 317, but 731 (descending) = 17·43, not prime.  
   •  A=4, C=3  →  ABC = 413 = 7·59, not prime.  
   •  A=4, C=7  →  ABC = 417 divisible by 3.  
   •  A=6, C=3  →  ABC = 613; ascending 136 is even → not prime.  
   •  A=6, C=7  →  ABC = 617; ascending 167 prime, descending 761 prime.  ✔

Case B = 3  
   BC prime forces C = 1 or 7 (31 or 37).  
   Parallel checking of all allowed A (so that AB is prime) kills every possibility: one of ABC,  the ascending, or descending permutation always fails to be prime.

Case B = 7  
   BC prime forces C = 1 or 3 (71 or 73).  
   Running through A = 1,3,4,6 (giving AB = 17,37,47,67) again knocks out every candidate except none passes all prime tests.

The only survivor of all six clues is therefore

617.

136,"Ranger Cadet Bu Star has just been given the task of moving the five cases of Park Pop soda at the Weiss Pavilion to the Wirth Pavilion, which is 5 miles away. For transportation, Bu must use a MoJoPed, a moped which runs on Park Pop. It can carry, at most, its rider and 25 bottles of soda, i.e., one case in its cargo carrier and one bottle in its fuel tank. It gets one mile to the bottle and is currently empty; it will only move under Pop power. How many unopened bottles can Bu deliver to the second pavilion?
Comments to triflers:
The bottles and cases are hi-tech, so there are no concerns about theft or littering. They can stay parked or be discarded anywhere. Yes, the constant rate of fuel use is unreal, and yes, of course, I am asking for the maximum number of bottles!",There are hints in the comments to triflers and in the title.,"80
To achieve this surprising result, Bu must first take the five cases, one at a time, and park them at a point along the route 2 5/18 miles from the Weiss Pavilion. This takes 9 trips of 2 5/18 miles (5 advancing trips interspersed with 4 return trips) for a total of 20.5 miles traveled (9 * 2 5/18 = 20.5) and 20.5 bottles of soda used. Cadet Star now has 99.5 bottles of soda. (5 * 24 - 20.5 = 120 - 20.5 = 99.5) He puts 3.5 of these aside and redistributes the other 96 to completely fill four cases. With one less case to move, Bu will now make 2 fewer trips. The 3.5 bottles set aside are used to move the four cases the next 1/2 mile toward the Wirth Pavilion.   After this, the Wirth Pavilion is just 2 2/9 miles away ( 5 - 2 5/18 - 9/18 = 2 4/18 ). Next, he travels 15 5/9 miles (7 * 2 2/9) using 15 5/9 bottles of soda to complete his trip. The ranger cadet delivers 80 bottles to the pavilion and has 4/9 of a Park Pop to spare. (96 - 15 5/9 = 80 4/9)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-1  ‑  useful figures  
• one case  = 24 bottles, total supply = 5·24 = 120 bottles  
• the MoJoPed can have at most 25 bottles aboard at one time:  
  24 (in the rack) + 1 (in the tank, which is drunk during that mile).  
• every mile travelled empties exactly one bottle.

Step-2  –  what one round-trip across a single mile costs  
Load 24 unopened bottles + 1 bottle for fuel, drive one mile forward.
At the new point the 24 unopened bottles are unloaded.  
Pick one of them, pour it into the tank and drive back.  

Result of that round-trip  
 unopened bottles transferred forward : 24 – 1 = 23  
 bottles drunk / lost        : 2  

So each complete “there-and-back” costs 2 bottles and nets 23
unopened bottles one mile forward.  
After all necessary round-trips are finished a last one-way run is made;
it moves the remaining bottles (≤24) forward and consumes just 1 bottle.

Step-3  –  notation for one mile
Let S be the number of unopened bottles that stand at the beginning of a
mile.  
g = ⌊S/25⌋ is the number of complete round-trips that have to be made  
(the MoJoPed can remove at most 25 bottles from the pile each time).  

Consumption for that mile
C(S) = 2g + 1   (because each round-trip costs 2, the final one-way costs 1)

The stock that reaches the next milepost is
S′ = S – C(S).

Step-4  –  run the five miles

mile 0→1 : S₀ = 120,   g=⌊120/25⌋=4,   C=2·4+1=9  ⇒ S₁ = 111  
mile 1→2 : S₁ = 111,   g=4,               C=9     ⇒ S₂ = 102  
mile 2→3 : S₂ = 102,   g=4,               C=9     ⇒ S₃ = 93  
mile 3→4 : S₃ = 93,    g=3,               C=7     ⇒ S₄ = 86  
mile 4→5 : S₄ = 86,    g=3,               C=7     ⇒ S₅ = 79  

After the fifth mile 79 unopened bottles are at the Wirth Pavilion.

Step-5  –  why this is best
• In every “there-and-back” the ratio 23 unopened : 2 lost is the
best possible; carrying fewer than 24 bottles would only worsen that
ratio.  
• Therefore the described strategy (always load the rack completely
until fewer than 25 bottles remain, then make the final one-way run)
minimises the number of bottles consumed on each mile.  
• Any other scheme would either use at least the same number of
round-trips or move fewer bottles, and so could not deliver more than 79
unopened bottles.

Final answer: 79",True
137,"Henry is a new civil engineer, and is charged with planning the laying of a new type of ultra-rigid rails that expand only one inch per mile of length in temperature extremes.  Henry's plan calls for the tracks (each of which is one mile in length) to be laid end-to-end with no gap between them, pinned to the ground at every other juncture, as shown below:
v_______ _______vv_______ _______v
Henry's boss sees the plan and says, ""You fool!  What about when the tracks expand?""
Henry replies, ""The expansion will only be an inch over the whole mile length.  If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.  The trains will certainly have no trouble bumping over these buckles.""
Henry's boss says, ""You're fired.""  Why was the boss so critical?",Would Pythagoras have the same plan?,"The rise in the middle of the tracks would have been much greater than Henry surmised.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Call the distance between two consecutive pins L and let the rise of the buckle at the middle be h (the “sagitta”).  
After the temperature rise each mile-long rail becomes 1 in = 1⁄12 ft longer, so the two rails that lie between two pins together become

δ = 2 in = 2⁄12 ft = 1⁄6 ft   (≈ 0.1667 ft)

longer than the straight distance between the pins.  
Because the ends are fixed to the ground, the extra 1⁄6 ft can be taken up only by bowing upward.  
The bowed rails will form, to very good approximation, a circular arc.

For a circular arc

chord length = 2R sin θ = L  
arc length   = 2R θ = L + δ  
sagitta      = R(1 – cos θ) = h.

For small θ   (the case here)   
sin θ ≈ θ – θ³⁄6, cos θ ≈ 1 – θ²⁄2,

so

δ = 2R(θ – sin θ) ≈ 2R·θ³⁄6 = R θ³⁄3,               (1)  
h = R(1 – cos θ) ≈ R·θ²⁄2.                          (2)

From the chord relation L = 2R sin θ ≈ 2Rθ we have R ≈ L /(2θ).  
Insert this in (1):

δ ≈ R θ³⁄3 ≈ (L /(2θ))·θ³⁄3 = L θ²⁄6   ⇒   θ² ≈ 6δ /L.               (3)

Put (3) into (2) and again R ≈ L /(2θ):

h ≈ R θ² ⁄2 ≈ (L /(2θ))·θ² ⁄2 = L θ ⁄4  
    ≈ L ⁄4 · √(6δ /L) = √( (3/8) · L · δ ).                          (4)

Now substitute the actual numbers.

The pins occur at every other rail joint, i.e. 2 miles apart:

L = 2 mi = 2·5280 ft = 10 560 ft,  δ = 1⁄6 ft.

h ≈ √( (3/8) · 10 560 · 1⁄6 )  
   = √( 0.375 · 10 560 · 0.1667 )  
   = √( 660 ) ≈ 25.7 ft.

So the rails would have to rise about twenty-six feet in the middle to absorb the extra inch per mile of length.  Even if Henry had pinned every joint (so L = 1 mile), the buckle height would still be

h ≈ √( (3/8) · 5280 · 1⁄12 ) ≈ 12.8 ft.

A locomotive cannot “bump over” a hump a dozen (let alone two-dozen) feet high.  
Henry forgot that a tiny fractional change in length, when the ends are fixed, produces a very large deflection.

Final answer:  Because the rails are anchored, the extra inch per mile must be taken up by bowing; the geometry shows the buckle would be on the order of 25 ft high (even 13 ft with pins every mile), far too large for a train to negotiate.",True

Mouse(A) bites off one rope in 60 minutes.
Mouse(B) bites off one rope in 90 minutes.
Mouse(C) bites off one rope in 180 minutes.
You do not have any time or distance measuring tools and the length of the rope is unknown.  How can you measure 75 minutes?",Set distance and time relations and equations,"Mark the two ropes as Rope(A) and Rope(B).
1. Let Mouse(A) and Mouse(C) start biting off Rope(A) at the same time, starting each from  one end (moving in opposite directions).  At the same time, let Mouse(B) start biting off Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(A) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X = S(A) * 60, where S(A) is biting speed for Mouse(A) and X is Rope(A) length
X = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X is Rope(A) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(A)/S(C) = 3:1, which means that for each 3 units Mouse(A) will move, Mouse (C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(A) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(A) bites off three times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides Rope(A) length in to 4 units.
Mouse(A) bitten off portion = 3/4 X (where X is Rope(A) length)
Mouse(C) bitten off portion = 1/4 X
Finding the time spent before Rope(A) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(A) needs  60 minutes to bite off X, How many minutes are needed to bite off 3/4 X?
Minutes needed = 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes are needed to fully bite off Rope(A) by Mouse(A) and Mouse(C).  At that point in time, Mouse(B) would have bitten off exactly half the length of Rope(B) (needing 90 minutes to bite off the full rope), and needs an additional 45 minutes to bite off the remaining rope half.
2. Let Mouse(B) continue biting off Rope(B) and make Mouse(C) start biting off the other end of Rope(B).
Finding relative speeds between Mouse(B) and Mouse(C):
Distance = Speed * Time
X/2 = S(B) * 90, where S(B) is biting speed for Mouse(B) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
X/2 = S(C) * 180, where S(C) is biting speed for Mouse(C) and X/2 is the remaining half of Rope(B) length
Solving the two above equations gives:
S(B)/S(C) = 2:1, which means that for each 2 units Mouse(B) will move, Mouse(C) will move 1 unit.
Moving in opposite directions (assume Mouse(B) from left to right and Mouse(C) from right to left), the two mice will meet after Mouse(B) bites off two times what Mouse(C) bit off, which divides the remaining half of Rope(B) length to 3 units.

Finding the time spent before the remaining half of Rope(B) is completely bitten off by the two mice:
If Mouse(B) needs  90 minutes to bite off X, how many minutes are needed to bite off X/3?
Minutes needed = 1/3 * 90 = 30 minutes are needed to fully bite off the remaining half of Rope(B) by Mouse(B) and Mouse(C).

 Mouse C : L / 180 rope-lengths per minute  

Step 1.  Start the clock and give Rope 1 to all three mice, all chewing from the same end.
Their combined biting rate is
 L/60 + L/90 + L/180 = L (1/60+1/90+1/180) = L (6/180) = L/30.
Hence Rope 1 is completely eaten in 30 minutes.
The moment the rope disappears we know exactly 30 minutes have elapsed.

This contains nine ones, so it is divisible by 9, and two 0's at the end, so it is divisible by 25.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the total number of gums Rob ate.

1.  Every package contains 225 gums, so N must be a positive multiple of 225:
      N = 225 k   for some integer k ≥ 1.

2.  The decimal expansion of N may use only the digits 0 and 1.

3.  Factor 225:
      225 = 9 × 25.

   Hence N must be divisible by both 9 and 25.

–––– Divisibility by 25 ––––
A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, 75.  
Because only 0’s and 1’s are allowed, the only possible ending is 00.  
So N ends in 00.

–––– Divisibility by 9 ––––
A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
Since the digits can only be 0 or 1, the sum of the digits equals the count of 1’s in N.  
Therefore:
      (# of 1’s in N) ≡ 0  (mod 9).

–––– Minimum length ––––
Let k be the count of digits before the obligatory final “00”.  
Then N has k + 2 total digits, with k ≥ 1 and its first digit equal to 1.

• If k ≤ 8, the maximum possible number of 1’s is k ≤ 8 < 9; the digit-sum can’t reach a multiple of 9.  
  Therefore k must be at least 9.

• Take k = 9 (the smallest admissible).  
  To make the digit-sum a multiple of 9 we need exactly 9 ones (because we cannot exceed 9 ones when k = 9, and we need a non-zero multiple of 9).  
  Hence all nine of those digits must be 1.

Thus the only possible 11-digit candidate is

      11111111100.

–––– Verification ––––
Sum of digits = 9 ⇒ divisible by 9.  
Ends with 00 ⇒ divisible by 25.  
Hence it is divisible by 225.

Because any valid N must contain at least 11 digits (argument above) and there is only one 11-digit possibility, 11111111100 is the smallest.

The only way to get a trailing zero is by multiplying a factor of 1000! which is 2 by a factor of 1000! which is 5. The modified problem is thus: How many such pairs of factors are there?
There are 500 = 1000/2 numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) which are even, so there are at least 500 factors of 2 in 1000!. There are 200 = 1000/5 numbers which are multiples of 5. But in addition there are 40 = 1000/25 numbers which are multiples of 25, each of which gives one factor of five in addition to the one counted in the 200 and the one counted in the 40 above. Finally there is 1 = [1000/625] number which is a multiple of 625, this gives one further factor of 5. Thus there are exactly  200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249 factors of 5 in 1000! and since there are more than sufficient factors of 2, there are exactly 249 trailing zeros in 1000!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To find the number of trailing zeros at the end of 1000!, we must determine how many times 10 divides 1000!.  

A factor of 10 is composed of one factor 2 and one factor 5.

Step-by-step count of factors of 5 in 1000!:

1. Divide by 5: ⌊1000/5⌋ = 200  
   (Every 5th integer contributes at least one factor 5.)

2. Divide by 25 = 5²: ⌊1000/25⌋ = 40

When a number of riders reach the finish in one bunch they are all given the same time; only if a gap appears is a slower time recorded for the riders that are dropped.  
So a man can cross the line 1st or 93rd inside the same group and still be given exactly the same time.

Picture the following perfectly possible development of the 14 stages.

•  In every stage a leading bunch of 93 riders reaches the finish together.  
   The champion always heads this bunch, “Crazy” Charles is always the last man of it, hence he is 93rd every day.  
   All 93 riders therefore receive the same stage time.  

•  Behind that bunch seven riders are dropped and arrive several minutes later.  
   Because they arrive in a second group they are all credited with the extra minutes that separated them from the first bunch.

•  Each day the seven dropped riders are different ones, and during the 14 stages every one of the 98 riders that are neither the champion nor Charles is, once and only once, among those seven.  

Counting:  
14 stages × 7 riders dropped each day = 98 riders – exactly the whole field except the champion and Charles.

Consequences for the general classification

– The champion never loses contact with the first bunch; he keeps exactly the basic time of the bunch and also gains small time bonuses for winning the stages, so he finishes first overall.

– Charles also never loses contact with the first bunch; he therefore has exactly the same basic time as the champion, only lacking the few bonus seconds.  
  Hence he is a few seconds slower than the champion.

– Every other competitor is, on one single stage, in the group that came in minutes late; each of them therefore has at least several minutes more than Charles in the accumulated time.

Thus at the end of the 14 stages the only rider whose total time is shorter than Charles’s is the champion, and “Crazy” Charles, although he was never better than 93rd in any individual stage, is runner-up in the final general classification.

Final answer: Because Charles always reached the finish in the main bunch he never lost time, while every other rider except the eventual champion got dropped at least once and lost several minutes; accumulated time, not daily placings, decides the race, so Charles ended second overall even though he was 93rd in every stage.",True

Hence after a year in which there was inflation first, followed by a slowdown, and the cost of a Red Rose bouquet decreased by 162 Roka, the price of the bouquet

Substituting the above value of Y^2 in equation 1, we get
B*0.09 = 162
Hence B = 162/0.09 = 1800 Roka.
Therefore the original price of the  Red Rose bouquet is 1800 Roka.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

P₀ = original price of the bouquet (in Roka)  
Y % = rate used in both the inflation and the slowdown  
r = Y/100 (so r is the decimal form, e.g. 30 % ⇒ r = 0.30)

Each year the shopkeeper  
1. raises the price by Y %  ⇒  multiply by (1 + r)  
2. then lowers that new price by Y % ⇒ multiply by (1 − r)

Hence one complete “inflation–slowdown” cycle multiplies the price by  
(1 + r)(1 − r) = 1 − r².  
Thus the price after one year is P₀(1 − r²).

FIRST YEAR  
Price drop = P₀ − P₀(1 − r²) = P₀r² = 162  (1)

SECOND YEAR  
Starting price for year 2 is P₀(1 − r²).  
After the same two-step change the drop is  
P₀(1 − r²)·r² = P₀r²(1 − r²) = 147.42  (2)

Divide (2) by (1):

P₀r²(1 − r²) / (P₀r²) = 147.42 / 162  
⇒ 1 − r² = 147.42 / 162 = 0.91  
⇒ r² = 1 − 0.91 = 0.09  
⇒ r = 0.30  (30 %)

Now find P₀ from (1):

P₀r² = 162  
⇒ P₀ = 162 / 0.09 = 1800.

So the bouquet originally cost 1800 Roka.

151,"In our business, my two partners and I usually cut a lot of cake. However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.
On one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.
First, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.
Second, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.
Third, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.
Fourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)
For discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.  Etc.
About this time, Junior, our partner-in-waiting, said, ""Cousins, I can do this, and I'll get to take a share of the cake.""
Knowing Junior, we asked, ""How big a headache is your math gonna give us?""
She answered, ""I can prove it without using trig, powers, roots, or the Pythagorean Theorem.""
Name the polygon she chose, tell how to divide it, and if you can, give proof the portions are equal.",Junior's proof uses fact that all dimensions of an isosceles right triangle are determined by its name and the length of its hypotenuse.,"Junior knew an octagon would sequentially yield four quarters.
After labeling the points of a perfect octagon, Junior told us, ""Before I cut the cake, I'll give the proof. First, I mark a line from A to D.  This creates a trapezoid (trapezium in Britain) ABCD.  Next, I mark the lines EH, BG, and CF.  These four lines crosshatch the area dividing it into 1 square surrounded by 4 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.""
The partners (me included) chimed in with the rest of these observations: The sides of the square are the same length as those of the octagon. Dividing the central square into isosceles right triangles (by marking both of its diagonals) would yield 4 triangles equivalent to the first 4. The total area of the octagon can be accounted for by 8 equal triangles and 4 equal rectangles.   Because it is made of 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, trapezoid ABCD is 1/4 of the octagon. A second trapezoid taken from the irregular hexagon ADEFGH will equal 1/4 of the octagon and leave 1/2 of the original octagon in the shape of a rectangle or a kite, either of which is easily split to provide the last two 1/4's.

        representation consists of one repeating digit (111, 2222, 777, …).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  What size can the rep-digit be?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the smallest possible product of two such 2-digit numbers is  
13 × 57 = 741, the result after subtracting C is at least 741–9 = 732,
so the rep-digit must contain at least three digits and at most four
digits (the largest possible product 97 × 53 = 5141 is still < 9999).

2.  Searching systematically
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Write the rep-digit as d·(111…1k) with digit d∈{1,…,9} and
k∈{3,4}.  The required equation is

        (10A+B)(10D+E) = d·(111…1k) + C,        1 ≤ C ≤ 9.

Hence the product of the first and last two–digit numbers must exceed a
rep-digit by at most 9.

Rather than test all 5! = 120 arrangements individually we can list,
for each choice of the four outer digits, every possible product of two
distinct 2-digit numbers, and check whether it lies 1–9 above a
rep-digit.

Carrying this out (there are only 18 distinct products to examine for
each middle digit) gives just one successful product:

        39 × 57 = 2223   (which is 1 greater than 2222).

Here the four digits used are 3,9,5,7, so the only digit left for the
centre is 1.  Therefore the five-digit numbers that satisfy the
condition are produced by placing 1 in the middle and choosing either
order for the two 2-digit factors:

        39 1 57   and   57 1 39.

Both use every odd digit exactly once and meet the required property,

When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?",Rates problem--use the same algebraic techniques,"The cow, the goat, and the goose eat grass with a constant speed (amount per day): v1 for the cow, v2 for the goat, v3 for the goose.
The grass grows with a constant amount per day (k).
The amount of grass at the beginning is h.
There is given:
When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 45 days. Therefore, h-45x(v1+v2-k) = 0, so v1+v2-k = h/45 = 4xh/180.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no grass left after 60 days. Therefore, h-60x(v1+v3-k) = 0, so v1+v3-k = h/60 = 3xh/180.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v1-k) = 0, so v1-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is also no grass left after 90 days. Therefore, h-90x(v2+v3-k) = 0, so v2+v3-k = h/90 = 2xh/180.
From this follows:

At this point, each member of the core group knows everything. Now, each person outside the core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4 calls, for a total of 2n-4.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let g(n) be the minimum number of telephone calls that guarantee that n people each finish knowing every one of the n different pieces of gossip.

   Label the people P₁,P₂,…,Pₙ (n ≥ 4).

   Stage 1  (n − 2 calls – “collect” the news)  
   P₁ is the collector.  
   P₂,P₃,…,Pₙ₋₁ successively ring P₁.  
   After these n−2 calls P₁ knows every secret except Pₙ’s;  
   the last caller, Pₙ₋₁, knows every secret except Pₙ’s as well, because
   when Pₙ₋₁ rang P₁ the latter already possessed the information coming
   from everybody up to Pₙ₋₂.

   Stage 2  (n − 2 calls – “broadcast” the news)  
   Now use Pₙ₋₁, who already knows almost everything, to spread the
   information outward:

   Pₙ rings Pₙ₋₁, then Pₙ₋₂ rings Pₙ₋₁, then Pₙ₋₃ rings Pₙ₋₁, … , finally P₂ rings Pₙ₋₁.

   In every one of these n−2 calls Pₙ₋₁ passes on the whole stock of
   gossip, therefore after the last of them everybody knows everything.

   Total number of calls = (n − 2)+(n − 2)=2n − 4.

2.  A lower bound of 2n − 4 calls when n ≥ 4  

   Look at the two people, say A and B, who speak in the very first
   telephone call.  Their two secrets, s_A and s_B, are initially known to
   one person each.  In the final situation every secret is known to all n
   people, so each of s_A and s_B has to be communicated to the remaining
   n−1 people.

   A single telephone call can convey a given secret to at most one new
   person (only the two participants are involved).  Hence, taken
   separately, each of s_A and s_B needs at least n−1 transmissions.  The
   very first call and the very last call can each carry both secrets
   simultaneously, so up to two of these transmissions can be “shared”.
   Consequently the total number of calls is at least

          (n−1) + (n−1) − 2 = 2n − 4.

   Therefore no scheme can use fewer than 2n−4 calls.

3.  Small n  

   g(1)=0   (nothing to exchange)  
   g(2)=1   (the two people ring once)  
   g(3)=3   (e.g. 1–2, 1–3, 2–3)

Putting the pieces together,

          g(n)=  0,   n=1

So the smallest possible number of telephone calls among n people who
initially hold n different pieces of gossip is

??? x 3? = ????",1?? x 3? = ?254,186 x 39 = 7254,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We have to place each of the digits 1-9 exactly once into the pattern  

ABC × 3D = EFGH ,  

where  

• ABC is a three–digit number,  
• 3D is a two–digit number whose tens digit is the fixed 3,  
• EFGH is a four–digit product,  
• no digit may be repeated anywhere in the whole equation.

1.  Digit-count check  
   The pattern contains 9 slots (A,B,C, 3, D, E,F,G,H).  
   Using the digit 3 in the tens place of the second factor leaves the other eight different digits 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 to be distributed among the remaining eight slots.

2.  Size restrictions  
   The largest possible two-digit multiplier is 39.  
   To keep the product four-digit, ABC must satisfy  
                 ABC × 31 ≤ 9999   →   ABC ≤ 322,  
                 ABC × 39 ≤ 9999   →   ABC ≤ 256.  
   Hence ABC lies between 124 (the smallest 3–digit number with distinct, non-zero, non-3 digits) and 256.

3.  Eliminate D = 1  
   If D = 1 the units digit of the product would equal C (because ABC × 31 ends in C), repeating a digit — impossible.  
   So D ∈ {2,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

4.  Try the largest multiplier first: D = 9 (multiplier 39)  
   • ABC must not contain 3 or 9.  
   • ABC ≤ 256.  
   Candidate ABC’s are therefore numbers such as 124,125,126,…,256 with distinct digits drawn from {1,2,4,5,6,7,8}.  

   Compute ABC × 39 (= ABC × 40 – ABC) for each candidate, rejecting any product that  
        – is not four-digit,  
        – contains 3 or 9,  
        – repeats a digit already used in the factors.

   The first candidate that works is

            186 × 39 = 7254

   Check digit usage:  
         factors use 1,8,6,3,9 ;  
         product uses 7,2,5,4.  
   Together they give exactly the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with no repetition.

5.  Uniqueness  
   Repeating the same test for all remaining candidates and for the smaller multipliers 38, 37, …, 32 shows no other combination satisfies all the requirements; hence the solution found is unique.

The area of a square is `length squared`. First find the area of the entire square. The length is (a+b). The area of the square is (a+b)^2. Inside the box there is a diamond with length `c`. The diamond is simply a square tilted 45 degrees. The area of the diamond is c^2. There are also 4 triangles with area 1/2ab. Set them equal:
(a+b)^2=c^2 + 4(1/2ab) Expand...

    •  Outer square: (a + b)².

Now lets say there are ""n"" people at the party. Now the nth person will know (n-1) people; (n-1)th person will know (n-2) people because no one knows the same number of people; similarly (n-2)th person will known (n-3) people. Thus, the 2nd person will know 1 person. Hence the 1st person[say A] will know 0 people or will know no one. Now since the nth person knows every one, he knows A .Therefore A knows the nth person. Hence our supposition is wrong and at least 2 people know the same number of people.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let n be the number of people at the party (n ≥ 2).

Step 1.  Associate to every person i the number  
 k_i = “how many people i knows (counting himself/herself).”  
Because everyone knows himself/herself and there are in total n people,
 1 ≤ k_i ≤ n for every i.

Step 2.  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that all those numbers k_1,…,k_n are different.  
Since we have n different integers, each lying between 1 and n inclusive, the only possibility is
 {k_1,…,k_n} = {1,2,…,n}.  
Hence

• there is one person P₁ who knows exactly 1 person;  
• there is one person Pₙ who knows exactly n people.

Step 3.  Analyse what P₁ and Pₙ know.

• P₁ knows exactly one person.  Because everybody knows himself/herself, that one person must be P₁ himself/herself; thus P₁ knows no one else.

• Pₙ knows n people, i.e. everybody in the party, and therefore knows P₁.

Step 4.  Use the symmetry of “knowing.”  
The statement “A knows B” is symmetric: if Pₙ knows P₁, then P₁ must know Pₙ as well.

But we just established that P₁ knows no one except himself/herself, so P₁ cannot know Pₙ.  
Contradiction.

Step 5.  Conclude.  
Our assumption that all k_i were different is impossible. Therefore at least two of the n party-goers have the same value of k_i; in other words, there exist two people who know exactly the same number of people.

N = 10a + d  

where  
  d (1 ≤ d ≤ 9) is the right-most digit and  
  a is the rest of the number (so N has k digits ⇒ a has k–1 digits).

After moving d to the front we get  

M = d·10^{k-1} + a .

The condition “the new number is 50 % larger” means  

d·10^{k-1} + a = 3/2 · (10a + d).

Multiply by 2 and rearrange:

2d·10^{k-1} – 3d = 28a

⇒ a = d(2·10^{k-1} – 3) / 28.  (1)

Thus d(2·10^{k-1} – 3) must be divisible by 28 = 4·7.

Step 1: Find 2·10^{k-1} – 3 (mod 28).  
Because 10^{n} (mod 28) has period 6,

10^{n} (mod 28) for n = 0…5: 1, 10, 16, 20, 4, 12  
2·10^{n} – 3 (mod 28) = 27, 17, 1, 9, 5, 21.

Hence 2·10^{k-1} – 3 ≡ 21 (mod 28) exactly when k–1 ≡ 5 (mod 6), i.e. k ≡ 0 (mod 6).

No other residue is divisible by 7, so k must be a multiple of 6; the smallest such k is 6.

Step 2: k = 6.  
Then 2·10^{5} – 3 = 200 000 – 3 = 199 997.

Write 199 997 = 28·7142 + 21.

To make d(199 997) divisible by 28 we already have the factor 7 in 21, so d must supply the factor 4.  
The only digits with a factor 4 are d = 4 or 8.

Compute a from (1):

d = 4: a = 4·199 997 / 28 = 4·7142 + 3 = 28 571  
d = 8: a = 8·199 997 / 28 = 8·7142 + 6 = 57 142.

Both a’s have 5 digits, so both are admissible, but we need the smaller resulting N.

For d = 4: N = 10a + d = 285 714  
For d = 8: N = 571 428

Hence the smallest number is 285 714.

This is an arithmetic–series sum, so

k(2a + k – 1) = 2N  (1)

Hence k must be a divisor of 2N.  Distinguish the two parities of k.

1.  k odd  
   Then k divides the left side of (1), so k must also divide 2N; but because k is odd it must actually divide N.  
   Write N = k·m with k odd (k ≥ 3).  
   The average of the k consecutive terms is m, so the sequence is

   m – (k–1)/2, m – (k–1)/2 + 1, … , m + (k–1)/2.

   Such a sequence exists exactly when k > 1 is an odd divisor of N.

   2r(2a + 2r – 1) = 2N  ⇒  r(2a + 2r – 1) = N. (2)

   The parenthesis is odd, so r must divide N and N/r must be odd.  
   Thus an even–length representation exists whenever N/r is odd, i.e. whenever N has a divisor r for which N/r is odd.

Putting the two cases together one finds the classical result:

A positive integer N can be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive (non-negative) integers iff N is not a power of 2.

(If N is a power of 2, it has no odd divisor larger than 1, and in (2) the requirement that N/r be odd forces r = N, which makes the first term a negative.)

Now look at the interval 1000 ≤ N ≤ 2000.  
The only power of 2 in this range is 2¹⁰ = 1024.  
Every other integer in the interval possesses an odd divisor > 1, hence each of them can be written as a sum of consecutive non-negative integers, while 1024 cannot.

Also a 3 digit id starting with a 0 was invalid since the machine used for swiping does not recognize a 3 digit id starting with a 0.
After a lot of careful analysis and discussion, we were able to figure out the maximum number of employees that could use this system. Can you repeat the feat?",Find numbers who do not have a duplicate that will be deleted,"It has been mentioned that a 3 digit code starting with a 0 is invalid. Hence we cannot use codes from 001 to 099.
Hence the total number of valid 3 digit id's is 900.
Out of these, three digit numbers that are symmetrical will have the same first and the last digit. The first and the last digit in this case can be selected in 9 ways(any number from 1 to 9). The second digit can be selected in 10 ways(any number from 0 to 9). Therefore number of symmetrical three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90. These 90 id's will not have a corresponding number when written in reverse order.
Secondly numbers ending with a zero will also not have a corresponding 3 digit number when written in reverse order. For example, reverse of 910 is 019 which is not a valid three digit code due to the condition given that 3 digit codes starting with 0 are invalid. Number of such three digit numbers = 9*10 = 90.
Rest of the (900-180) = 720 numbers can be classified into two groups of 360 numbers each, where corresponding pairs of numbers will be identical when written in reverse order. Hence consider only 360 of these numbers.
Therefore total number of valid employee id's possible = 90 + 90 + 360 = 540.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of every valid employee–ID as a 3-digit string abc

• a ∈ {1,…,9}   (first digit cannot be 0)  
• b ∈ {0,…,9}  
• c ∈ {0,…,9}

Total possible IDs = 9·10·10 = 900.

We must choose a subset so that no two chosen IDs are reverses of each other.

1. IDs whose last digit is 0 (c = 0)  
   Reverse = cba = 0ba → begins with 0, hence is NOT a valid ID.  
   Therefore these 9·10 = 90 IDs are conflict–free; we can keep them all.

2. IDs whose last digit is non-zero (c ≠ 0)

   a) Palindromes: abc = cba ⇒ a = c (and a ≠ 0).  
      Count: 9 (choices for a = c) · 10 (choices for b) = 90 IDs.  
      Each conflicts only with itself, so all 90 can be kept.

   b) Non-palindromes with c ≠ 0 and a ≠ c.  
      Count: 9·10·9 − 90 = 810 − 90 = 720 IDs.  
      These occur in disjoint reversal pairs {abc, cba}.  
      From each pair we may keep at most one, so we can keep exactly 720/2 = 360 of them.

Maximum number of employees =  
90 (c = 0) + 90 (palindromes) + 360 (one from each non-palindrome pair) = 540.

Evaluate both sides:

Left-hand side L = (A−1)A / 2.  
Right-hand side R = [N(N+1)/2] − [(A−1)A/2].

Equate L and R:

Insert (2) in (1).

Sum:

If N+A=7, then either O+S=2, or 1+O+S=2, meaning that O+S=1. But the two lowest digits used are 1 and 2, so the lowest possible sum of two letters is 3. Therefore, 1+N+A=7, which means that N+A=6 and O+S equals 11 or 12. Either one of N and A is 1 and the other is 5, or one is 2 and the other is 4.
If R+L=3, then one of R and L is 1 and the other is 2. But since one of 1 and 2 must be either N or A, this cannot work, so R+L must equal 13. Therefore, 1+E+A equals 11, and E+A equals 10.
Since R+L=13, then R and L must be, in some order, 4 and 9, 5 and 8, or 6 and 7.
If N=1 and A=5, then E must equal 5. But since A and E need to have different values, this cannot work.
If N=5 and A=1, then E=9. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
If N=2 and A=4, then E=6. R and L must be 5 and 8 in some order.
If N=4 and A=2, then E=8. R and L must be 6 and 7 in some order.
Since 1+I+R equals 6 or 16, I+R equals 5 or 15. Since R can only equal 5, 6, 7, or 8, I+R+15, so R cannot equal 5. Therefore:
If N=5, then R cannot be 6 because I would equal 9, and E=9. So R=7, L=6, and I=8.
If N=2, then since R cannot be 5, R=8, L=5, and I=7.
If N=4, then R cannot be 7 because I would equal 8, and E=8. So R=6, L=7, and I=9.
Since 1+S+T equals 5 or 15, S+T equals 4 or 14. If S+T=14, then S and T must be 5 and 9, or 6 and 8, in some order. But each of our three scenarios has a letter for at least one of 5 and 9, as well as one for 8. So S+T=4, S and T are 1 and 3 in some order, and O+S=12.
If S=1, then O=11. But since each letter represents only one digit, S=3, T=1, and O=9.

Of that list, 33 is the only number that contains a 3 as the second digit and so for criterion 3 to be satisfied, 3 can only appear at the start of the 5-digit numbers.  From there it is simply a matter of choosing the next digits using the list above so that criterion 2 is satisfied, making sure that criterion 3 is also satisfied.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  The only prime digits are 2, 3, 5 and 7.  
2.  For every adjacent pair of digits XY the 2-digit number 10·X+Y must be composite.  
    From the table of two–digit numbers built with the prime digits  

            22 23* 25 27
            32 33 35 37*
            52 53* 55 57
            72 73* 75 77  

    the starred ones (23, 37, 53, 73) are the only primes.  
    Hence the illegal consecutive pairs are exactly 23, 37, 53, 73.

3.  Consequence for the digit 3  
    •  A 3 that is not in the first position would have to be preceded by 3  
      (because 23, 53, 73 are forbidden).  
    •  But then that preceding 3 would again need a 3 before it, etc.  
      Therefore the only way to use the digit 3 is to put all 3’s
      in one solid block starting in the very first position.  
      Hence every admissible 5-digit number must begin with 3 and may
      contain no other 3’s after the initial block.

4.  Digits which can follow a leading block of 3’s  
    After the last 3 we may write 2 or 5 (not 7, because 37 is forbidden).  
    Among the remaining digits {2, 5, 7} no pair is forbidden, so once we
    have left the initial 3-block the rest of the number may be any string
    of 2’s, 5’s and 7’s (provided each of 2, 5, 7 occurs at least once).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Smallest admissible 5-digit number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take only one leading 3 (a longer 3-block would already make the number
larger), then choose the smallest possible digits thereafter while
honouring the conditions and making sure 2, 5 and 7 all appear:

    3 2 2 5 7

All four adjacent pairs are 32, 22, 25, 57 – all composite – and every
prime digit appears.  Hence the minimum is 32257.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Largest admissible 5-digit number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start with 3 and make every next digit as large as allowed.

• Second digit: 5 is the largest that may follow 3 (35 is composite).  
• Third digit: 7 is larger than 2 and is allowed after 5 (57 composite).  
• Fourth digit: another 7 is larger than 2 or 5 and is allowed after 7.  
• Fifth digit must be 2 (to ensure the digit 2 appears at least once and
  putting it last keeps the number largest).

Thus we get 3 5 7 7 2.

Pairs: 35, 57, 77, 72 – all composite – and all four prime digits appear.
No other arrangement can be larger, because any change would either
violate a rule or put a smaller digit earlier.

p   = number of pearls each girl finally receives (the judge said this is the same for every girl),  
Nᵢ = pearls left in the bag after the i-th girl has taken her whole share  
  (i = 0,1,2,…,k ; so Nₖ = 0).

Step performed by the i-th girl (i = 1,2,…,k)  
 1. She first takes i pearls.  
 2. From what then remains (N_{i-1} – i) she takes one seventh of it.  
Thus  

 p = i + 1/7 (N_{i-1} – i)                             (1)

After her turn the bag contains  

 Nᵢ = (6/7)(N_{i-1} – i).                             (2)

------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Eliminate the fractional term  
From (1) get N_{i-1} – i = 7(p – i).  
Insert this in (2):  

 Nᵢ = (6/7)·7(p – i) = 6(p – i).                      (3)

------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Apply the last step (i = k)  
The bag is empty afterwards, so Nₖ = 0.  
Putting i = k in (3):

 0 = 6(p – k)   ⇒   p = k.                            (4)  

Hence every girl finally gets exactly k pearls.

------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Work out the preceding step (i = 1)  
Put i = 1 and p = k in (1):

 k = 1 + 1/7(N₀ – 1)   ⇒   N₀ = 7k – 6.               (5)

Put i = 1 and p = k in (3):

 N₁ = 6(k – 1).                                       (6)

------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Go to the second girl (i = 2)  
Her turn starts with N₁ pearls in the bag, so (1) gives

 k = 2 + 1/7(N₁ – 2).

Insert N₁ from (6):

 k = 2 + 1/7(6(k – 1) – 2)  
 k = 2 + 1/7(6k – 8)  
 7k = 14 + 6k – 8  
 k = 6.                                               (7)

------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Determine all quantities  
From (4): p = k = 6.  
From (5): N₀ = 7·6 – 6 = 42 – 6 = 36.

------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verify the whole distribution  

Start: 36 pearls.  

Girl 1: takes 1 + (1/7 of 35) = 1 + 5 = 6 ⇒ 30 left.  
Girl 2: takes 2 + (1/7 of 28) = 2 + 4 = 6 ⇒ 24 left.  
Girl 3: takes 3 + (1/7 of 21) = 3 + 3 = 6 ⇒ 18 left.  
Girl 4: takes 4 + (1/7 of 14) = 4 + 2 = 6 ⇒ 12 left.  
Girl 5: takes 5 + (1/7 of 7)  = 5 + 1 = 6 ⇒  6 left.  
Girl 6: takes 6 + (1/7 of 0)  = 6 + 0 = 6 ⇒  0 left.

Each girl indeed receives 6 pearls and none remain.

Subtract (1) from (2):

We want the price of an ordinary meal:

M = b + s + f.

Solve f from (1):

Then

M = b + s + f  
   = b + s + (120 − 3b − 7s)

Use (3) to eliminate b:  
b = 44.50 − 3s.

Substitute:

M = 120 − 2(44.50 − 3s) − 6s

3.  The field is divided in proportion to the work rates.

Step 1 – place the unique 6  
The only primes containing a 6 are 61 and 67.  
If we chose 67 we would also exhaust the single 7, leaving no way to use the two 4’s (only 41, 43, 47 contain a 4, and 47 needs the 7 already spent).

However, the problem says the arc can only intersect A and B. To do this, the circle must be slightly larger than the one described above. As stated in the problem, the larger arc must be the next largest integer size, which is 181 degrees.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the two given lines be rays OA and OB that meet at the point O with ∠AOB = 90°.

Because each ray meets the circle in exactly one point (A on OA and B on OB) the rays must be tangent to the circle at those points.  Thus OA and OB are two tangents to the same circle, intersecting at O.

A standard theorem for two tangents to a circle states:

Angle between two tangents = ½ (major arc − minor arc).

If we denote the minor arc AB by x°, then the major arc AB measures 360° − x°.  
Substituting into the theorem:

∠AOB = ½ [(360° − x) − x]  
90° = ½ (360° − 2x)  
90° = 180° − x  
x = 90°.

Hence the minor arc AB is 90°, so the larger (major) arc AB is

360° − 90° = 270°.

This is already an integer and is the only possible value under the conditions, so it is the smallest integral size of the larger arc.

If Kurt’s percentage is p %, then p = R and

 K/T = p/100 = R/100.

We look for the smallest positive integer R (< 100) for which (1) is integral.

Checking R = 1, 2, 3, …, 19 gives non-integers.  
R = 20 gives

 K = 20² /(100 – 20) = 400/80 = 5

Rod’s 20 pieces equal Kurt’s 20 % of 25, and 25 is the smallest total possible.

 R = 60 → K = 60² /(100 – 60) = 3600/40 = 90, T = 150.

This uses C = 3 cases (150 pieces), gives Kurt more than Rod, and keeps Kurt’s share (90) below 100.  
No other R (< 100) satisfies all these conditions.

Three is the smallest number whose product is greater than its sum.  Therefore you want to include as many 3's in the answer as possible.  Then make 2's (or 4's) out of the remainder.
20 / 3 = 6, remainder 2 so 3^6 x 2",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We want to split 20 into positive integers n₁+n₂+…+n_k = 20 so that the product P = n₁ n₂ … n_k is as large as possible.

Key facts (well-known, but can be proved quickly):

1. Any part greater than 4 should be broken up, because  
   m ≥ 5  ⇒ m = 3+(m−3) or m = 2+(m−2) gives the same sum but a larger product:  
   3(m−3) = 3m−9 > m for m ≥ 5.

2. Therefore an optimal decomposition uses only 2’s and 3’s.

Let x = number of 3’s, y = number of 2’s.

Equation of the sum: 3x + 2y = 20.

Possible integer pairs (x, y):

x = 0 → y = 10  → P = 2¹⁰      = 1024  
x = 2 → y = 7   → P = 3²·2⁷   = 9·128  = 1152  
x = 4 → y = 4   → P = 3⁴·2⁴   = 81·16 = 1296  
x = 6 → y = 1   → P = 3⁶·2¹   = 729·2 = 1458

(Other x give non-integer y or negative y.)

The largest product attained is 1458 when we take six 3’s and one 2, i.e. the partition

20 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2.

   Therefore the last digit of N is an odd digit d with 5d ≡ 5 (mod 10) and d ≠ 5.  
   Hence d ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}.

2. Take N to be 4-digits long; then 5 N will be 5-digits long (4 + 5 = 9 digits total).

189,"A man is standing on a railway bridge joining locations A and B.  He is 3/8 the distance across, walking from A to B.  He hears a train approaching behind him (from A's side); it is traveling 80 kph (that's kilometers per hour for you non-metric fans!)  If he were to run back to A, he would meet the train at A.  If he were to run to B, the train would overtake him at B.
How fast can the man run?","You will never know exact distances in this problem, nor will you actually need to.  Remember distance equals rate times time, or D = RT.  I recommend drawing a picture to map out other distances, such as the man to A and B, respectively.","Start by assigning some variables.  We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.
The man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).
The time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.
The time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).
Set these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?
So what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.
Feel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.  The man travels 5/8 y, or 5/8 (2/3 x), which is 5/12 x.  And 5/3 divided by 5/12 is 1/4 again, so there you go.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

2. Running forward to B

What is the number?",Eliminate possibilities within 50-79,76,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the integer.

Rewrite each statement in “if … then …” form and also its contrapositive (which is logically equivalent and often more useful).

1. If N is NOT a multiple of 4  →  60 ≤ N ≤ 69.  
   Contrapositive: If N < 60 or N > 69  →  N IS a multiple of 4.

2. If N IS a multiple of 3  →  50 ≤ N ≤ 59.  
   Contrapositive: If N < 50 or N > 59  →  N is NOT a multiple of 3.

3. If N is NOT a multiple of 6  →  70 ≤ N ≤ 79.  
   Contrapositive: If N < 70 or N > 79  →  N IS a multiple of 6.

Step 1.  Show N cannot lie below 50 or above 79.  
Below 50 (or above 79) we have all three contrapositives active:

• must be a multiple of 4 (from 1)  
• must NOT be a multiple of 3 (from 2)  
• must be a multiple of 6 (from 3, which forces a multiple of 3)

The last two requirements are incompatible, so N cannot be <50 or >79.

Step 2.  Show N cannot be in 50–59.  
50–59 is outside 60–69 and 70–79, so again N has to be a multiple of 4 and of 6 (from contrapositives 1 and 3), hence a multiple of 12; but there is no multiple of 12 between 50 and 59.  Impossible.

Step 3.  Show N cannot be in 60–69.  
60–69 is outside 70–79, so N must be a multiple of 6 (contrapositive 3).  
But 60–69 is also outside 50–59, so N is NOT a multiple of 3 (contrapositive 2).  
These two demands clash (a multiple of 6 is automatically a multiple of 3).  Impossible.

Step 4.  Therefore N must lie in 70–79.  
In this range:

• Because it is outside 60–69, N must be a multiple of 4 (contrapositive 1).  
• Because it is outside 50–59, N must NOT be a multiple of 3 (contrapositive 2).

List the numbers 70–79 that are multiples of 4: 72 and 76.  
Among them, 72 is divisible by 3, 76 is not.

Thus the only candidate is N = 76.

Verification:

1. 76 is a multiple of 4, so the hypothesis of statement 1 is false; the implication is true.  
2. 76 is not a multiple of 3, so the hypothesis of statement 2 is false; the implication is true.  
3. 76 is not a multiple of 6 and indeed lies between 70 and 79; statement 3 is satisfied.

And using another six matches Mad Ade could again do precisely the same.
How many matches were there in the box originally?
Note that the match-box can hold maximum of 50 matches.",There are two possible answers!,"Initially, there were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
There are 42 matches in the box with which he could form a triangle 20, 15, 7, with an area of 42 square inches. After 6 matches had been used, the remaining 36 matches would form a triangle 17, 10, 9, with an area of 36 square inches. After using another 6 matches, the remaining 30 matches would form a triangle 13, 12, 5, with an area of 30 square inches. After using another 6, the 24 remaining would form a triangle 10, 8, 6, with an area of 24 square inches.
Thus, there are two possible answers. There were either 42 or 36 matches in the match-box.
Also it is interesting to know that there are just 5 such triangles for which the perimeter and the area is the same (assuming all sides are integers) and they are :
24 (10, 8, 6)
30 (13, 12, 5)
36 (17, 10, 9)
42 (20, 15, 7)
60 (29, 25, 6)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the three integral side–lengths (in inches) of a triangle be  
a , b , c ( 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ) and let  

P = a + b + c             (perimeter = number of matches)  
s = P/2                   (semiperimeter)  

Because every match is 1 inch long, P is an integer.  
Mad Ade’s condition is

area = P.                                                     (1)

By Heron’s formula  

area² = s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c).

Set  

x = s – a, y = s – b, z = s – c   (all positive integers).

Then  

a = s – x, b = s – y, c = s – z,

and the perimeter becomes  

P = a + b + c = 3s – (x + y + z) = 2s, so x + y + z = s.   (2)

Condition (1) gives, after squaring,

P² = sxyz ⇒ (2s)² = sxyz ⇒ xyz = 4s.                      (3)

So we must find positive integers (x,y,z) whose

 • sum is s,       (2)  
 • product is 4s.         (3)

Because the match-box can hold at most 50 matches, P ≤ 50, hence s ≤ 25.

We simply test every s = 4,…,25 for the existence of x,y,z satisfying (2) and (3).  
Only three semiperimeters work:

s = 15 → x,y,z = 10,3,2   (check 10+3+2=15, 10·3·2=60=4·15)  
  Triangle: a,b,c = 5,12,13  P = 30, area = 30

s = 18 → x,y,z = 9,8,1    (check 9+8+1=18, 9·8·1=72=4·18)  
  Triangle: a,b,c = 9,10,17  P = 36, area = 36

s = 21 → x,y,z = 14,6,1   (check 14+6+1=21, 14·6·1=84=4·21)  
  Triangle: a,b,c = 7,15,20  P = 42, area = 42

Hence the only perimeters not exceeding 50 for which (1) can hold are

P = 30, 36, 42.

Mad Ade’s story needs three successive steps, each time using six fewer matches.  
That fits exactly the sequence 42 → 36 → 30.

Therefore the little box originally contained 42 matches.

198,"Detective Grant was inspecting the scene of the crime. The 50-year-old victim, Joe, had been poisoned by a candy containing cyanide. On the table surrounding him were 9 other candies, but none of them contained cyanide. This murder was highly suspicious, because Joe had just gotten off a 2-yr jail sentence.
Grant was very puzzled, because he had recently come across three similar murders, none of which had been solved. Jeff, 30, had gotten off a 10-yr sentence a few weeks ago. The next day, he had been found murdered in the same fashion as Joe, but in his case only 3 candies were left on the table. John, 46, was found with 5 candies the day after a 4-yr sentence had been turned over a week ago. Jim, 35, had gotten off a 5-yr sentence a few days ago, only to be found dead with 6 candies yesterday.
Grant puzzled over these cases for days, and then -boom- it hit him. There was a pattern in these murders! What pattern did Grant spot?
Each suspect ate a candy before they died.
Life expectancy when the murders were committed was 70 years.
(It was also curious that many criminals had been let off their sentences too, but had not been killed. 23, in fact, had gotten off.)","SUSPECT--AGE--SENTENCE--CANDIES
Joe--------50----2 years-------9
Jeff--------30----10 yrs--------3
John-------46----4 yrs---------5
Jim--------35----5 yrs----------6","The killer was a prosecutor (George) who thought that the criminal deserved a chance to live outside of jail. When the case came before him, he dismissed it. He then went to the criminal's house, and offered him a chance to gamble his life, or go to jail. George offered him a certain number of candies, one of which was poisoned. If the criminal chose a poisoned candy, he died. If he chose a pure candy, he lived.
The criminal's remaining life expectancy divided by his prison sentence would be the number of candies George would bring him, one of which might kill him. In the case of Joe:
His remaining life expectancy at age 50 was 20. 20 divided by 2(his sentence) is 10. George brought him 10 candies, one of which was poisoned. Joe ate the poisoned one, and left nine on the table.
The 23 criminals who got off their sentences, but did not die, chose pure candies.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Grant realised that the three data in every file – the man’s age, the length of the term he had just served and the number of candies that had been put in front of him – were not random at all:  

If “life-expectancy” is taken to be 70 years, then  

 number of candies (the total, including the one the man ate) = (70 − age of the man) ÷ (years of the sentence he served).

Checking it on the four dead men:

• Joe: 70 − 50 = 20; 20 ÷ 2 = 10 candies (9 left on the table).  
• Jeff: 70 − 30 = 40; 40 ÷ 10 = 4 candies (3 left).  
• John: 70 − 46 = 24; 24 ÷ 4 = 6 candies (5 left).  
• Jim: 70 − 35 = 35; 35 ÷ 5 = 7 candies (6 left).

199,Lester has 40 kilograms of wheat. He has a simple balance and 4 weights of whole number denominations. The 4 weights are such that he is able to measure any whole number amount of wheat from 1 to 40 (no fractions). He can use a combination of two or more weights on any side of the balance as required. He can also use one weight on the left side and two or more weights on the right along with the wheat to weigh the required amount if necessary. What are the 4 weights Lester has?,"There is a common ratio between the weights; this way, it allows for coverage with addition and subtraction","The weights Lester uses are 1,3,9 and 27 kg.
For 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39 and 40 kg, he just needs to put the wheat on one side and the right combination of weights on the other side.
For 2, 8, 11, 26, 29, 35 and 38 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 1 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 6, 7, 24, 25, 33, and 34 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 3 kg weight on one side and enough weights to make 3 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
For 5, 23, and 32 kg he needs to put the wheat plus the 1 and 3 kg weights on one side and enough weights to make 4 more kg than he is trying to weigh up on the other side.
Similarly,

15 = 27-9-3
16 = 27+1-9-3

...where negative numbers indicate weights that are on the same side of the wheat and positive numbers indicate weights that have been placed on the opposite side of the wheat.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-1.  Basic observations  
•  Call the four integral weights w1 < w2 < w3 < w4.  
•  When a balance allows weights on both pans, weighing k kg of wheat is the same as writing  
  k = ε1w1 + ε2w2 + ε3w3 + ε4w4 with εi ∈ {-1,0,1}.  
•  If the largest positive total that the first n weights can produce is Rn = w1+…+wn, then adding another weight w(n+1) will give continuous coverage up to Rn+1 provided there is no “gap” between old and new ranges.  
  The no-gap condition is  
  w(n+1) ≤ 2Rn + 1. (Reason: the interval [-Rn, Rn] must overlap the shifted interval [-Rn+w(n+1), Rn+w(n+1)].)

Step-2.  Building the weights  

1) The smallest weight must be 1 kg, otherwise 1 kg of wheat cannot be weighed.  
 w1 = 1, R1 = 1.

2) For w2 we need w2 ≤ 2·R1 + 1 = 3, and w2 > w1 = 1.  
 If w2 = 2: even choosing the later weights as large as allowed we get  
  maximum possible total = 1 + 2 + 7 + 21 = 31 < 40,  
 so w2 cannot be 2. Hence  
 w2 = 3, R2 = 4.

3) For w3 we need w3 ≤ 2·R2 + 1 = 9 and w3 > 3.  
 Trying any value 4 ≤ w3 ≤ 8 gives final total at most  
  1 + 3 + w3 + (9 + 2w3) = 13 + 3w3 ≤ 13 + 24 = 37 < 40,  
 so none of these work. Therefore  
 w3 = 9, R3 = 13.

4) Finally w4 must satisfy w4 ≤ 2·R3 + 1 = 27 and be > 9.  
 Choosing the largest allowed value maximises the total: w4 = 27.  
 Total weight = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, exactly what is required.

Step-3.  Verifying completeness  
The set {1, 3, 9, 27} is the set of the first four powers of 3.  
Every integer 0…40 has a balanced-ternary representation (digits −1,0,1) using at most four digits, e.g.  
 40 = 1·27 + 1·9 + 1·3 + 1·1,  
 26 = 1·27 − 1·1,  
 17 = 1·9 + 1·3 + 1·1 + (−1)·27, etc.  
Placing weights whose coefficients are −1 on the same pan as the wheat and the others on the opposite pan achieves every whole number mass from 1 kg to 40 kg.

Step-4.  Uniqueness  
At each stage the choice was forced:  
w1 must be 1; w2 cannot be 2 (insufficient total), hence 3; w3 must be 9 for similar reasons; w4 then must be 27 to reach 40.  Therefore the solution is unique.

How much rope did Mr. Collins really need?",Mr. Collins's answer key gives the actual dimensions of the yard; he didn't realize there were two other answers from the hints he gave.,"37 feet.
There are three triangles that fit the given hints, having sides
40, 42, 58
24, 70, 74
15, 112, 113
From the students' comments, we know that the Collins yard has the middle-sized hypotenuse.
A right triangle inscribes neatly into a semicircle, with the hypotenuse forming a diameter.  The shortest rope needed to reach all points is one staked at the midpoint of the hypotenuse, forming a radius of the circle.  74/2 = 37 feet.
The blond student found the first answer above, and would have used a rope of 29 feet.  The other student figured it at 113/2, or 56.5 feet.
Historical note:
Lewis Carroll searched for the answer to the basic mathematical problem, sent to him by a reader.  He found two right triangles with the same area, but couldn't discover a set of three.  Somewhat ironically, Carroll had found 20-21-29 and 12-35-37.  Had he doubled their dimensions, he would have had the first two triangles above, and quite likely would have found the third.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the legs of the right triangle be a and b (a ≤ b) and the hypotenuse be c.

1.  Area condition  
   ½·a·b = 840  ⇒ a·b = 1680.

2.  Pythagorean-triple condition  
   a² + b² = c², with a, b, c integers.

Therefore we need all factor pairs (a, b) of 1680 for which a²+b² is a perfect square.

Factor pairs of 1680 (with a ≤ b) and the corresponding sums of squares are:

24  70      5476    yes → c = 74
40  42      3364    yes → c = 58

Thus there are exactly three integral right triangles of area 840 ft²:

1) 15-112-113  2) 24-70-74  3) 40-42-58

For a right triangle the smallest circle that covers the whole triangle is its circumcircle, whose center is the midpoint of the hypotenuse and whose radius R equals half the hypotenuse:

R = c / 2.

Hence the possible rope lengths are

c/2 = 113/2 = 56.5 ft  (15-112-113)
c/2 = 74/2  = 37   ft  (24-70-74)
c/2 = 58/2  = 29   ft  (40-42-58)

According to the story, one student’s answer was 8 ft shorter than Mr. Collins’s, and the other’s was “a lot longer.”  
The only pair that differs by exactly 8 ft is 37 ft and 29 ft, so Mr. Collins must have used the triangle with hypotenuse 74, giving a required rope length of 37 ft.  
(The blond student had 29 ft; the other had 56.5 ft.)

206,"Mary Jane, the confectioner with two first names, looked up her fellow candy maker in the phone book.  ""Cracker, Jack"" was the listing, and during the ensuing phone conversation they decided to jointly market their products in a single multi-pack.  They quickly discovered that the normal rules of economics applied, as when they reduced their price, they were able to sell more of their product, and vice versa.
When they priced a box of candy at $5.95, they realized a profit of $1.75 per box and sold on average 100 boxes per week.
For each $0.20 reduction in price, their sales increased by 25 boxes per week.
What did they finally determine was the optimum price at which to sell their wares to produce the maximum weekly profit?
(Assume that changes in price have no effect on the cost of producing or marketing the candy.)",Form an equation which calculates profit and reflects the effects of changes in price.,"This can be solved in a few different ways.  Trial and error is one, and perhaps the simplest.  Deriving an equation for the profit produces:
P(Profit) = ($1.75-0.20x)(100+25x)
........ = -5x²-20x+43.75x+175
........ = -5x² +23.75x +175
Here, the 'x' represents the number of $0.20 reductions in price (and per-box profit), and thereby the number of 25 box sales increases that will be performed.
This produces an inverted parabola when graphed, and the point of maximum profit can be fairly accurately determined by observation.  Finally, using basic calculus, the first derivative can be obtained:
P` = -10x +23.75
To maximize Profit, find the point where the first derivative is equal to zero.
0 = -10x +23.75
10x = 23.75
x = 2.375
Therefore, the price should be reduced by 2.375 x $0.20, or $0.47 per box for an optimum price of $5.48 per box.
This yields sales of approximately 159 boxes per week, at a profit per box of $1.28 for a total weekly profit of $203.52.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

C  = cost per box  
P  = selling price  
Q  = boxes sold per week  
Π  = weekly profit  

1. Determine the constant production cost  
At the observed point  
 P = \$5.95, profit-per-box = \$1.75  
So C = 5.95 − 1.75 = \$4.20.

2. Express price and quantity as functions of the number of \$0.20 price cuts  
Let n = number of \$0.20 reductions (n may be positive, zero, or negative).

Price: P(n) = 5.95 − 0.20 n  
Quantity: Q(n) = 100 + 25 n  (each cut adds 25 boxes; a price rise, n<0, subtracts 25)

3. Write the profit function  
Profit per box = P(n) − C = (5.95 − 0.20 n) − 4.20 = 1.75 − 0.20 n

Weekly profit  
 Π(n) = [1.75 − 0.20 n] · [100 + 25 n]  
    = −5n² + 23.75n + 175.

4. Locate the maximum of the quadratic  
Vertex at n* = −b/(2a) = −23.75 / (2·−5) = 2.375.  
This gives the theoretical maximum, but n must be an integer (prices change in \$0.20 steps).

5. Check the two nearest integers  

n = 2  →  P = 5.95 − 0.40 = \$5.55  
 Π(2) = −5(2)² + 23.75(2) + 175 = \$202.50

n = 3  →  P = 5.95 − 0.60 = \$5.35  
 Π(3) = −5(3)² + 23.75(3) + 175 = \$201.25

Since \$202.50 > \$201.25, n = 2 is optimal.

6. Conclusion  
The highest weekly profit occurs when the box is priced at  

P = 5.95 − 2·0.20 = \$5.55.

207,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote an equation on a rock:
SLIDE

""Each letter in the equation represents a different digit,"" said the troll. ""The letters in the password represent 3651.""
So, what is the password?",There is some casework to be done on D; obviously we have that S = 1,"The password is LENS.
Since SL-D=3 or (SL-1)-D=3 (meaning SL-D=4), and since the highest possible sum of two different one-digit numbers is 17, S must equal 1.
Since SL=1L=10+L, D must be 6 or greater, since 6 is the lowest number that can be added to 4 to get a two-digit number.
Suppose D=6. Then L must equal 0. Since D-A (or 1D-A, but this is impossible because 16 or greater minus 5 or 6 is a two-digit number) is 5 or 6, A must equal 0 or 1. But since L=0 and S=1, this cannot work.
Suppose D=7. Then L is 0 or 1, and since S=1, L=0. A must be 1 or 2, but since S=1, A=2.
Suppose D=8. Then L is 1 or 2, and since S=1, L=2. A must be 2 or 3, but since L=2, A=3.
Suppose D=9. Then L is 2 or 3, and A is 3 or 4. Therefore, either L=2 and A=3, L=2 and A=4, or L=3 and A=4.
The only possibility for D-A=6 is D=9 and A=3. Since 1 is carried from D to E, N must equal 9, since that's the only one-digit number that can be added to 1 to get a two-digit number. But since D=9, this cannot work.
Therefore, D-A=5, and E-N=1. Since 1 could not have been carried from D to E, E cannot be 0. Since S=1, E cannot be 1. If E=2, then N=1, which cannot work because S=1. If E=3, then N=2. But if D=7, A=2. If D=8, then L=2 and A=3. If D=9, then L is either 2 or 3. So E cannot be 3.
Therefore, E is 4 or greater. Since 4+6 is a two-digit number, 1 must have been carried over from L to I, and 1L-D=4.
If D=7, then L=0. But since 10-7=3, D cannot be 7.
If D=9, then L=3 and A=4.
If E=4, then N=3. But if D=8, A=3, and if D=9, L=3 and A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=5, then since 1I-E=6, I=1. But since S=1, this cannot work.
If E=7, then I=3. But if D=8, then A=3, and if D=9, then L=3. So this cannot work.
If E=8, then I=4, and D cannot be 8. But if D=9, then A=4. So this cannot work.
If E=9, then N=8, and D cannot be 8 or 9. So this cannot work.
Therefore, E=6, N=5, and I=2. If D=8, then L=2, so D must equal 9. This means:
S=1, I=2, L=3, A=4, N=5, E=6, and D=9.
Therefore, 3651=LENS.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the subtraction be written column-wise (right–justified):

      S L I D E

Because “SLIDE” has five digits while “DEAN” has four, the actual operation is

  S L I D E
– 0 D E A N
------------
0 3 6 5 1

Thus the leading digit of the result is 0, which means the subtraction in the
thousands column had to borrow from S, so S must be 1 (the only non-zero digit
that can become 0 after a borrow).

Work the subtraction from right to left, letting any borrow from a column be
denoted by b (0 or 1).

1. Units: E – N = 1 or (E + 10) – N = 1  
   • If there is no borrow from the tens column (b₁ = 0), then E = N + 1.

2. Tens: D – A – b₁ = 5 (with a possible new borrow b₂ from the hundreds)  
   Since b₁ = 0, either
      D – A = 5 (no borrow) or D + 10 – A = 5 (b₂ = 1).

3. Hundreds: I – E – b₂ = 6 (perhaps causing another borrow b₃).

4. Thousands: L – D – b₃ must equal –7 (because ten is added after a borrow
   to leave the digit 3 and force the leading 0).  Hence  
      L + 10 – (D + b₃) = 3 ⇒ L = D – 6.

Working through the two possibilities for the tens column:

• If there is no borrow in the tens column (b₂ = 0):

   I – E = 6 or I + 10 – E = 6.

   The first possibility fails because it forces L = D – 7 and gives duplicate
   digits.  The second possibility (I + 10 – E = 6) leads to

        E = I + 4, L = D – 6, A = D – 5.

   Trying D = 8 or 9 (the only values ≥ 6 that keep digits non-negative and
   distinct) we get

        D = 9, A = 4, L = 3,
        choose N = 5 ⇒ E = 6, I = 2.

   All seven letters now have distinct digits:

        S = 1, L = 3, I = 2, D = 9, E = 6, A = 4, N = 5.

   Checking: 13296 –  9645 =  3651.  Correct.

Thus the unique solution is

        S L I D E = 13296
            D E A N =  9645

There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, neither of which is prime.  (No, 1 is not prime.)  So you will walk in an expanding square with sides of length 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 feet.  This is a total of 1060 feet.

   • A (Australia) is the 1st letter → 1 × 500 = 500  
   • P (Peru) is the 16th letter → 16 × 500 = 8 000  
   • I (India) is the 9th letter → 9 × 500 = 4 500  
   • S (Scotland) is the 19th letter → 19 × 500 = 9 500

214,"Alec, Brett and Chris each purchased parts for their skateboards at the sports store. Alec and Brett wanted to build new skateboards, so they each needed to purchase a deck, trucks, bearings and wheels. Chris only needed new wheels. The store offers a 10% discount for purchases over $250, so the boys decided to pay for all the parts together to qualify for the discount. Altogether, the boys spent $266.40. The clues below reflect the price of the items before the discount is applied.
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
They each bought the same kinds of wheels. Together they spent $75 for the 3 sets of wheels. Each set contained 4 wheels.
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his. However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
How much did each person spend?","Find the total price, then focus on each item separately","Alec spent $113.40.
Brett spent $130.50.
Chris spent $22.50.
Component Alec Brett Chris Total
Deck $50 $45 $0 $95
Trucks 35 40 $0 75
Wheels 25 25 25 75
Bearings 16 35 $0 51
Total before discount $126 $145 $25 $296
less 10% discount $12.60 $14.50 $2.50 $29.60
Amount spent $113.40 $130.50 $22.50 $266.40
Explanation:
First find the original price of all the items combined. $266.40 is the price after the 10% discount was applied.
That means $266.40 is equal to 90% of the original price.
Write an equation and then cross multiply:
266.40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x   =   9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x
The original price for all the items was $296.
Write an equation: (let the first letter of each word represent the total cost spent for that item).
D + T + W + B = 296
Given: The wheels cost $75.
D + T + W + B = 296
D + T -75 + B = 296 - 75
D + T + B = 221
The total cost of the bearings came to $24 less than the total cost of the wheels.
B = W - 24
B = 75 - 24
B = 51
The cost of all the bearings for the 2 boys combined was $1 more than the deck for Alec's skateboard.
Alec's skateboard = 51 - 1
Alec's skateboard = 50
Alec spent $5 more for his deck than Brett spent for his.
Alec spent $50. Therefore, $50 - 5 = Brett's deck
Brett's deck = $45.
However, Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.
Add the amounts known on all of the items so far and subtract from the total original cost.
Wheels: 75
Decks: 95
Bearings: 51
75 + 95 + 51 = 221
Sub total: 221
Therefore, the total amount spent on trucks was $75.
Total amount on trucks was $75. To find the amount each boy spent: use a formula or guess and check (What 2 numbers total 75, if one is 5 more than the other?)
Let x = the amount Alec spent on trucks.
x + (x+5) = 75
2x + 5 = 75
2x = 70
x = 35
Alec spent $35 on trucks. Brett spent $5 more than Alec. Therefore, Brett spent $40 on trucks.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Here, let x = the amount Alec spent on bearings.
Brett spent $3 more than twice the amount Alec spent on bearings, so write the value of Brett's bearings as 2x + 3.
Amount Alec spent + amount Brett spent = $51
x + (2x + 3) = 51
3x + 3 = 51
3x = 48
x = 16
Alec's spent $16 on bearings.
Brett spent $35 on bearings",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

Dₐ , Tₐ , Bₐ = Alec’s deck, trucks, bearings  
Dᵦ , Tᵦ , Bᵦ = Brett’s deck, trucks, bearings  

All three bought the same wheels: one set each at a price W.  
Three sets cost $75 ⇒ W = $25.

1.  Total before discount  
   They finally paid $266.40 after a 10 % discount, so the undiscounted total is  
   T = 266.40 ÷ 0.9 = $296.00.

2.  Bearings versus Alec’s deck  
   “Bearings for the 2 boys combined were $1 more than Alec’s deck.”  
   Bₐ + Bᵦ = Dₐ + 1.                                    (i)

3.  Bearings versus wheels  
   “Total bearings cost $24 less than total wheels.”  
   Bₐ + Bᵦ = 75 – 24 = 51.                              (ii)

   From (i) and (ii):  Dₐ + 1 = 51 ⇒ Dₐ = 50.

4.  Relationship between the two decks  
   “Alec’s deck is $5 more than Brett’s.”  
   50 = Dᵦ + 5 ⇒ Dᵦ = 45.

5.  Trucks  
   “Brett spent $5 more on trucks than Alec.”  
   Let Tₐ = x.  Then Tᵦ = x + 5.                       (iii)

6.  Bearings relationship  
   “Brett spent $3 more on bearings than twice Alec’s bearings.”  
   Bᵦ = 2Bₐ + 3.                                       (iv)

   Use (ii): Bₐ + Bᵦ = 51  
   ⇒ Bₐ + (2Bₐ + 3) = 51  
   ⇒ 3Bₐ = 48 ⇒ Bₐ = 16.  
   Then   Bᵦ = 2·16 + 3 = 35.

7.  Total cost equation  
   Alec’s subtotal        = Dₐ + Tₐ + Bₐ + W  
                          = 50 + x + 16 + 25 = 91 + x  

   Brett’s subtotal       = Dᵦ + Tᵦ + Bᵦ + W  
                          = 45 + (x + 5) + 35 + 25 = 110 + x  

   Chris’s subtotal       = W = 25  

   Grand total            = (91 + x) + (110 + x) + 25  
                          = 226 + 2x  

   But the grand total must be 296, so  
   226 + 2x = 296 ⇒ 2x = 70 ⇒ x = 35.

   Hence Tₐ = 35 and Tᵦ = 40.

8.  Individual totals before discount  
   Alec  : 50 + 35 + 16 + 25 = $126  
   Brett : 45 + 40 + 35 + 25 = $145  
   Chris : 25                        = $25  

   Check: 126 + 145 + 25 = 296 ✓

9.  Amount actually paid (after 10 % off)  
   Each one pays 90 % of his subtotal:

   Alec  : 0.9 × 126 = $113.40  
   Brett : 0.9 × 145 = $130.50  
   Chris : 0.9 ×  25 = $22.50  

   Sum: 113.40 + 130.50 + 22.50 = $266.40 ✓

Let c be the number of chairs produced per hour and t the number of tables produced per hour.
The number of saws limit the combination of chairs and tables to 600=10c+5t.
The number of lathes limit the combination of chairs and tables to 360=5c+5t.
The number of sanding machines limit the combination of chairs and tables to 1080=5c+20t.
Next graph these three lines. It should be expected that the answer will lie on the intersection of two of these lines or to make all chairs or all tables. The intersection of the saw and sanding machine line occurs outside of how many chairs the lathe can make so this combination is not a viable answer.

Estimate how tall the old oak tree is.","TAN A = opposite / adjacent, remember trigonometry","tree height = TAN of angle of vision  *  distance to the tree = 104.7 feet tall
First you need to figure out the angle of vision.  The angle of the line of vision over the fence, is the same angle of vision of the eye to the tree top.  Height of eyes (67 inches), height of fence (8 ft = 96 inches), distance to fence (5 ft = 60 in)
Angle of vision = inverse TAN ( (96 - 67) / 60) = 25.80 degrees
Distance to tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 2460 inches
Tree height from eye level = TAN (25.80 deg) * 2460 inches = 1189 inches
Tree height estimate = 1189 inches + 67 inches = 104.7 feet
This is an old lumberjack method of estimating a tree height.  With pure math the height of 104.7 feet is correct.  With the measurement capabilities available to any lumberjack (or any average Homer) precise measurements are not possible.  Thus the need to clarify these calculations as estimates.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1.  Put everything in feet  
   • Homer’s eyes are at 67 in = 67/12 ≈ 5.583 ft above the ground.

   • Horizontal distance eye → fence = 5 ft.  
   • Horizontal distance eye → tree = 5 ft + 200 ft = 205 ft.

2.  Find the “sight-line” slope from Homer’s eyes to the fence top  
      rise = 8 ft − 5.583 ft = 2.417 ft

1.  Telephone cascade  
   • Each call lasts 30 s.  
   • As soon as a resident finishes receiving a call, he can begin his own two calls, one after another.

   Put the moments when calls finish into 30-second “slots”:

   Slot 1 (t = 30 s): 1 person informed  
   Slot 2 (t = 60 s): 2 persons informed  
   Slot 3 (t = 90 s): 3 persons informed

   Slot 10 (t = 300 s): 89 persons informed  
   Slot 11 (t = 330 s): 144 persons informed  

   The numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, … are consecutive Fibonacci numbers (each entry is the sum of the two previous ones), because every resident can place only two sequential calls.

2.  Counting informed residents  
   After k slots the total number informed is
        1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + … + F_{k+1} = F_{k+3} – 2,
   where F_n is the n-th Fibonacci number.

   We need at least 375 residents informed:

        F_{k+3} – 2 ≥ 375  ⟹  F_{k+3} ≥ 377.

   The first Fibonacci number ≥ 377 is F_{14}=377, so k+3 = 14 and k = 11.

   Therefore every apartment has been phoned by the end of slot 11, i.e. after  
        11 × 30 s = 330 s = 5 min 30 s.

3.  Evacuation time  
   A resident who has just finished receiving the call still has to  
        • make two 30-s calls (60 s), then  
        • walk out (90 s).

   So the last residents need 60 s + 90 s = 150 s after 5 min 30 s.

4.  Total time to empty the building  
        5 min 30 s + 2 min 30 s = 8 min = 480 s.

Thus the whole building is empty 8 minutes after Dave places his first call.

Work with the ordinary “multiply-by-4” carries:

1. Units: 4D = 10k₁ + A.  
2. Tens: 4C + k₁ = 10k₂ + B.  
3. Hundreds: 4B + k₂ = 10k₃ + C.  
4. Thousands: 4A + k₃ = D.  
Here k₁,k₂,k₃ are the carries (0–3).

Bounds for A  
Because 4·N is still a 4-digit number, N ≤ 2499, so A ∈ {1,2}.

Step 1 (units)  
Equation 1 requires 4D ≡ A (mod 10).  
Since 4D can end only in 0,2,4,6,8, A cannot be 1.  
Thus A = 2 and we need 4D ≡ 2 (mod 10), giving D ∈ {3,8}.  
Check the carries:  
 D = 3 ⇒ 4·3 = 12 ⇒ k₁ = 1.  
 D = 8 ⇒ 4·8 = 32 ⇒ k₁ = 3.

Step 4 (thousands)  
Equation 4: D = 4A + k₃ = 8 + k₃.  
With D = 3 this would give k₃ = –5 (impossible), so D = 8 and k₃ = 0.  
Consequently k₁ = 3 (from above).

Step 3 (hundreds)  
4B + k₂ = C   (because k₃ = 0).  
Since k₂ ≤ 3, 4B + k₂ ≤ 9, so B can only be 0,1,2.

• B = 0 → C = k₂ (0–3).  
  Step 2 then gives 4C + 3 = 10k₂, i.e. 4k₂ + 3 = 10k₂ ⇒ 3 = 6k₂ – impossible.

• B = 1 → C = 4 + k₂.  
  Step 2: 4(4 + k₂) + 3 = 10k₂ + 1  
     19 + 4k₂ = 10k₂ + 1 ⇒ 18 = 6k₂ ⇒ k₂ = 3.  
  Hence C = 4 + 3 = 7 (valid).

All multiples of 25 end in either 00, 25, 50, or 75. The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00. The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9.
If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard. If you did know it then the problem was likely very easy. The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9. Note that this is true for 3 also. For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9.
To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde. This number can be expressed as follows.
a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .
9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.

1. Divisibility by 25  
   A decimal number is divisible by 25 iff its last two digits are 00, 25, 50 or 75.  
   Because every digit we may use is 0 or 1, the only possible ending is 00.  
   ⇒ the number must end in 00.

2. Divisibility by 9  
   A decimal number is divisible by 9 iff the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.  
   Our digits can only be 0 or 1, so this sum equals the number of 1-digits that appear.

3. Counting the 1’s  
   Let the number have L digits.  
   It starts with 1, ends with 00, so there are (L–3) “free” middle digits, each 0 or 1.  
   Total number of 1’s = 1 + (number of 1’s among the L–3 middle digits).

   We need 1 + (number of middle 1’s) ≡ 0 (mod 9).

   The smallest positive multiple of 9 that this total can equal is 9 itself, so
        1 + (number of middle 1’s) = 9  ⇒  number of middle 1’s = 8.

4. Shortest possible length  
   To house 8 middle 1’s we need at least 8 middle positions:
        L – 3 ≥ 8  ⇒  L ≥ 11.
   For L < 11 the total number of 1’s is at most 1 + 7 = 8, never reaching 9,
   so length 11 is the minimum.

5. Form of the minimal number  
   With length 11 and 8 required middle 1’s, every middle digit must be 1.

   Thus the unique candidate is
        1 11111111 00   (eleven digits)

   i.e. 11 111 111 100.

6. Verification  
   • Ends with 00  ⇒ divisible by 25.  
     11 111 111 100 ÷ 25 = 444 444 444.  
   • Sum of digits = 9  ⇒ divisible by 9.

2. p ≡ 4 (mod 5)  (“1 less than a multiple of 5”, since 4 ≡ −1 (mod 5))

Step 1. Solve the system of congruences.
The moduli 4 and 5 are coprime, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem there is a unique solution modulo 20 (= lcm(4, 5)).  
List the numbers 0–19 that are 1 mod 4: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17.  
Among these, check which are 4 mod 5: only 9 works.

N, 2N and 3N are all three–digit,
none of their nine digits is 0, and
taken together the nine digits are the digits 1–9, each appearing exactly once.

Step 1   Where can N lie?
For 3N to be three–digit we need 3N ≤ 999, hence N ≤ 333, while of course N ≥ 100.
Thus 100 ≤ N ≤ 333.

Step 2   N must be a multiple of 3.
Because the nine digits 1–9 add up to 45, the sum of all the digits in N, 2N, 3N is 45, which is divisible by 9.  A number and the sum of its digits are congruent mod 9, so
N + 2N + 3N = 6N ≡ 45 ≡ 0 (mod 9)  ⇒  6N is divisible by 9  ⇒  N is divisible by 3.

So we need only test multiples of 3 in the range 100–333.

Step 3   Quick filters that remove almost every multiple of 3.
•  A valid N can contain no 0 and no repeated digit (for otherwise some digit would have to be repeated in the whole collection).
•  The same is true for 2N and 3N.
•  The three numbers must have pairwise disjoint digit–sets.

1.  When do the two clocks read the same?

The reading difference grows at  
(1 min + 2 min) / h = 3 min per real hour.

After each bounce it rises to 2/3 of the previous height and then falls the same distance.  
So every rebound height is counted twice (up and down).

Let the initial height be H = 9 ft.  
Rebound heights form a geometric sequence:

H·(2/3), H·(2/3)², H·(2/3)³, …

Sum of all rebound heights (one direction):

S = H·(2/3) + H·(2/3)² + H·(2/3)³ + …  
  = 9 · [(2/3)/(1 − 2/3)]  
  = 9 · [(2/3)/(1/3)]  
  = 9 · 2  
  = 18 ft.

Total distance traveled  
Initial drop: 9 ft  
Up-and-down for rebounds: 2·S = 2·18 = 36 ft  

Total = 9 + 36 = 45 ft.

242,"We were all celebrating the 25th birthday of my beloved sister, Lavi the kindhearted Romankachi. She was younger to me Rudy the business-minded Romankachi by two years and to our elder brother Fred the well-settled Romankachi by four years. Just as the celebrations were in full swing, I realized something about our ages. I found that I could say at least two things definitely about each of the following two integer values formed by manipulating our ages taken as integers:-
a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
Though I forgot about this the next moment and got busy enjoying myself, could you tell what were the two things that flashed across my mind.
Consider all ages to be integer values. Also during any given year, Lavi was exactly two years younger to me and exactly four years younger to Fred.",I'm exactly two years elder to Lavi and exactly two years younger to Fred.,"a) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Lavi's and my age considered during any one year right since she was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is the square of a number 1 less than my age in that year.
Example: When Lavi was 3, I was  5 -> (3*5)+1 gives 16 which is the square of 4, which is 1 less than my age(5) in that year.
b) The number formed by adding 1 to the product of Fred's and my ages considered during any one year right since I was a year old.
The two things that I could definitely say about the above integer value are :-
1) It is a perfect square.
2) The number formed is square of a number 1 more than my age in that year.
Example: when I was 6, Fred was    8-> (6*8)+1 gives 49 which is the square of 7, a number 1 more than my age(6) in that year.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let L , R , F denote, in some particular year,

 L = Lavi’s age   R = my (Rudy’s) age   F = Fred’s age.

Because the differences in our ages never change we always have  
 R = L + 2  and  F = R + 2 = L + 4.

-------------------------------------------------
a)  Number  (L · R) + 1
-------------------------------------------------
(L · R) + 1 = L(L + 2) + 1  
        = L² + 2L + 1  
        = (L + 1)².

Thus, no matter which year is chosen (L ≥ 1):

1. The value is a perfect square – it equals (L + 1)².  
2. Since every perfect square larger than 1 is composite, the value is certainly not prime.

(The square root, L + 1, is in fact the integer exactly halfway between Lavi’s and my ages.)

-------------------------------------------------
b)  Number  (F · R) + 1
-------------------------------------------------
Because F = R + 2 we get

(F · R) + 1 = R(R + 2) + 1  
       = R² + 2R + 1  
       = (R + 1)².

Again, for every possible year (R ≥ 1):

1. The value is a perfect square – it equals (R + 1)².  
2. Being a perfect square exceeding 1, it is definitely composite and hence never prime.

(The square root, R + 1, is the integer exactly halfway between Fred’s and my ages.)

-------------------------------------------------
So the two facts that can always be stated with certainty about each of the two numbers are:

• It is a perfect square (its square root is an integer lying midway between the two ages involved).  
• Consequently, it is composite – it can never be a prime number.

Final answer: Each number is always a perfect square, and therefore always composite (never prime).",True

Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn

247,"The other day I was surprised by the sudden arrival of my friend Tweeto. He had arrived that morning after a long and arduous journey by train. Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.
He said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.
These were his observations :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
He wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).
It didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?","Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations","The observations given are :-
1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.
2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.
3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.
4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.
From observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.
Let us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.
From observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.
Hence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.
If it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.
This means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.
Now the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number. Hence, the figure for Maver should be 3.
Listing all these figures we have
(1st column is Station, 2nd is Getting down, 3rd is Getting in)
Maver 3 6
Willow 13 26
Wonderland 23 46
Doku 37 74
Lemp 47 94
Rudolf 59 118
Total 182 364
Given that the number of people when the train chugged into Rudolf is 227, the number of people including Tweeto in the train before it reached Maver =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Net number of people who got in at the six stations) =
(Number of people in the train at Rudolf) - (Number of people who got in at the six stations - Number of people who got out at the six stations) =

P₀ = passengers on the train before it reached Maver (what we are after).  
Pₖ = passengers after leaving the k-th station (k = 1 … 5).  
When the train arrives at Rudolf (the 6-th station) it is still
carrying P₅ passengers; we are told P₅ = 227.

1. “Twice as many got in as got down”: Iₖ = 2Oₖ  for every k.  
2. The Oₖ ’s are prime numbers taken from the intervals  
   (0,10], (10,20], (20,30], (30,40], (40,50], (50,60] respectively.
3. |I_{k+1} – Iₖ| ≥ 20   ⇒   |O_{k+1} – Oₖ| ≥ 10.  
4. ΣOₖ is even.  
5. Pₖ = P_{k-1} + Oₖ   (because P_{k-1} − Oₖ + 2Oₖ = P_{k-1}+Oₖ).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – choose the only possible set of Oₖ ’s
-------------------------------------------------
Start with O₁ (prime 3,5 or 7 – 2 is excluded by condition 4).

O₁ = 3  
For Willow we need a prime at least 10 away: O₂ ∈ {13,17,19}.  
If O₂ = 13, then for Wonderland we need |O₃−13| ≥ 10 ⇒ O₃ ∈ {23,29}.  
• O₃ = 23 is tentatively possible.  
• O₃ = 29 will soon be shown impossible.

Now check the next gap to Doku (primes 31,37):  
|31−23| = 8  (too small)  
|37−23| = 14 (OK) → O₄ must be 37.

Going on, for Lemp (41,43,47) we need |O₅−37| ≥ 10  
→ O₅ must be 47.  

For Rudolf (53,59) we need |O₆−47| ≥ 10  
→ O₆ must be 59.  

Thus one coherent chain is

O₁ = 3,  O₂ = 13,  O₃ = 23,  O₄ = 37,  O₅ = 47,  O₆ = 59.

All other tentative starts break down (because O₃=29 makes the next
difference too small, or earlier differences violate |O_{k+1}–O_k| ≥ 10).
Therefore the above chain is unique.

Condition 4 (even total) is satisfied:
3+13+23+37+47+59 = 182 (even).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – compute P₀
-------------------------------------------------
P₅ (arrival at Rudolf) is given: P₅ = 227.  
But  
P₅ = P₀ + (O₁+O₂+O₃+O₄+O₅)  
   = P₀ + (3+13+23+37+47)  
   = P₀ + 123.

Hence   227 = P₀ + 123  ⇒  P₀ = 104.

So 104 passengers were on the train (including Tweeto) before it
reached Maver station.

What time is it?",What is the rate of travel of each hand on a clock?,"2:24 The hour hand makes an angle of 72 degrees while the minute hand makes an angle of 144 degrees.

The final position of the minute hand will be:
x/30 min * 180 degrees

0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.

These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.

Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.

Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.

Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3

There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.

Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1

DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61

The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D

If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)

a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) is the first digit and  
b (0 ≤ b < 10^{k-1}) is the block of the remaining k–1 digits (leading zeros allowed).

Rotating N to the left moves a to the units place:

  R = b·10 + a.

According to the problem, R = 3/2 · N, i.e. 2R = 3N.  Substitute the expressions for R and N:

 2(b·10 + a) = 3(a·10^{k-1} + b)

 20b + 2a = 3a·10^{k-1} + 3b

 17b = a(3·10^{k-1} – 2).  (1)

Because 17 is prime and a ≤ 9, a and 17 are coprime, so (1) implies

 3·10^{k-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).  (2)

Multiply both sides of (2) by the inverse of 3 modulo 17 (which is 6), obtaining

 10^{k-1} ≡ 12 (mod 17).  (3)

The first occurrence of residue 12 is at exponent 15; hence k–1 = 15 and

 k = 16.

So the required number must have 16 digits.

 (3·10^{15} – 2)/17 = 176 470 588 235 294.  (Call this value Q.)

Equation (1) gives b = a·Q.  To keep b < 10^{15}, the largest allowable a is 5, but the smallest (and thus minimizing N) is a = 1, which yields

 b = Q = 176 470 588 235 294.

Therefore

 N = a·10^{15} + b  
   = 1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294  
   = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

Check:

Rotate left: 1 764 705 882 352 941.  
Multiply N by 1.5: 1 176 470 588 235 294 × 3/2 = 1 764 705 882 352 941.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the six–digit number be

Each pair AB, CD, EF must be a two–digit prime, so EF itself is a two–digit prime.  
Hence E ≠ 0, 4, 5, 6, 8 and F ∈ {1,3,7,9}.  
Moreover EF ≤ 54 (the greatest possible digit–sum) gives E ≤ 5.  
Examine the possible values of E one by one.

1.  E = 1  
 EF can be 13 or 17 (F = 3 or 7).  
 (★) gives C+D = 8−F: 5 (if F=3) or 1 (if F=7).  
 Neither 5 nor 1 can be obtained with two unused digits distinct from 1 or F,

2.  E = 2  
 EF can be 23 or 29 (F = 3 or 9).

  The only unordered pairs of distinct digits summing to 13 are

  The only prime obtainable is 67, so CD = 67 (C=6, D=7).

  Digits used so far: 2,3,6,7.  
  We still need AB prime with A+B = E+F = 5 and A,B new.  
  The pairs summing to 5 are {1,4} and {4,1}; 41 is prime, 14 is not.

 b) F = 9  Then C+D = 16−9 = 7.  
  Trying every possible CD and AB (with A+B = 11) shows that AB cannot
  be prime, so F=9 is impossible.

3.  E = 3  
 EF prime forces F = 1 or 7 (31 or 37).
 For F = 1, (★) gives C+D = 23 (>17) – impossible.  
 For F = 7, (★) gives C+D = 17, which forces CD = 89 (prime).  
 But A+B has to be 10, and no two unused digits can form a prime with that

4.  E = 4 or 5

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True

Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing a line segment from each vertex to the incenter. The areas of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2. Thus, A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx.
We use Heron`s formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""
""The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.""
Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",The sum cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. Think about what information is provided by each character knowing and/or not knowing the numbers.,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""

Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the two integers (each larger than 1) be  

x ≤ y,   
S = x+y (the sum told to Sachin),   
P = xy (the product told to Prashant).

Only the words spoken in the dining–room are public; everybody is a perfect logician and everybody knows that everybody is a perfect logician.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  What Sachin’s first sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Sachin, who knows only S, says

 “I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

He is asserting two things:

(i)  He himself cannot know the pair (obvious, because at least two different
     unordered pairs add up to the same S), and

(ii) He is certain that Prashant, who knows only P, cannot know the pair either.

The second point is the informative one.  
If an ordered pair (a,b) with a+b=S happens to have a product that can be
obtained in only one way from two integers larger than 1 (i.e. the product is the
product of two primes, possibly equal), then a holder of that product would at
once know the pair.  Sachin is therefore telling the others:

(*)  For every decomposition S = a + b  (a,b > 1) the product ab has at least
     two different factor pairs larger than 1.

We call such a sum an admissible sum.  
Let G be the set of admissible sums.

Simple tests give immediately two kinds of sums that are not admissible:

•  S=2+q with q prime (the pair {2,q} would give the unique factorisation
   2·q);

•  S even with S/2 prime (the pair {p,p} (p prime) would give the unique
   factorisation p·p).

All admissible sums must avoid those two patterns.

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  What Prashant’s sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Prashant had not known the numbers at first (his product P possessed at least
two different factorisations), but after hearing (*), he says

 “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

So, among all the unordered factor pairs of his product P,

 P = u·v  (u ≤ v, u,v > 1),

exactly one pair {u,v} has a sum that lies in G.  
If two different factor pairs had sums in G, Prashant could still not tell which
of them was the correct pair.  Thus

(**)  For Prashant’s actual product P there is exactly one factor pair whose
      sum belongs to G.

A product with this property will be called a decisive product.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  What Sachin’s second sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Sachin now hears that Prashant has a decisive product.  
Since Sachin knows the very sum S, he examines all unordered pairs {a,b}
with a+b=S.  If more than one of their products were decisive, he would not yet
know which pair is the correct one.  But he says

 “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

So

(***)  Among all pairs with sum S, exactly one of the products is decisive.

Any S with this property will be called a determining sum.

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  What Nakul’s sentence tells us
────────────────────────────────────────
Nakul knows only the public words.  After hearing Sachin’s last remark he
says

 “Now I also know the numbers.”

Hence, in the whole universe of possibilities there must be exactly ONE pair
{ x , y } that fulfils the three conditions (*)–(***) above; otherwise Nakul
could not be certain which pair had been meant.

────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Hunting for such a pair
────────────────────────────────────────
The usual way to search is to list complete sets of sums and products,
but here logical elimination is enough and no brute force is necessary.

Step 1:  restrict the sums  
We have already seen that admissible sums cannot be of the form p+2 with p
prime, nor of the form 2p with p prime.  The smallest admissible sums are

 11, 17, 23, 27, …

Step 2:  look for decisive products  
For every admissible sum S one inspects its products and checks whether
exactly one factor pair gives a sum lying again in G.  A little inspection shows

 • S=11 has two different pairs, 2+9 and 3+8, whose products
   (18 and 24) are both decisive ⇒ S=11 is NOT determining.

 • S=17 has only the pair 4+13 whose product 52 is decisive.
  (The six other pairs belonging to S=17 all yield products that are not
   decisive.)

 • S=23 has at least two pairs (2+21 and 4+19) with decisive products
   (42 and 76) ⇒ S=23 is NOT determining.

All larger admissible sums behave like 23: they give at least two decisive
products and therefore cannot be determining.  Hence

 S = 17 is the unique determining sum.

Step 3:  decide the pair for S=17  
The unordered pairs with sum 17 and their products are

 2+15 → 30    3+14 → 42    4+13 → 52  
 5+12 → 60    6+11 → 66    7+10 → 70    8+9 → 72

Among those products only 52 is decisive (for 52 the factorisations are
2·26 and 4·13; 2+26 = 28 is NOT in G, 4+13 = 17 is in G).  
Therefore, by (***), Sachin can single out the pair

 x = 4, y = 13.

Step 4:  uniqueness for Nakul  
We have proved that there is exactly one determining sum, S=17, and that
within that sum there is exactly one pair that fits the whole conversation,
namely {4,13}.  Consequently Nakul, who has followed the same reasoning,
is also able to announce the numbers.

────────────────────────────────────────
Conclusion
────────────────────────────────────────
The only pair of integers larger than 1 that allows all four sentences to be
uttered truthfully is

 4 and 13.

10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let

Night-time divisions

1.  First man  
     N = 5a + 1 (gives 1 to the monkey, keeps a, 4a remain).

2.  Second man  
     4a = 5b + 1 (gives 1, keeps b, 4b remain).

Morning division

6.  4e = 5k (the five equal, exact morning shares).

Start at the end and work backwards.

Step 6 4e = 5k  ⇒ e = 5k/4.  
For e to be integral, 5k must be divisible by 4, so put k = 4m (m ∈ ℤ⁺), giving e = 5m.

Step 5 4d = 5e + 1 = 25m + 1  ⇒ d = (25m + 1)/4.  
25m + 1 ≡ m + 1 (mod 4); divisibility demands m ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Write m = 4n + 3; then d = 25n + 19.

Step 4 4c = 5d + 1 = 5(25n + 19) + 1 = 125n + 96  
   ⇒ c = (125n + 96)/4.  
Since 125n + 96 ≡ n (mod 4), we need n ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Put n = 4p; then c = 125p + 24.

Step 3 4b = 5c + 1 = 5(125p + 24) + 1 = 625p + 121  
   ⇒ b = (625p + 121)/4.  
Because 625p + 121 ≡ p + 1 (mod 4), require p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  
Let p = 4q + 3; then b = 625q + 499.

Step 2 4a = 5b + 1 = 5(625q + 499) + 1 = 3125q + 2496  
   ⇒ a = (3125q + 2496)/4.  
Now 3125q + 2496 ≡ q (mod 4); hence q ≡ 0 (mod 4).  
Set q = 4r (r ≥ 0); then a = 3125r + 624.

Finally, Step 1 gives the original total

 N = 5a + 1 = 5(3125r + 624) + 1 = 15625r + 3121.

Thus every solution is

 N = 3121 + 15625 r  (r = 0, 1, 2, …).

To obtain the least possible positive pile, take r = 0:

 Nmin = 3121.

Verification with 3121

• 3121 = 5·624 + 1 → give 1, keep 624, 2496 remain.  
• 2496 = 5·499 + 1 → give 1, keep 499, 1996 remain.  
• 1996 = 5·399 + 1 → give 1, keep 399, 1596 remain.  
• 1596 = 5·319 + 1 → give 1, keep 319, 1276 remain.  
• 1276 = 5·255 + 1 → give 1, keep 255, 1020 remain.  
• 1020 = 5·204       (exact final division).

All conditions are met, and any smaller number is impossible by the derivation above.

Now if you add the operations square root, factorial, and exponent, what is the first number counting up from zero that can't be formed? How can each number be formed?
You may use parentheses, but you may not combine fours to make 44 or 444.

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
