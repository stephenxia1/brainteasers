{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Hint: To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.", "Hint": "To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.\nRoutes to an adjacent village (A to B):\nTo determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.\nThe farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.\nThe next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.\nThe next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.\nThe next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.\nThere are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.\nRoutes to the second village along the coast (A to C):\nA = 1\nAFi = A = 1\nFi = AFi = 1\nAi = A + AFi = 2\nABi = Ai + A = 3\nM and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nM = Ai + Fi = 3\nB = A + ABi = 4\nBi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBi = B + ABi + M = 10\nDi = M = 3\nBCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:\nBCi = B + Bi = 14\nCDi = Di = 3\nCi = BCi + CDi + M = 20\nC = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41\nThere are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.\nRoutes to the opposite village (A to D):\nSince the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.\nA = 1\nF, B = A = 1\nFAi, ABi = A + B = 2\nAi = A + ABi + FAi = 5\nFi, Bi = ABi + B = 3\nEFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4\nM, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:\nM = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11\nE, C = B + BCi = 5\nEi, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20\nDEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25\nDi = M + CDi + DEi = 61\nD = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121\nThere are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.\nBonus Question:\nThe longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:\nA-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D\nand the mirror route\nA-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D\n(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)\nIf the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.\nThe path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.\nThe paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is\n5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\nSo the total distance traveled is\n10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

There are 5 ones.\nSo, $S(9304) = 5$.\n\nUsing the formula $f(n) = L(n) + S(n)$:\n$f(9304) = L(9304) + S(9304) = 14 + 5 = 19$.\n\nFinal verification of the binary conversion of 9304:\n$10010001011000_2 = 1 \\cdot 2^{13} + 0 \\cdot 2^{12} + 0 \\cdot 2^{11} + 1 \\cdot 2^{10} + 0 \\cdot 2^9 + 0 \\cdot 2^8 + 0 \\cdot 2^7 + 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 0 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0$\n$= 2^{13} + 2^{10} + 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^3$\n$= 8192 + 1024 + 64 + 16 + 8$\n$= 9216 + 64 + 16 + 8$\n$= 9280 + 16 + 8$\n$= 9296 + 8$\n$= 9304$.\nThe binary conversion is correct. The length $L(9304)=14$ and the number of 1s $S(9304)=5$ are correct.\nThe result $f(9304) = 14+5=19$ is therefore correct based on the derived formula.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{19}}$.", "Status": true}

For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}
{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Hint: A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, defined as $s = (a+b+c)/2$.\n\nWe want to find the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius, denoted by $r$) and the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius, denoted by $R$). The hint suggests using the area of the triangle.\n\n1.  **Finding the inradius ($r$)**\n\n    Let $I$ be the incenter of the triangle $ABC$ (the center of the inscribed circle). The inscribed circle is tangent to the sides $a, b, c$. The distance from $I$ to each side is $r$.\n    We can divide the triangle $ABC$ into three smaller triangles: $\\triangle IBC$, $\\triangle ICA$, and $\\triangle IAB$.\n    The base of $\\triangle IBC$ is $a$, and its height is $r$. So, the area of $\\triangle IBC$ is $(1/2)ar$.\n    The base of $\\triangle ICA$ is $b$, and its height is $r$. So, the area of $\\triangle ICA$ is $(1/2)br$.\n    The base of $\\triangle IAB$ is $c$, and its height is $r$. So, the area of $\\triangle IAB$ is $(1/2)cr$.\n\n    The area of the triangle $ABC$, $\\mathcal{A}$, is the sum of the areas of these three triangles:\n    $\\mathcal{A} = \\text{Area}(\\triangle IBC) + \\text{Area}(\\triangle ICA) + \\text{Area}(\\triangle IAB)$\n    $\\mathcal{A} = (1/2)ar + (1/2)br + (1/2)cr$\n    $\\mathcal{A} = (1/2)(a+b+c)r$\n\n    By definition, the semiperimeter $s = (a+b+c)/2$. So, $a+b+c = 2s$.\n    Substituting this into the area formula:\n    $\\mathcal{A} = (1/2)(2s)r = sr$\n\n    From this relationship, we can express the inradius $r$ as:\n    $r = \\mathcal{A}/s$\n\n    This formula expresses the inradius in terms of the area and semiperimeter of the triangle. The area $\\mathcal{A}$ can be found using Heron's formula if side lengths $a,b,c$ are known: $\\mathcal{A} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$. Or, if two sides and the included angle are known (e.g., sides $b,c$ and angle $A$), $\\mathcal{A} = (1/2)bc \\sin A$.\n\n2.  **Finding the circumradius ($R$)**\n\n    Let $O$ be the circumcenter of the triangle $ABC$ (the center of the circumscribed circle). The circumscribed circle passes through all three vertices $A, B, C$. The distance from $O$ to each vertex is $R$.\n\n    A standard result relating the circumradius to the sides and angles of a triangle is the extended Law of Sines:\n    $a/\\sin A = b/\\sin B = c/\\sin C = 2R$\n    From this, we can write $R = a/(2\\sin A)$. (Similarly, $R = b/(2\\sin B)$ or $R = c/(2\\sin C)$).\n\n    To incorporate the area of the triangle, as suggested by the hint, we use another standard formula for the area of a triangle:\n    $\\mathcal{A} = (1/2)bc \\sin A$\n    From this formula, we can express $\\sin A$ as:\n    $\\sin A = 2\\mathcal{A}/(bc)$\n\n    Now, substitute this expression for $\\sin A$ into the formula $R = a/(2\\sin A)$:\n    $R = a / (2 \\times (2\\mathcal{A}/(bc)))$\n    $R = a / (4\\mathcal{A}/(bc))$\n    $R = abc/(4\\mathcal{A})$\n\n    This formula expresses the circumradius in terms of the side lengths and the area of the triangle.\n\nSummary of the formulas:\nLet $a,b,c$ be the side lengths, $s = (a+b+c)/2$ be the semiperimeter, and $\\mathcal{A}$ be the area of the triangle.\nThe radius of the inscribed circle (inradius) is $r = \\mathcal{A}/s$.\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius) is $R = abc/(4\\mathcal{A})$.\n\nThese derivations show how the area of the triangle can be used to find the inradius and circumradius, as per the hint.\n\nFinal Answer:\nLet $a, b, c$ be the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\nLet $s = (a+b+c)/2$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle.\nLet $A$ be the area of the triangle.\n\nThe radius of the inscribed circle (inradius), denoted by $r$, is given by the formula:\n$r = A/s$\n\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius), denoted by $R$, is given by the formula:\n$R = abc/(4A)$", "Status": true}

For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Hint: You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

{"ID": 10, "Question": "Question: After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.\nHowever, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.\nThe second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.\nWhen the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.\nWhat is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?\n Hint: The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.\nOf course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.", "Hint": "The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly.

This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:\nF = (N5)/5\nN5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1\nN4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1\nN3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1\nN2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1\nN1 = 4(N)/5 - 1\nF is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

At this moment, Al and Ben are at the same position, let's call it $x=0$.\nThe train moves in a certain direction, let's say the positive x direction. So its front is at $x=0$ at $t=0$, and its back is at $x=-L$ at $t=0$.\nThe position of the back of the train at time $t$ is $x_{tb}(t) = v_t t - L$.\n\nAl's situation:\nAl walks in the opposite direction of the train. So Al walks in the negative x direction. His speed is $v_w$.\nAl's position at time $t$ is $x_A(t) = -v_w t$.\nAl stops walking when the back of the train passes him. Let this time be $t_A$.\nAt time $t_A$, Al's position is $x_A(t_A) = -v_w t_A$.\nThe problem states that Al walks exactly 30 feet. So, $d_A = v_w t_A = 30$ feet.\nThus, Al's final position is $x_A(t_A) = -30$ feet.\nAt this time $t_A$, the back of the train is at Al's position:\n$x_{tb}(t_A) = x_A(t_A)$\n$v_t t_A - L = -30$.\nWe can express $t_A$ in terms of $v_w$: $t_A = 30/v_w$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$v_t (30/v_w) - L = -30$.\n$30 (v_t/v_w) - L = -30$.\n$L = 30 (v_t/v_w) + 30$.\nLet $k = v_t/v_w$ be the ratio of the train's speed to the walking speed.\nSo, $L = 30k + 30 = 30(k+1)$. (Equation 1)\n\nBen's situation:\nBen walks in the same direction as the train. So Ben walks in the positive x direction. His speed is $v_w$.\nBen's position at time $t$ is $x_B(t) = v_w t$.\nBen stops walking when the back of the train passes him. Let this time be $t_B$.\nAt time $t_B$, Ben's position is $x_B(t_B) = v_w t_B$.\nThe problem states that Ben walks exactly 45 feet. So, $d_B = v_w t_B = 45$ feet.\nThus, Ben's final position is $x_B(t_B) = 45$ feet.\nAt this time $t_B$, the back of the train is at Ben's position:\n$x_{tb}(t_B) = x_B(t_B)$\n$v_t t_B - L = 45$.\nWe can express $t_B$ in terms of $v_w$: $t_B = 45/v_w$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$v_t (45/v_w) - L = 45$.\n$45 (v_t/v_w) - L = 45$.\nUsing $k = v_t/v_w$:\n$45k - L = 45$.\n$L = 45k - 45 = 45(k-1)$. (Equation 2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $L$ and $k$:\n1) $L = 30(k+1)$\n2) $L = 45(k-1)$\n\nEquating the expressions for $L$:\n$30(k+1) = 45(k-1)$.\n$30k + 30 = 45k - 45$.\nSubtract $30k$ from both sides:\n$30 = 15k - 45$.\nAdd 45 to both sides:\n$30 + 45 = 15k$.\n$75 = 15k$.\n$k = 75/15 = 5$.\n\nSo, the ratio of the train's speed to the walking speed is 5 ($v_t = 5v_w$).\nFor the back of the train to pass Ben, who is moving in the same direction, the train must be faster than Ben ($v_t > v_w$, so $k>1$). Our result $k=5$ is consistent with this.\n\nNow substitute $k=5$ into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find $L$.\nUsing Equation 1: $L = 30(k+1) = 30(5+1) = 30(6) = 180$.\nUsing Equation 2: $L = 45(k-1) = 45(5-1) = 45(4) = 180$.\nBoth equations yield $L=180$ feet.\n\nAlternative method using relative speeds:\nFor Al: Al moves in the opposite direction to the train. The relative speed at which the back of the train approaches Al is $v_t + v_w$. The time Al walks is $t_A$. During this time, the entire length of the train passes Al. So, $L = (v_t+v_w)t_A$. Since Al walks 30 feet at speed $v_w$, $t_A = 30/v_w$.\nSo, $L = (v_t+v_w)(30/v_w) = (v_t/v_w + 1)30 = (k+1)30$. This is Equation 1.\n\nFor Ben: Ben moves in the same direction as the train. The relative speed at which the back of the train approaches Ben (catches up to Ben) is $v_t - v_w$. The time Ben walks is $t_B$. During this time, the entire length of the train passes Ben. So, $L = (v_t-v_w)t_B$. Since Ben walks 45 feet at speed $v_w$, $t_B = 45/v_w$.\nSo, $L = (v_t-v_w)(45/v_w) = (v_t/v_w - 1)45 = (k-1)45$. This is Equation 2.\n\nThese are the same equations obtained earlier, leading to $L=180$ feet.\n\nA third way to solve for $L$ and $k$:\nFrom $L = 30(k+1)$, we have $L/30 = k+1$, so $k = L/30 - 1$.\nFrom $L = 45(k-1)$, we have $L/45 = k-1$, so $k = L/45 + 1$.\nEquating the expressions for $k$:\n$L/30 - 1 = L/45 + 1$.\n$L/30 - L/45 = 2$.\nTo eliminate denominators, multiply by the least common multiple of 30 and 45, which is 90:\n$90(L/30) - 90(L/45) = 90(2)$.\n$3L - 2L = 180$.\n$L = 180$.\nThe length of the train is 180 feet.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{180}}$.", "Status": true}

Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.\n\"That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.\nFunny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?\"\nBill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?\n Hint: 1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Hint": "1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

(mod 11).\nLet's verify 10! (mod 11):\n10! = 3,628,800.\nTo find 3,628,800 mod 11, we can use the alternating sum of digits:\n0 - 0 + 8 - 8 + 2 - 6 + 3 = -1.\nSo, 3,628,800 \u2261 -1 (mod 11).\nThis confirms that -1 (mod 11) is indeed the value of 10!

The hint essentially confirms this relationship but does not change the method for finding k.\n\nThe minimum number of eggs is 25201.\n\nFinal check of conditions for N=25201:\nN-1 = 25200.\n25200 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 because 25200 = 10 \u00d7 2520 and 2520 is the LCM of these numbers.

We know $\\log_{10}(7) \\approx 0.8451$ and $\\log_{10}(8) = 3 \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 3 \\times 0.30103 = 0.90309$.\nSince $0.8451 < 0.851 < 0.90309$, we know that $7 < 10^{0.851} < 8$.\nUsing linear interpolation: $10^{0.851} \\approx 7 + \\frac{0.851 - 0.8451}{0.90309 - 0.8451}(8-7) = 7 + \\frac{0.0059}{0.05799} \\approx 7 + 0.10174 \\approx 7.10174$.\nSo, $R \\approx 100 \\times 7.10174 = 710.174$.\nUsing a calculator for $(\\frac{2187}{2048})^{100}$, we get approximately $710.980085$.\nRounding $710.980085$ to the nearest 10:\nThe number is between $710$ and $720$.\nThe distance to $710$ is $|710.980085 - 710| = 0.980085$.\nThe distance to $720$ is $|710.980085 - 720| = |-9.019915| = 9.019915$.\nSince $0.980085 < 9.019915$, the number $710.980085$ is closer to $710$.\nSo, rounding to the nearest 10, $3^{700}$ is approximately 710 times greater than $2^{1100}$.\n\nFinal answer: $3^{700}$ is greater than $2^{1100}$. $3^{700}$ is approximately 710 times greater than $2^{1100}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3^{700} \\text{ is greater. It is approximately 710 times greater.}}$", "Status": true}

So the digits are $(a, b, 0)$, where $a \\ne b$ and $a,b \\ne 0$.\nThe possible permutations of these digits are $ab0, a0b, ba0, b0a, 0ab, 0ba$.\nTo be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0. So, $0ab$ (which is $10a+b$) and $0ba$ (which is $10b+a$) are not three-digit numbers.\nThe three-digit numbers that can be formed are $100a+10b$, $100a+b$, $100b+10a$, $100b+a$.\nThere are only 4 distinct three-digit numbers possible (e.g., for digits $1,2,0$, the numbers are $120, 102, 210, 201$).\nSince we need five distinct three-digit numbers, this case is not possible.\nTherefore, none of the digits $a,b,c$ can be 0.

This matches our assumed value $P=10$.\nSo, this is a valid set of digits: $\\{1,2,7\\}$.\nThe 6 numbers formed by these digits are $127, 172, 217, 271, 712, 721$.\n$N_{out}=217$ is one of these numbers.\nThe five numbers that sum to 2003 are these 6 numbers excluding 217: $\\{127, 172, 271, 712, 721\\}$.\nLet's verify their sum: $127+172+271+712+721 = 2003$. This is correct.\n\nCase 2: $P=11$.\n$N_{out} = 222(11) - 2003 = 2442 - 2003 = 439$.\nThe digits of $N_{out}$ are $\\{4,3,9\\}$.\nThese digits are distinct and non-zero.\nLet's check their sum: $4+3+9 = 16$.\nThis sum (16) must be equal to $P$ (11). Since $16 \\ne 11$, this case is not a solution.\n\nCase 3: $P=12$.\n$N_{out} = 222(12) - 2003 = 2664 - 2003 = 661$.\nThe digits of $N_{out}$ are $\\{6,6,1\\}$.\nThese digits are not distinct. This contradicts our finding that the three digits $a,b,c$ must be distinct in order to form 6 (and therefore 5) distinct numbers. So this case is not a solution.\n\nCase 4: $P=13$.\n$N_{out} = 222(13) - 2003 = 2886 - 2003 = 883$.\nThe digits of $N_{out}$ are $\\{8,8,3\\}$.\nThese digits are not distinct. So this case is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only possible set of digits is $\\{1,2,7\\}$. The sum of these digits is $P=10$.\nThe six numbers formed by these digits are $127, 172, 217,", "Status": true}

No matter what your opponent does in response, you'll still expect at least a given amount in the long run.\n(2) Since the game is symmetric and open, every player will have the same best strategy -- and the same expected payoff if they use it.\n(3) Since the game is zero-sum, that expected payoff must be zero.\n(4) Given the payoff structure, the best grand (overall) strategy will involve all three choices.\nWith these principles, we can now look for a strategy that gives an expected payoff of zero, regardless of what the opponent does.  Granted, if we *knew* the opponent was playing some other strategy, we could change to get an advantage -- but getting the best stable payoff includes the assumption that the opponent will take advantage of any exposed weakness.\nSo, we're looking to mix our \"throws\" in some useful proportion that will give us a stable, zero payoff.  First, let's compare against someone throwing nothing but rocks.  If we throw rock, it's a tie (no payoff).  If we throw scissors, we lose 3.  If we throw paper, we win 1.

We get a stable proportion, rather than a fixed answer.  P = 3*S; R = 2*S.  Normalizing to a total probability of 1, we get\nS = 1/6, R = 1/3, P = 1/2.\nQ.E.D.\nI realize that it's a bit counterintuitive that the choice with the best potential gain (rock) is not the largest proportion of the optimal mix.

So, q_R = p_R, q_P = p_P, q_S = p_S.\nLet's find the opponent's strategy (q_R, q_P, q_S) that makes us indifferent between our choices. So we set E_R = E_P = E_S.\n1) -q_P + 3q_S = q_R - 2q_S\n   q_R + q_P = 5q_S  (Equation A)\n2) q_R - 2q_S = -3q_R + 2q_P\n   4q_R - 2q_P = 2q_S\n   2q_R - q_P = q_S   (Equation B)\nWe also have the constraint:\n3) q_R + q_P + q_S = 1 (Equation C)\n\nSubstitute q_S from Equation B into Equation A:\nq_R + q_P = 5(2q_R - q_P)\nq_R + q_P = 10q_R - 5q_P\n6q_P = 9q_R\n2q_P = 3q_R  => q_P = (3/2)q_R\n\nNow substitute q_P = (3/2)q_R into Equation B:\n2q_R - (3/2)q_R = q_S\n(1/2)q_R = q_S  => q_R = 2q_S\n\nSince q_P = (3/2)q_R and q_R = 2q_S:\nq_P = (3/2)(2q_S) = 3q_S.\nSo we have q_R = 2q_S and q_P = 3q_S.\nSubstitute these into Equation C:\n2q_S + 3q_S + q_S = 1\n6q_S = 1\nq_S = 1/6\n\nNow find q_R and q_P:\nq_R = 2q_S = 2 * (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3.\nq_P = 3q_S = 3 * (1/6) = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nSo the opponent's optimal strategy is (q_R, q_P, q_S) = (1/3, 1/2, 1/6).\nSince the game is symmetric, our optimal strategy (p_R, p_P, p_S) is the same:\np_R = 1/3\np_P = 1/2\np_S = 1/6\n\nLet's check the sum of probabilities: 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 3/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1.\nThe strategy is to play Rock 1/3 of the time, Paper 1/2 of the time, and Scissors 1/6 of the time.\nThe ratio of Rock : Paper : Scissors is (1/3) : (1/2) : (1/6). To express this with integers, we multiply by the least common multiple of the denominators (6):\n(6 * 1/3) : (6 * 1/2) : (6 * 1/6) = 2 : 3 : 1.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the game V.\nV = E_R = -q_P + 3q_S = -(1/2) + 3*(1/6) = -1/2 + 1/2 = 0.\nV = E_P = q_R - 2q_S = (1/3) - 2*(1/6) = 1/3 - 1/3 = 0.\nV = E_S = -3q_R + 2q_P = -3*(1/3) + 2*(1/2) = -1 + 1 = 0.\nSo the value of the game is 0. This means that if we play this strategy, our expected payoff is 0, regardless of what the opponent plays (as long as they are rational). This strategy maintains the balance of chips.\n\nTo verify the hint that playing 1:1:1 (i.e., p_R=p_P=p_S=1/3) loses to an opponent who plays only Rock (q_R=1, q_P=0, q_S=0):\nE = (1/3) * E(R,R) + (1/3) * E(P,R) + (1/3) * E(S,R)\nE = (1/3) * 0 + (1/3) * 1 + (1/3) * (-3) = 0 + 1/3 - 3/3 = -2/3.\nThis confirms the hint.\n\nNow let's check our strategy (1/3, 1/2, 1/6) against an opponent who plays only Rock (q_R=1, q_P=0, q_S=0):\nE = (1/3) * E(R,R) + (1/2) * E(P,R) + (1/6) * E(S,R)\nE = (1/3) * 0 + (1/2) * 1 + (1/6) * (-3) = 0 + 1/2 - 3/6 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.\nOur strategy yields an expected payoff of 0 against an opponent playing only Rock. It will yield 0 against any pure strategy, and thus against any mixed strategy.\n\nThe question asks for the best strategy (mixture of rock, paper, and scissors) for maintaining the balance of chips. The strategy (p_R, p_P, p_S) = (1/3, 1/2, 1/6) ensures an expected payoff of 0, thus maintaining the balance of chips in the long run. The mixture is in the ratio 2:3:1 for Rock:Paper:Scissors.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Play Rock 1/3, Paper 1/2, Scissors 1/6 of the time (a ratio of 2:3:1)}}$\nFinal Answer: The best strategy is to play Rock with probability 1/3, Paper with probability 1/2, and Scissors with probability 1/6.

This means that at least one of $a$ or $b$ must be odd.\n4.  The system can't measure 119 pounds, but any object above 119 pounds can be expressed as a sum of combinations of these two weights. This means that 119 is the largest integer that cannot be expressed in the form $ax + by$ for non-negative integers $x$ and $y$. This number is known as the Frobenius number, denoted $g(a,b)$.\n5.  The Frobenius number $g(a,b)$ is defined only when $\\gcd(a,b)=1$. If $\\gcd(a,b)=d>1$, then any linear combination $ax+by$ is a multiple of $d$.

So, $X = a-1 > 9$ and $Y = b-1 > 9$.\nWe need to find pairs of factors $(X,Y)$ of 120 such that $X > 9$ and $Y > 9$.\nThe factors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\nWe list possible values for $X$ such that $X > 9$:\nPossible values for $X$ are 10, 12, 15, 20, ...\nFor each $X$, we find $Y = 120/X$ and check if $Y > 9$.\n*   If $X=10$: $Y = 120/10 = 12$. Since $12 > 9$, this is a valid pair for $(X,Y)$.\n    This gives $a = X+1 = 10+1 = 11$ and $b = Y+1 = 12+1 = 13$.\n    Let's check the conditions for $(a,b) = (11,13)$:\n    *   $a > 10, b > 10$: $11 > 10, 13 > 10$. (Satisfied)\n    *   Not both even: 11 is odd, 13 is odd. So they are not both even. (Satisfied)\n    *   $\\gcd(a,b)=1$: $\\gcd(11,13)=1$. (Satisfied, so the Frobenius number formula is applicable)\n    *   $g(11,13) = 11 \\times 13 - 11 - 13 = 143 - 24 = 119$. (Satisfied)\n    *   Check representability of 90: $11x + 13y = 90$.\n        If $y=0, 11x=90$ (no integer $x$).\n        If $y=1, 11x=90-13=77 \\implies x=7$. So $(x,y)=(7,1)$ is a solution. $11(7)+13(1)=77+13=90$. (Satisfied: 90 can be measured)\n    *   Check non-representability of 69: $11x + 13y = 69$.\n        If $y=0, 11x=69$ (no integer $x$).\n        If $y=1, 11x=69-13=56$ (no integer $x$).\n        If $y=2, 11x=69-26=43$ (no integer $x$).\n        If $y=3, 11x=69-39=30$ (no integer $x$).\n        If $y=4, 11x=69-52=17$ (no integer $x$).\n        If $y=5, 11x=69-65=4$ (no integer $x$).\n        Since $13y \\le 69 \\implies y \\le 69/13 \\approx 5.3$, these are all possible values for $y$. None yield an integer $x$. (Satisfied: 69 cannot be measured)\n    This pair $(11,13)$ meets all conditions.\n\nLet's check for other pairs $(X,Y)$:\n*   If $X=12$: $Y = 120/12 = 10$. Since $10 > 9$, this is a valid pair for $(X,Y)$.\n    This gives $a = X+1 = 12+1 = 13$ and $b = Y+1 = 10+1 = 11$. This is the same pair of weights $\\{11,13\\}$.\n*   If $X=15$: $Y = 120/15 = 8$. Since $8 \\not> 9$, this is not a valid pair.\n    For any factor $X$ of 120 such that $X > 12$, $Y=120/X$ will be less than 10. For example if $X=15$, $Y=8$. If $X=20$, $Y=6$.\n    More formally, we need $X>9$ and $Y=120/X > 9$. The second inequality implies $120 > 9X$, so $X < 120/9 = 40/3 = 13.33...$.\n    So we need $X$ to be a factor of 120 such that $9 < X < 13.33...$.\n    The factors of 120 in this range are $X=10$ and $X=12$.\n    These led to the pair $\\{11,13\\}$.\n\nThus, the only pair of integers satisfying the conditions $a,b > 10$ and $(a-1)(b-1)=120$ is $(11,13)$ (or $(13,11)$). We have verified that this pair meets all the other conditions stated in the problem.\nThe two types of weights are 11 pounds and 13 pounds.\n\nThe hint mentions $g(3,4)=5$. This is correct: $3 \\times 4 - 3 - 4 = 12 - 7 = 5$.\nThe example with 5 and 7: $g(5,7)=5 \\times 7 - 5 - 7 = 35-12=23$.\nThe statement \"17 (5+5+7) can be expressed as a sum of only 5s and 7s. 18, on the other hand, can't.\"\n$17 = 2 \\times 5 + 1 \\times 7$. This is correct.\n$18 = x \\times 5 + y \\times 7$.\nIf $y=0, 5x=18$ (no).\nIf $y=1, 5x=11$ (no).\nIf $y=2, 5x=4$ (no).\nSo 18 indeed cannot be expressed using 5s and 7s. This is consistent as $18 < 23$. The example serves as an illustration of how the system works.\n\nFinal check:\nWeights are 11 and 13.\nBoth > 10. (11>10, 13>10)\nNot both even. (11 is odd, 13 is odd)\nLargest unrepresentable is $11 \\times 13 - 11 - 13 = 143 - 24 = 119$. (Correct)\n300 can be measured: $300 > 119$, so yes. $11(19) + 13(7) = 209 + 91 = 300$.\n90 can be measured: $11(7) + 13(1) = 77+13=90$. (Correct)\n69 cannot be measured: We showed it's not possible. (Correct)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{11 and 13}}$.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 74, "Question": "Question: Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a primitive culture whose founding chief had eleven fingers. This chief had a strong affinity for the number eleven because of his special circumstances and thus founded a numbering system based on the number eleven. The number 121 had very special meaning, as it was eleven times eleven.\nThe system of weight measures that he devised were also based on the number eleven. The base unit was called a stone, for a convenient rock that was handy. The next unit was the lump, being eleven stone in weight. Eleven lumps were called a mass.\nSo: 11 stone = a lump and 11 lumps = a mass.\nThe problem was, using 10 lump and 11 stone weights to measure out any weight from 1 stone to 1 mass required carrying around quite a lot of weight! The chief, being aware that this was beyond his math skills, asked his advisors for help. The request was to come up with a minimum number of weights that would allow for the weighing of any measure between one stone and one mass using a set of scales.

We are given that 1 mass = 121 stones. The hint states that \"The number eleven has nothing to do with the set of weights\", so we should ignore the base-11 context for the weights themselves and focus on the range of weights to be measured: from 1 to 121 stones.\n\nThis is a classic weighing puzzle that can be solved using a balanced ternary system. When using a balance scale, a weight can be placed on one of three positions:\n1.  On the pan with the object to be weighed (effectively subtracting its value from the weights on the other pan).\n2.  On the pan opposite to the object (effectively adding its value).\n3.  Not used at all.\n\nLet the weights be $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$. To measure a weight $W$, we place $W$ on one pan. Then we can write $W = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i w_i$, where $c_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThe optimal set of weights for this problem are powers of 3: $3^0, 3^1, 3^2, \\ldots, 3^{n-1}$.\nWith such a set of $n$ weights, the maximum weight that can be measured is the sum of all these weights, which is $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 3^i = \\frac{3^n - 1}{3-1} = \\frac{3^n - 1}{2}$.\nWe need to measure any weight up to 121 stones.

This gives $3^n$ possible arrangements of weights.\nThese arrangements correspond to different measurable effective weights. The measurable values are of the form $\\sum c_i w_i$. The set of values is symmetric around 0. The number of distinct non-zero values is at most $3^n-1$. The number of distinct positive values is at most $(3^n-1)/2$.\nWe need to measure 121 distinct positive weights (from 1 to 121).\nSo, we must have $\\frac{3^n-1}{2} \\ge 121$.\nThis leads to $3^n \\ge 243$.\nIf $n=4$, $3^4 = 81$. $\\frac{81-1}{2} = 40$. So 4 weights can measure up to 40 stones, which is not enough.\nIf $n=5$, $3^5 = 243$. $\\frac{243-1}{2} = 121$. So 5 weights can measure up to 121 stones, which is exactly what is needed.\nThus, the minimum number of weights is 5.\n\nThe solution the advisors came up with is the set of these 5 weights.\n\nThe solution is the set of weights: {1 stone, 3 stones, 9 stones, 27 stones, 81 stones}.\n\nFinal Answer: The solution is a set of 5 weights: 1 stone, 3 stones, 9 stones, 27 stones, and 81 stones.", "Status": true}

So, the rule is: if digit is $d$, the new digit is $(d-1) \\pmod{10}$.\nLet's apply this transformation to each digit of S:\n-   $4 - 1 = 3$\n-   $2 - 1 = 1$\n-   $5 - 1 = 4$\n-   $2 - 1 = 1$\n-   $6 - 1 = 5$\n-   $0 - 1 = 9 \\pmod{10}$\n-   $3 - 1 = 2$\n-   $7 - 1 = 6$\n-   $6 - 1 = 5$\n-   $4 - 1 = 3$\n-   $6 - 1 = 5$\n-   $9 - 1 = 8$\n-   $0 - 1 = 9 \\pmod{10}$\n-   $8 - 1 = 7$\n-   $0 - 1 = 9 \\pmod{10}$\n-   $4 - 1 = 3$\n-   $3 - 1 = 2$\n-   $4 - 1 = 3$\n-   $9 - 1 = 8$\n-   $5 - 1 = 4$\n-   $7 - 1 = 6$\n\nPutting these new digits together, we get the sequence P = 314159265358979323846.\n\nLet's check if this sequence P is related to any famous mathematical constant.\nThe number pi ($\\pi$) is approximately 3.1415926535...\nLet's list the digits of pi:\n$\\pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433...$\nThe digits of $\\pi$, starting with the integer part '3', are:\n3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2, ...\n\nThe sequence P we derived is 314159265358979323846.\nLet's compare P with the digits of $\\pi$:\nDigits of $\\pi$: 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6\nThese are the first 21 digits of $\\pi$ (the integer part '3' followed by the first 20 decimal places).\nThe sequence P = 314159265358979323846 matches exactly these first 21 digits of $\\pi$.\n\nSo, the original sequence S is obtained by taking the first 21 digits of $\\pi$ (which are 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6) and adding 1 to each digit (modulo 10).\nFor example, the first digit of $\\pi$ is 3. Adding 1 gives $3+1=4$, which is the first digit of S.\nThe sixth digit of $\\pi$ is 9. Adding 1 gives $9+1=10$, which is $0 \\pmod{10}$. This is the sixth digit of S.\n\nTherefore, what is special about the sequence S is its relationship with the digits of $\\pi$. Specifically, if you subtract 1 from each digit of S (modulo 10, where 0 becomes 9), you obtain the first 21 digits of $\\pi$ (starting with 3).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{If you subtract 1 from each digit (modulo 10, so 0 becomes 9), you get the first 21 digits of pi (314159265358979323846)}}$.", "Status": true}

This implies x(x - 8) / 4 > 0. Since x = G + B > 0, we must have x - 8 > 0, so x > 8.\nAlso, for y to be an integer, x(x - 8) must be divisible by 4.\nIf x is odd, then x - 8 is odd. So x(x - 8) is odd, which is not divisible by 4.

Let 8x = k^2 for some non-negative integer k.\nThe roots are G, B = (x +/- sqrt(D)) / 2 = (x +/- k) / 2.\nFor G and B to be integers, (x +/- k) must be even.\nSince 8x = k^2, k^2 is a multiple of 8. This means k must be a multiple of 4 (since k^2 must be divisible by 4, so k must be even, say k=2m. Then k^2 = 4m^2. So 8x = 4m^2, which means 2x = m^2.

Since G,B are integers, k must be an integer.\nSo 8x must be a perfect square. This means 2 * 4 * x = k^2, so 2x must be a perfect square.\nLet 2x = m^2 for some integer m.\nSince x > 0, m != 0.\nSince 2x = m^2, m^2 must be an even number, so m must be an even integer.\nLet m = 2n for some non-zero integer n.

Your hope, though, is that it will help by drawing more regular customers in the long run.  Your goal is to profit $20 even after the coupon losses.

Now we have a whole number for l...however, x is greater than l, so (2) is now false. We can also see that if we increase x further, l will be decreasing, so (2) will only continue farther and farther from truth.\nThis proves that s cannot be 3, and is now narrowed down to s=4.\nSubstituting s=4 into (5) gives: 7l + 8x = 110, solved for l gives (7): l = (110 - 8x) / 7.\nNow we again test x-values (minimum of x=5) for valid results: If x=5, l=10. Because l is a whole number greater than x, this is a valid solution! Increasing x by 7 to find the next possibility gives x=12, l=2. x > l, so any greater x-value is impossible.\nThe solution is s=4, m=16, x=5, l=10. This is a total of 35 slushes, and therefore 35 coupons given out. 35 * $0.75 = $26.25 in losses from the coupons. $46.50 - $26.25 = $20.25 net profit when accounting for the coupons.

Without even considering the rules for when in the month the\nclock is changed, these possible solutions are ruled out because we know that both visits were in the evening (\"Mad Ade spent a second evening with Mike Rohsopht\") and they involve times in a different part of the day.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Let $t$ be the number of hours that have passed since Mad Ade's first visit.\nAt the time of the first visit, the clock was 3 minutes slow.\nThe clock loses 7 minutes every hour.\nSo, after $t$ hours of real time, the clock has lost an additional $7t$ minutes.\nThe total time the clock is slow after $t$ hours is $3 + 7t$ minutes.\n\nThe problem states that on the second visit, the clock was \"dead right by radio time at the hour\".\nThe hint says \"It must lose some multiple of 12 hours in total\". This implies we are dealing with a 12-hour clock cycle for being \"dead right\".\nA 12-hour period is $12 \\times 60 = 720$ minutes.\nSo, for the clock to be \"dead right\", the total amount it is slow must be a multiple of 720 minutes.\nLet this multiple be $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\nSo, $3 + 7t = 720n$.\n\nWe need to find $t$, the number of hours. So $t$ must be an integer.\n$7t = 720n - 3$.\n$t = \\frac{720n - 3}{7}$.\nFor $t$ to be an integer, $720n - 3$ must be divisible by 7.\nLet's find the remainder of 720 when divided by 7:\n$720 = 7 \\times 102 + 6$.\nSo, $720 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$, or $720 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$.\nSubstituting this into the condition:\n$(-1)n - 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\n$-n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n$n \\equiv -3 \\pmod{7}$.\n$n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $n$ is 4.\n(Other possible values for $n$ would be $4+7=11$, $4+2 \\times 7=18$, etc.)\nLet's use the smallest positive integer $n=4$.\n$t = \\frac{720 \\times 4 - 3}{7} = \\frac{2880 - 3}{7} = \\frac{2877}{7}$.\nPerforming the division: $2877 \\div 7$.\n$28 \\div 7 = 4$.\n$7 \\div 7 = 1$.\n$7 \\div 7 = 1$.\nSo, $2877 \\div 7 = 411$.\nThus, $t = 411$ hours.\n\nThis means the second visit was 411 hours after the first visit.\nThe first visit was on a Sunday.\nWe need to determine the day of the week 411 hours later.\nFirst, let's convert 411 hours into days and hours:\n$411 \\div 24$:\n$411 = 24 \\times 17 + 3$.\nSo, 411 hours is equal to 17 days and 3 hours.\n\nThe second visit was 17 days and 3 hours after the first visit.\nThe first visit was on Sunday. We need to find the day of the week 17 days after Sunday.\nThe day of the week repeats every 7 days.\n$17 \\pmod{7}$:\n$17 = 2 \\times 7 + 3$.\nSo, 17 days after Sunday is the same day of the week as 3 days after Sunday.\nSunday + 1 day = Monday.\nSunday + 2 days = Tuesday.\nSunday + 3 days = Wednesday.\nSo, the second visit was on a Wednesday.\n\nWe should also check the condition \"later that same month\".\nIf $t = 411$ hours, this is 17 days and 3 hours.\nIf the first visit (Sunday) was, for example, on the 1st of a month, the second visit would be on the 18th of that month (1 day + 17 days = 18th day). This is in the same month.\nIf the first Sunday was on the 10th of a month with 30 days, the second visit would be on the 27th of that month. This is in the same month.\nIf the first Sunday was on the 13th of a month with 30 days, the second visit would be on the 30th of that month. This is in the same month.\nIf the first Sunday was on the 14th of a month with 30 days, the second visit would be on the 31st, which is in the next month if the month has 30 days. But if the month has 31 days, then it is in the same month.\nSo, it's possible for the second visit to be in the same month.\n\nWhat if we had chosen the next possible value for $n$?\nThe next value would be $n = 4+7 = 11$.\n$t = \\frac{720 \\times 11 - 3}{7} = \\frac{7920 - 3}{7} = \\frac{7917}{7} = 1131$ hours.\n$1131 \\text{ hours} = 1131 \\div 24 \\text{ days} = 47 \\text{ days and } 3 \\text{ hours}$.\n47 days is longer than any month (which has at most 31 days). So, a second visit 47 days later would not be in the same month.\nTherefore, $t=411$ hours is the correct time elapsed.\n\nThe day of the week for Mad Ade's second visit is Wednesday.\n\nFinal check:\nClock is 3 minutes slow initially.\nIt loses 7 minutes per hour.\nAfter 411 hours, it has lost an additional $7 \\times 411 = 2877$ minutes.\nTotal amount slow = $3 + 2877 = 2880$ minutes.\n$2880 \\text{ minutes} = 2880 / 60 \\text{ hours} = 48 \\text{ hours}$.\n48 hours is exactly $4 \\times 12$ hours (and $2 \\times 24$ hours).\nSo, the clock is 48 hours slow. This means it shows the correct time (e.g., if it's 9 PM, the clock shows 9 PM, but 2 days earlier). For a 12-hour or 24-hour display, it will appear \"dead right\".\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Wednesday}}$.", "Status": true}

The sum of all integers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. So the sum of additional pieces cut will be n*(n+1)/2.\nFinally add 1 because we start with 1 piece: n*(n+1)/2 + 1.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Let L(n) be the maximum number of pieces we can form with n straight cuts of a pizza.\n\nBase case:\nFor n = 0, there are no cuts, so there is 1 piece (the whole pizza). Thus, L(0) = 1.\n\nInductive step:\nSuppose we have already made j cuts, and we have obtained L(j) pieces. We want to make the (j+1)-th cut.\nTo maximize the number of new pieces created by the (j+1)-th cut, this cut must intersect as many of the previous j cuts as possible, and all these intersection points must be distinct.\nIf the (j+1)-th cut intersects k of the previous j cuts at k distinct points, then these k intersection points divide the (j+1)-th cut (which is a line) into k+1 segments. Each of these k+1 segments passes through an existing region and divides that region into two pieces. Therefore, the (j+1)-th cut adds k+1 new pieces.\nTo maximize the number of new pieces, we need to maximize k. We can make the (j+1)-th cut intersect all j previous cuts at distinct points. This is possible if we choose the (j+1)-th cut such that:\n1. It is not parallel to any of the previous j cuts.\n2. It does not pass through any of the intersection points of the previous j cuts.\nUnder these conditions, the (j+1)-th cut will intersect each of the j previous cuts at a distinct point. So, k = j.\nTherefore, the (j+1)-th cut adds j+1 new pieces.\nSo, we have the recurrence relation:\nL(j+1) = L(j) + (j+1)\nOr, equivalently, for n >= 1:\nL(n) = L(n-1) + n\n\nWe can write out the terms:\nL(0) = 1\nL(1) = L(0) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\nL(2) = L(1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\nL(3) = L(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\nL(4) = L(3) + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11\nAnd so on.\n\nTo find a closed-form formula for L(n), we can expand the recurrence relation:\nL(n) = L(n-1) + n\n     = (L(n-2) + (n-1)) + n\n     = L(n-2) + (n-1) + n\n     = ...\n     = L(0) + 1 + 2 + ... + (n-1) + n\nSince L(0) = 1, we have:\nL(n) = 1 + (1 + 2 + ... + n)\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:\nSum = n(n+1)/2\nSo,\nL(n) = 1 + n(n+1)/2\n\nWe can also write this as:\nL(n) = 2/2 + (n^2 + n)/2\nL(n) = (n^2 + n + 2)/2\n\nLet's check the formula for small values of n:\nFor n = 0: L(0) = 1 + 0(0+1)/2 = 1 + 0 = 1.

As mentioned in the hint, there are many methods in which to solve this. One less complex method is to imagine the axis of the cone form a right triangle.

Imagine a radius that intersects the hypotenuse of the triangle discussed above. Let's call it x. Therefore, we get a right triangle with a smaller right triangle inside. Since two of the angles are the same (the top and the right angles), we can say that the two triangles are similar. Since the height of the cylinder is 2x (twice the length of the radius x), the height of the smaller right triangle is 12-2x.

Note that jacks are 11, queens are 12, kings are 13.  Two jokers are added to the deck and are each worth 15.  The cards are dealt among the four players.  A hand starts when the dealer shouts \"Let's Snapoker!\"  Following a frenetic minute of randomly throwing all cards onto the table, and at the dealer's call of \"Heeeeeeere, piggy, piggy, piggy!\" players are required to grab as many cards as they can.  Once all cards have been grabbed, the total value of the cards in each player's hand is added up.  Points (4, 3, 2 and 1) are awarded to players on each hand, with the highest card total receiving maximum points.  In the event of a tie, the player who can drink a glass of milk through their nose the quickest will receive the greater points.  A running score is kept throughout the game.  The game is over when someone reaches a total of 518 points or when a fight breaks out, which is a common occurrence.\nIn a game of Snapoker I was playing the other day, my good friend Kasy managed to grab 13 cards that formed an alternating-colours straight (ie. the odd cards were all red, the evens were all black).

The hint suggests using an analog clock. The painting titles are \"Number X\", where X is a number. We need to find this number X.\n\nLet's denote the position of the hour hand as $H_{pos}$ and the position of the minute hand as $M_{pos}$. Both angles are measured in degrees clockwise from the 12 o'clock position.\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves $360/60 = 6$ degrees per minute.\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours (720 minutes), so it moves $360/720 = 0.5$ degrees per minute, or $360/12 = 30$ degrees per hour.\n\nLet H be the hour and M be the minutes.\nThe position of the minute hand is $M_{pos} = M \\times 6^\\circ$.\nThe position of the hour hand is $H_{pos} = (H_{12} + M/60) \\times 30^\\circ$, where $H_{12}$ is the hour in 12-hour format (e.g., for 11:00, $H_{12}=11$; for 4:00, $H_{12}=4$). If H is 12, we can use 0 for calculation, or (12 + M/60)*30 mod 360. Alternatively, $H_{pos} = (H \\pmod{12} + M/60) \\times 30^\\circ$. If H=12, then H mod 12 = 0. So for 12:xx, it's (0 + M/60)*30.\nLet's use hours from 0 to 11. So, 12 o'clock is 0, 1 o'clock is 1, ..., 11 o'clock is 11.\nSo, $H_{pos} = (H + M/60) \\times 30^\\circ$.\n\nLet's analyze the given data:\n1.  At 11:00, \"Number 30\" was hung.\n    $H = 11, M = 0$.\n    $M_{pos} = 0 \\times 6^\\circ = 0^\\circ$.\n    $H_{pos} = (11 + 0/60) \\times 30^\\circ = 11 \\times 30^\\circ = 330^\\circ$.\n    Let's test the hypothesis that the number is the angle measured clockwise from the hour hand to the minute hand.\n    Angle $= (M_{pos} - H_{pos}) \\pmod{360}$. If the result is negative, we add 360.\n    Angle $= (0 - 330) \\pmod{360} = -330 \\pmod{360} = 30^\\circ$.\n    This matches \"Number 30\".\n\n2.

At 7:30, \"Number 315\" was hung.\n    $H = 7, M = 30$.\n    $M_{pos} = 30 \\times 6^\\circ = 180^\\circ$.\n    $H_{pos} = (7 + 30/60) \\times 30^\\circ = (7 + 0.5) \\times 30^\\circ = 7.5 \\times 30^\\circ = 225^\\circ$.\n    Angle $= (M_{pos} - H_{pos}) \\pmod{360} = (180 - 225) \\pmod{360} = -45 \\pmod{360} = 315^\\circ$.\n    This matches \"Number 315\".\n\nThe hypothesis seems to be correct: the painting number is the angle in degrees measured clockwise from the hour hand to the minute hand.\n\nNow we need to find the painting that will be hung at 9:20.\n$H = 9, M = 20$.\n$M_{pos} = 20 \\times 6^\\circ = 120^\\circ$.\n$H_{pos} = (9 + 20/60) \\times 30^\\circ = (9 + 1/3) \\times 30^\\circ = (28/3) \\times 30^\\circ = 28 \\times 10^\\circ = 280^\\circ$.\nAngle $= (M_{pos} - H_{pos}) \\pmod{360} = (120 - 280) \\pmod{360} = -160 \\pmod{360}$.\n$-160 + 360 = 200^\\circ$.\n\nSo, at 9:20, the painting titled \"Number 200\" will be hung.\n\nFinal check using alternative calculation for hour hand position:\nHour hand moves $0.5^\\circ$ per minute. Total minutes from 12:00 for H:M is $H \\times 60 + M$. For H in 12-hour format (1 to 12).

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you will have a triangle with a base of one mile (or 63,360 inches), and a hypotenuse of one mile plus one inch (or 63,361 inches). To find the height, take the square root of (the square of the base minus the square of the hypotenuse). SQRT((63,361)^2 - (63,360)^2) = 355.98 inches, or over 29 feet!", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine why Henry's boss was so critical:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem Setup:**\n    Henry's plan involves laying tracks of length L = 1 mile each, end-to-end with no gaps. The tracks are \"pinned to the ground at every other juncture\". This means that a segment of two tracks, with total length 2L, is pinned at its ends, while the juncture between these two tracks is not pinned. When the tracks expand, this unpinned juncture is free to move upwards (buckle).\n\n2.  **Determine the Expansion:**\n    Each track of length L = 1 mile expands by $\\Delta L$ = 1 inch in temperature extremes.\n\n3.  **Model the Buckling:**\n    Consider a segment consisting of two tracks. The initial total length of this segment is 2L. The ends of this segment are pinned, so the distance between the pins is 2L.\n    When the tracks expand, each track of length L expands to $L + \\Delta L$. So, the total length of the two tracks becomes $2(L + \\Delta L) = 2L + 2\\Delta L$.\n    Since the ends are pinned at a distance 2L apart, the expanded tracks must buckle. We assume they buckle upwards symmetrically, forming an isosceles triangle. The base of this triangle is 2L (the distance between the pins). The two equal sides of the triangle are the expanded tracks, each of length $L + \\Delta L$. Let h be the height of the buckle at the middle juncture.\n\n4.  **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n    We can consider one half of the isosceles triangle. This forms a right-angled triangle with:\n    *   Base = L (half the distance between the pins).\n    *   Height = h (the height of the buckle).\n    *   Hypotenuse = $L + \\Delta L$ (the length of one expanded track).\n    According to the Pythagorean theorem, $L^2 + h^2 = (L + \\Delta L)^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Buckle Height (h):**\n    From the Pythagorean theorem, we can solve for $h^2$:\n    $h^2 = (L + \\Delta L)^2 - L^2$\n    $h^2 = (L^2 + 2L\\Delta L + (\\Delta L)^2) - L^2$\n    $h^2 = 2L\\Delta L + (\\Delta L)^2$\n    So, $h = \\sqrt{2L\\Delta L + (\\Delta L)^2}$.\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    We are given:\n    L = 1 mile\n    $\\Delta L$ = 1 inch\n    We need to use consistent units. Let's convert L to inches:\n    1 mile = 5280 feet\n    1 foot = 12 inches\n    So, L = $5280 \\times 12$ inches = 63360 inches.\n    Now, substitute L = 63360 inches and $\\Delta L$ = 1 inch into the formula for h:\n    $h = \\sqrt{2 \\times 63360 \\times 1 + (1)^2}$\n    $h = \\sqrt{126720 + 1}$\n    $h = \\sqrt{126721}$ inches.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of h:**\n    We need to calculate $\\sqrt{126721}$.\n    We can estimate this value:\n    $350^2 = 122500$\n    $360^2 = 129600$\n    So, h is between 350 and 360 inches.\n    Let's try values ending in 1 or 9.\n    $350 \\times 350 = 122500$\n    $355^2 = 126025$\n    $356^2 = 126736$\n    So, h is very close to 356 inches.\n    More precisely, $h \\approx 355.9789$ inches.\n    Let's convert this height to feet:\n    $h \\approx 355.9789 \\text{ inches} / (12 \\text{ inches/foot}) \\approx 29.6649$ feet.\n    So, the buckle height is approximately 29.67 feet.\n\n8.  **Compare the Calculated Height with Henry's Claim:**\n    Henry claimed that \"If the tracks buckle, it will only be by an inch or two at most.\"\n    Our calculation shows that the buckle height is approximately 356 inches, or nearly 30 feet.\n    This is vastly different from Henry's estimate of 1 or 2 inches.\n\n9.  **Explain Why the Boss Was So Critical:**\n    The boss was so critical because Henry's assessment of the buckle height was catastrophically wrong. A buckle of nearly 30 feet high would make the railway tracks completely impassable and extremely dangerous. Trains would certainly not \"have no trouble bumping over these buckles\"; they would derail with devastating consequences.\n    Henry's miscalculation demonstrated a severe lack of understanding of basic engineering principles (specifically, the geometry of buckling due to thermal expansion, as revealed by the Pythagorean theorem). Such a fundamental error in a critical safety aspect of civil engineering design is unacceptable and justifies the boss's harsh reaction, including firing Henry. The hint about Pythagoras points to the correct method Henry should have used.\n\nTherefore, the boss was critical because Henry's analysis was dangerously flawed, underestimating the buckle height by a factor of hundreds, which would lead to a catastrophic failure of the railway.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{The buckle height would be about 29.67 feet, not an inch or two as Henry claimed. This large buckle would be catastrophic for trains.}$", "Status": true}

The combined rate is vA + vB + vC.\n    *   This rope will be consumed in 1 / (1/60 + 1/90 + 1/180) = 1 / ( (3+2+1)/180 ) = 1 / (6/180) = 180/6 = 30 minutes.\n\n2.

The standard interpretation for these types of problems is that their speeds sum up if working on the same object from different access points or in parallel).\n    Rope 1 will be completely consumed in 30 minutes.\n\n2.  **At the moment Rope 1 is finished (t=30 minutes):**\n    Immediately take the second rope (Rope 2).\n    Simultaneously, have Mouse A start biting one end of Rope 2 and Mouse C start biting the other end of Rope 2. (Mouse B is idle during this phase).\n    Rope 2 will be completely consumed in an additional 45 minutes.\n\n3.  **End of timing:**\n    When Rope 2 is completely consumed, the total time elapsed from the very beginning (start of step 1) will be 30 minutes (from Rope 1) + 45 minutes (from Rope 2) = 75 minutes.\n\nFinal answer: The procedure is as follows:\n1.  Take the first rope. Have Mouse A, Mouse B, and Mouse C all start biting this rope simultaneously. Mouse A can bite from one end, Mouse B from the other, and Mouse C can also join in (e.g., with Mouse A or B). Their combined speeds will consume the rope. This rope will be fully consumed in 30 minutes (calculated as 1 / (1/60 + 1/90 + 1/180) = 30).\n2.  As soon as the first rope is completely consumed (at the 30-minute mark), immediately take the second rope. Have Mouse A start biting from one end and Mouse C start biting from the other end. This rope will be fully consumed in an additional 45 minutes (calculated as 1 / (1/60 + 1/180) = 45).\n3.  The total time elapsed from the beginning of step 1 until the end of step 2 (when the second rope is consumed) is 30 minutes + 45 minutes = 75 minutes.", "Status": true}

So $Y$ also consists only of digits 1 and 0.\nThe number of 1's in $X$ is the same as the number of 1's in $Y$. So, $N_1(Y)$ must be a multiple of 9.\n\nWe have $X = Y \\cdot 100$. We also know $X$ is a multiple of 225.\nSo, $Y \\cdot 100 = k \\cdot 225$ for some integer $k$.\n$Y \\cdot 100 = k \\cdot 9 \\cdot 25$.\n$Y \\cdot 4 \\cdot 25 = k \\cdot 9 \\cdot 25$.\nDividing by 25, we get $4Y = 9k$.\nSince 4 and 9 are coprime, $Y$ must be a multiple of 9.\n\nSo we are looking for the smallest number $Y$ such that:\n1. $Y$ consists only of digits 1 and 0.\n2. $Y$ is a multiple of 9.\nOnce we find the smallest such $Y$, the minimum number of gums will be $X = Y \\cdot 100$.\n\nSince $Y$ is a multiple of 9 and consists only of digits 1 and 0, the number of 1's in $Y$, $N_1(Y)$, must be a multiple of 9.\nTo minimize $Y$, we should use the minimum possible number of 1's, which is 9.\nAlso, to minimize $Y$, we should make $Y$ as short as possible and place the 1's in the most significant positions (to the left).\nSo, the smallest number $Y$ consisting of nine 1's and no 0's (or 0s placed to the right of 1s, which would make the number larger or longer) is $Y = 111111111$.\nLet's check if $Y = 111111111$ is a multiple of 9.

(Equation 2)\nNote that the hint says \"legs could be lost (\"they now had\")\". So, L_c is not necessarily 2C. We must have L_c <= 2C.\n\nFrom the third cadet's statement: \"the number of cadet legs was 14 more than the total number of cadet and shark heads.\"\nThe total number of cadet and shark heads is C + S.\nSo, L_c = (C + S) + 14. (Equation 3)\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables (C, S, L_c).\nSubstitute Equation 1 into Equation 3:\nL_c = (4S + S) + 14\nL_c = 5S + 14. (Equation 4)\n\nNow we have two expressions for L_c (Equation 2 and Equation 4). Equate them:\nS^2 = 5S + 14.\n\nRearrange this into a quadratic equation:\nS^2 - 5S - 14 = 0.\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. These numbers are -7 and 2.\nSo, (S - 7)(S + 2) = 0.\nThis gives two possible solutions for S:\nS - 7 = 0  =>  S = 7\nS + 2 = 0  =>  S = -2\n\nSince the number of sharks cannot be negative, we have S = 7.\n\nNow we can find the other values:\nNumber of cadets, C = 4S = 4 * 7 = 28.\nNumber of legs the cadets now have, L_c = S^2 = 7^2 = 49.\nLet's check this with Equation 4: L_c = 5S + 14 = 5 * 7 + 14 = 35 + 14 = 49. This is consistent.\n\nWe should also check if it's possible for the cadets to have L_c legs.\nInitially, the cadets had 2C legs = 2 * 28 = 56 legs.\nSince L_c = 49, and L_c <= 2C (49 <= 56), this is possible. It means that 56 - 49 = 7 legs were lost during the fight.\nSince there are 28 cadets, it is possible for 7 legs to be lost among them.\n\nThe question asks for \"How many sharks were killed?\".\nThe problem states that \"all of the sharks were killed\". So the number of sharks killed is equal to the initial number of sharks, S.\nTherefore, the number of sharks killed is 7.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$", "Status": true}

However, when we get a last minute cancellation, we sometimes look for new and unusual ways to cut small amounts of cake.\nOn one such occasion, we tried to find a cake with an unusual set of attributes.\nFirst, it had to be a regular polygon, i.e. all sides equal in length and all angles equal in size.\nSecond, using only standard cuts (straight and perpendicular to the plate) from some corner to another, we would be able to exactly divide that polygon into equal portions.\nThird, except for the last cut, each cut would create one, and only one, such portion.  The last cut would create two such portions.\nFourth, there must be more than two portions. (Otherwise, a square or any regular polygon with an even number of sides would do. A cut from one corner to its opposing corner would carve out two pieces of 50% each.)\nFor discussion purposes, we decided to label the points of our polygons alphabetically.  A pentagon can only produce three pieces. Triangles ABC and CDE are equals, but triangle ACE is larger. A hexagon yields three or four pieces, but they will be of two different sizes.  Triangles ABC = CDE = EFA <> ACE, or triangles ABC = DEF <> CDF = FAC.

Let's check this:\nSum = x + y + z\nSince x + y = z, we can substitute z for x + y:\nSum = z + z = 2z.\n\nProduct = x * y * z\nSince x * y = 2, we can substitute 2 for x * y:\nProduct = 2 * z = 2z.\n\nSo, indeed, these two conditions (x + y = z and x * y = 2) imply that Sum = Product (both are equal to 2z).\n\nNow we use the given value of \u00a35.70.\nWe have Sum = 5.70 and Product = 5.70.\nSince Sum = 2z, we have 2z = 5.70.\nSolving for z:\nz = 5.70 / 2\nz = 2.85\n\nNow we have the value of z, and we can use the conditions derived from the hint to find x and y:\nx + y = z  =>  x + y = 2.85\nx * y = 2\n\nWe have a system of two equations for x and y:\nx + y = 2.85\nx * y = 2\n\nWe can form a quadratic equation whose roots are x and y. Let t be a variable representing these roots:\nt^2 - (sum of roots)t + (product of roots) = 0\nt^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0\nSubstitute the values of x+y and xy:\nt^2 - 2.85t + 2 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for t using the quadratic formula:\nt = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\nHere, a = 1, b = -2.85, c = 2.\nt = [2.85 \u00b1 sqrt((-2.85)^2 - 4 * 1 * 2)] / 2\nt = [2.85 \u00b1 sqrt(8.1225 - 8)] / 2\nt = [2.85 \u00b1 sqrt(0.1225)] / 2\nThe square root of 0.1225 is 0.35 (since 35^2 = 1225, so 0.35^2 = 0.1225).\nt = [2.85 \u00b1 0.35] / 2\n\nThis gives two possible values for t:\nt1 = (2.85 + 0.35) / 2 = 3.20 / 2 = 1.60\nt2 = (2.85 - 0.35) / 2 = 2.50 / 2 = 1.25\n\nSo, the prices x and y are 1.60 and 1.25 (in any order).\nThe three prices of the magazines are \u00a31.25, \u00a31.60, and \u00a32.85.\n\nLet's verify the solution:\nSum = 1.25 + 1.60 + 2.85 = 2.85 + 2.85 = 5.70.\nProduct = 1.25 * 1.60 * 2.85 = (5/4) * (8/5) * 2.85 = (5*8)/(4*5) * 2.85 = 40/20 * 2.85 = 2 * 2.85 = 5.70.\nThe sum and product are both \u00a35.70, as required.\n\nLet's verify the hint conditions:\nTwo prices add to the third: 1.25 + 1.60 = 2.85. This is true.\nThese two prices multiply to 2: 1.25 * 1.60 = 2. This is true.\n\nThe prices of the magazines are \u00a31.25, \u00a31.60, and \u00a32.85.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{\u00a31.25, \u00a31.60, \u00a32.85}}$\nFinal Answer: The prices of the magazines are \u00a31.25, \u00a31.60, and \u00a32.85.", "Status": true}

So Weedy divided his field into a two-digit square number of parts and kept just one part for himself. Now, Wig, Twig and Swig were identical triplets so each received the same whole number of parts.

Rastus, Wig, Twig and Swig together could plant a field of corn in five hours. The total work rate of this group is $y+x$. So, the amount of work to plant the field is $5(y+x)$.\n2. Wig, Twig and Swig and Willie himself together could manage the same task in six hours. The total work rate of this group is $x+z$. So, the amount of work to plant the field is $6(x+z)$.\n\nSince the task is the same, the amount of work is the same:\n$5(y+x) = 6(x+z)$\n$5y + 5x = 6x + 6z$\n$5y - 6z = x$ (This matches the hint)\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of parts Weedy divided his field into.\nWe are given that $N$ is a two-digit square number. So $N \\in \\{16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81\\}$.\nWeedy kept just one part for himself. The parts are divided in proportion to their work rates.\nThe five individuals are Willie, Rastus, Wig, Twig, Swig. Let $z, y, w_1, w_2, w_3$ be their respective work rates.\nThe triplets Wig, Twig, and Swig are identical, so $w_1=w_2=w_3$. Their combined work rate is $x = w_1+w_2+w_3 = 3w_1$.\nThe total work rate of all five individuals is $W_{total} = z + y + x$.\nWillie's share is $\\frac{z}{W_{total}} \\times N = 1$.\nSo, $N z = W_{total}$.\nSubstituting $W_{total} = z+y+x$, we get $N z = z+y+x$.\nNow substitute $x = 5y-6z$:\n$N z = z + y + (5y-6z)$\n$N z = z + 6y - 6z$\n$N z = 6y - 5z$\n$N z + 5z = 6y$\n$(N+5)z = 6y$\nSo, $y = \\frac{N+5}{6}z$.\n\nLet $n_R$ be the number of parts Rastus received.\n$n_R = \\frac{y}{W_{total}} \\times N$. Since $W_{total} = Nz$, we have $n_R = \\frac{y}{Nz} \\times N = \\frac{y}{z}$.\nSubstitute $y = \\frac{N+5}{6}z$:\n$n_R = \\frac{\\frac{N+5}{6}z}{z} = \\frac{N+5}{6}$.\nSince $n_R$ must be a whole number of parts, $N+5$ must be divisible by 6.\nLet's check the possible values for $N$:\n- If $N=16$, $N+5=21$. Not divisible by 6.\n- If $N=25$, $N+5=30$. $30/6=5$. So $n_R=5$. This is possible.\n- If $N=36$, $N+5=41$. Not divisible by 6.\n- If $N=49$, $N+5=54$. $54/6=9$. So $n_R=9$. This is possible.\n- If $N=64$, $N+5=69$. Not divisible by 6.\n- If $N=81$, $N+5=86$. Not divisible by 6.\nSo, the possible values for $N$ are $25$ and $49$.\n\nLet $n_{triplet}$ be the number of parts each triplet (Wig, Twig, Swig) received.\nThe combined share of the triplets is $3n_{triplet}$.\n$3n_{triplet} = \\frac{x}{W_{total}} \\times N = \\frac{x}{Nz} \\times N = \\frac{x}{z}$.\nSubstitute $x = 5y-6z$:\n$3n_{triplet} = \\frac{5y-6z}{z} = 5\\frac{y}{z} - 6$.\nWe know that $\\frac{y}{z} = n_R$. So, $3n_{triplet} = 5n_R - 6$.\nSince $n_{triplet}$ must be a whole number, $5n_R-6$ must be divisible by 3.\nSince $6$ is divisible by 3, $5n_R$ must be divisible by 3.\nAs 5 and 3 are coprime, $n_R$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's check this condition for the possible values of $N$:\n- If $N=25$, $n_R = 5$. Is 5 divisible by 3? No. So $N=25$ is not the solution.\n- If $N=49$, $n_R = 9$. Is 9 divisible by 3? Yes, $9/3=3$. So $N=49$ is a possible solution.\n\nLet's proceed with $N=49$.\nWe found $n_R = 9$.\nNow we calculate $n_{triplet}$ using $3n_{triplet} = 5n_R - 6$:\n$3n_{triplet} = 5(9) - 6 = 45 - 6 = 39$.\n$n_{triplet} = \\frac{39}{3} = 13$. This is a whole number.\n\nSo, for $N=49$:\n- Willie's share is 1 part.\n- Rastus's share is $n_R = 9$ parts.\n- Wig's share is $n_{triplet} = 13$ parts.\n- Twig's share is $n_{triplet} = 13$ parts.\n- Swig's share is $n_{triplet} = 13$ parts.\n\nLet's check the total number of parts: $1 + 9 + 13 + 13 + 13 = 1 + 9 + 39 = 49$. This matches $N=49$.\nAlso, all work rates must be positive.\nLet $z > 0$.\n$y = \\frac{N+5}{6}z = \\frac{49+5}{6}z = \\frac{54}{6}z = 9z$. Since $z>0$, $y>0$.\n$x = 5y-6z = 5(9z)-6z = 45z-6z = 39z$. Since $z>0$, $x>0$.\nThe work rate of each triplet is $w_1 = x/3 = 39z/3 = 13z$. This is also positive.\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe question is: How many parts did each son get?\nThe sons are Rastus, Wig, Twig, and Swig.\n- Rastus got $n_R = 9$ parts.\n- Wig got $n_{triplet} = 13$ parts.\n- Twig got $n_{triplet} = 13$ parts.\n- Swig got $n_{triplet} = 13$ parts.\n\nThis can be stated as: Rastus received 9 parts, and Wig, Twig, and Swig each received 13 parts.\n\nFinal Answer: Rastus got 9 parts. Wig, Twig, and Swig each got 13 parts.\nThe question seems to ask for the number of parts for each of the four sons. So we should list them or state them clearly.\n\nRastus: 9 parts.\nWig: 13 parts.\nTwig: 13 parts.\nSwig: 13 parts.\n\nFinal output format requirement: \"", "Status": true}

H * 4 = 30, so H = 30/4 = 7.5 (not an integer).\n  - If E = 6, then E - 1 = 5. H * 5 = 30, so H = 30/5 = 6. But E=6, so H=E, which is not allowed as letters must represent distinct numbers.\n  - If E = 7, then E - 1 = 6. H * 6 = 30, so H = 30/6 = 5.\n    This gives D=3, E=7, H=5. These values {3, 5, 7} are distinct and are from the set of remaining digits. This is a valid assignment.\n\nCase 2: D = 5.\nThen H * (E - 1) = 10 * 5 = 50.\nH and E must be chosen from {3, 6, 7}.\n  - If E = 3, then E - 1 = 2. H * 2 = 50, so H = 25 (not a digit).\n  - If E = 6, then E - 1 = 5. H * 5 = 50, so H = 10 (not a digit).\n  - If E = 7, then E - 1 = 6. H * 6 = 50, so H = 50/6 (not an integer).\nSo D cannot be 5.\n\nCase 3: D = 6.\nThen H * (E - 1) = 10 * 6 = 60.\nH and E must be chosen from {3, 5, 7}.\n  - If E = 3, then E - 1 = 2. H * 2 = 60, so H = 30 (not a digit).\n  - If E = 5, then E - 1 = 4. H * 4 = 60, so H = 15 (not a digit).\n  - If E = 7, then E - 1 = 6. H * 6 = 60, so H = 10 (not a digit).\nSo D cannot be 6.\n\nCase 4: D = 7.\nThen H * (E - 1) = 10 * 7 = 70.\nH and E must be chosen from {3, 5, 6}.\n  - If E = 3, then E - 1 = 2. H * 2 = 70, so H = 35 (not a digit).\n  - If E = 5, then E - 1 = 4. H * 4 = 70, so H = 70/4 = 17.5 (not an integer).\n  - If E = 6, then E - 1 = 5. H * 5 = 70, so H = 14 (not a digit).\nSo D cannot be 7.\n\nThus, the only possibility is D=3, E=7, H=5.\n\nStep 4: Determine the value of B.\nWe have found:\nA = 2\nC = 8\nD = 3\nE = 7\nF = 4\nG = 1\nH = 5\nThe digits used are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}.

Replace $1$ and $x_j$ with $1+x_j$. The sum remains the same. The product changes from $1 \\cdot x_j \\cdot (\\text{other factors})$ to $(1+x_j) \\cdot (\\text{other factors})$. Since $x_j$ is a positive integer, $x_j \\ge 1$. Then $1+x_j > x_j$. So the product increases. For example, if we have $\\{1, k, \\ldots\\}$, the sum is $1+k+\\ldots$. The product is $k \\cdot \\ldots$. If we change to $\\{k+1, \\ldots\\}$, the sum is $k+1+\\ldots$. The product is $(k+1) \\cdot \\ldots$. Since $k+1 > k$, the product increases.

The product changes from $k$ to $2(k-2)$.\nCompare $k$ with $2(k-2) = 2k-4$.\n$2k-4 > k \\iff k > 4$.\nSo, if $x_i > 4$, replacing it with $2$ and $x_i-2$ increases the product.

We have three - the distance from the train to A, which I will call x; the distance from A to B, which I will call y; and the rate of the running man, in kph, which I will call z.\nThe man is 3/8 the distance of A to B (which is y), so he is 3/8 y from A and 5/8 y from B (please note that the 'y' belongs in the numerator - the top of the fraction - not the bottom, so to be truly technical it is (3y)/8 and (5y)/8).\nThe time it takes the train to reach A is its rate divided by the distance, or 80/x.  The time it takes the man to reach A would then be z/(3/8 y).  Since they meet there,  80/x = z / (3/8 y).  Solve for z, and simplify, to get z = 30y /x.\nThe time it takes the train to reach B is 80/(x + y), and the time it takes the man is z/(5/8 y).  Again, since they meet there, 80/(x + y) = z/(5/8 y), and we get z = 50y /(x + y).\nSet these two z-values equal to each other, so that 30y /x = 50y / (x + y), and cross-multiply.  You then get 30xy + 30 y^2 = 50xy.  Regroup to get 30y^2 = 20xy.  Divide by 30y to get y = 2/3 x.  Don't worry about y being 0 and making this pointless - y is a distance, and distances *can't* be 0, right?\nSo what does that do for us?  Well, y is 2/3 of x.  That means that the distance from A to B is 2/3 the distance from the train to A.  Now, the man himself is 3/8 the distance from A to B (y), so he is 3/8 of 2/3 x away from A, or just 1/4 x away from A.  So, in the time it takes the train to travel x, the man travels 1/4 x.  So the man is running at 1/4 the speed of the train, or 20kph.\nFeel like checking?  OK.  The train travels x and 2/3 x to get to B, or just 5/3 x.

Of those six quantities (including any zeros), there is one -- and ONLY one -- distinct triplet that can be made into a true multiplication sentence.

Therefore, if there are two or more 0 quantities, any of the other three could be multiplied by one of the 0's, using the other 0 for the result. This means that there would be more than one triplet that fits the rule. So we know that exactly 5 of the 6 denominations are used.\nIf a $100 bill is used, there are only two combinations that have the proper total quantity of bills and dollar sum, but they both involve two 0-quantities.

Let's explore this.\n\nLet's assume that $x$ is a number whose decimal digits are $d_k d_{k-1} \\dots d_1 d_0$. This means $x = d_k \\cdot 10^k + d_{k-1} \\cdot 10^{k-1} + \\dots + d_1 \\cdot 10^1 + d_0 \\cdot 10^0$.\nLet's hypothesize that $y$ is obtained by interpreting these same digits $d_k d_{k-1} \\dots d_1 d_0$ as digits in a different base, say base $b$. So, $y = d_k \\cdot b^k + d_{k-1} \\cdot b^{k-1} + \\dots + d_1 \\cdot b^1 + d_0 \\cdot b^0$.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the given pairs:\n\nPair 1: $(1, 1)$\n$x=1$. The decimal representation is just $1$. So $d_0=1$.\nThen $y = d_0 \\cdot b^0 = 1 \\cdot b^0 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nThis pair $(1,1)$ is consistent with the hypothesis for any base $b$.\n\nPair 2: $(10, 4)$\n$x=10$. The decimal digits are $d_1=1, d_0=0$.\nSo $y = d_1 \\cdot b^1 + d_0 \\cdot b^0 = 1 \\cdot b + 0 \\cdot 1 = b$.\nWe are given $y=4$. So, $b=4$.\nThis suggests that the base might be 4. Let's test this hypothesis ($b=4$) with the remaining pairs. For this to be valid, all decimal digits of $x$ must be less than $b=4$.\n\nPair 3: $(30, 12)$\n$x=30$. The decimal digits are $d_1=3, d_0=0$. These digits (3 and 0) are less than 4, so they are valid digits in base 4.\nAccording to our hypothesis with $b=4$, $y = d_1 \\cdot 4^1 + d_0 \\cdot 4^0 = 3 \\cdot 4 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 12$.\nThe given $y$ is $12$.

This matches.\n\nAll five pairs satisfy the relationship that if the decimal representation of $x$ is $d_k d_{k-1} \\dots d_0$, then $y$ is the value of the base-4 number $(d_k d_{k-1} \\dots d_0)_4$. In other words, if $x = \\sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i$, then $y = \\sum_{i=0}^k d_i 4^i$.\nThe decimal digits of all given $x$ values ($1, \\{1,0\\}, \\{3,0\\}, \\{1,0,0\\}, \\{1,0,0,0\\}$ respectively) are all less than 4, which makes them valid digits in base 4.\n\nSo, the relationship is: The second number ($y$) is the result of interpreting the decimal digits of the first number ($x$) as the digits of a number in base 4.\n\nLet's verify this interpretation once more:\n- For $(1, 1)$: $x=1_{10}$. $y=1_4 = 1$.\n- For $(10, 4)$: $x=10_{10}$.

So $y=(30)_4 = 3 \\cdot 4^1 + 0 \\cdot 4^0 = 12$.\n- For $(100, 16)$: $x=100_{10}$. We treat \"100\" as \"one-zero-zero in base 4\". So $y=(100)_4 = 1 \\cdot 4^2 + 0 \\cdot 4^1 + 0 \\cdot 4^0 = 16$.\n- For $(1000, 64)$: $x=1000_{10}$. We treat \"1000\" as \"one-zero-zero-zero in base 4\".

This is a Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5).\n\nHint for 100: 100 = 36 + 64\nNotice that 36 and 64 are also perfect squares:\n36 = 6\u00b2\n64 = 8\u00b2\nSo, 100 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2. This can be written as 10\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2. This is a Pythagorean triple (6, 8, 10), which is a multiple of (3, 4, 5), specifically (2*3, 2*4, 2*5).\n\nBased on the hints, the common property seems to be that each of these numbers (which are perfect squares themselves) can be expressed as the sum of two other perfect squares.\nLet's check this property for the remaining numbers:\n\n3) 169\nWe know 169 = 13\u00b2. We need to see if 169 can be written as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 for some integers a and b.\nWe are looking for a Pythagorean triple where 13 is the hypotenuse.\nLet's try some squares:\nIf a = 1, a\u00b2 = 1. Then b\u00b2 = 169 - 1 = 168 (not a perfect square).\nIf a = 2, a\u00b2 = 4. Then b\u00b2 = 169 - 4 = 165 (not a perfect square).\nIf a = 3, a\u00b2 = 9. Then b\u00b2 = 169 - 9 = 160 (not a perfect square).\nIf a = 4, a\u00b2 = 16. Then b\u00b2 = 169 - 16 = 153 (not a perfect square).\nIf a = 5, a\u00b2 = 25. Then b\u00b2 = 169 - 25 = 144.\nSince 144 = 12\u00b2, this works!\nSo, 169 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2. This can be written as 13\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2. This is a Pythagorean triple (5, 12, 13).\n\n4) 225\nWe know 225 = 15\u00b2.

Then b\u00b2 = 225 - 1 = 224 (not a perfect square).\n...\nWe might recognize that (3, 4, 5) is a primitive Pythagorean triple.\nMultiplying by 3, we get (3*3, 3*4, 3*5) = (9, 12, 15).\nLet's check: 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 81 + 144 = 225.\nThis works!\nSo, 225 = 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2.

This is a Pythagorean triple (9, 12, 15).\n\nSo, the common property, besides being perfect squares, is that each of these numbers can be expressed as the sum of two other (non-zero) perfect squares.\nIn other words, for each number N in the list, N = c\u00b2 for some integer c, and also N = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 for some integers a and b (where a and b are non-zero). This means c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, so (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple, and N is the square of the hypotenuse of such a triple.\n\nLet's summarize:\n1) 25 = 5\u00b2 and 25 = 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2\n2) 100 = 10\u00b2 and 100 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2\n3) 169 = 13\u00b2 and 169 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2\n4) 225 = 15\u00b2 and 225 = 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2\n\nThe common property is that each number is the sum of two perfect squares. (This statement implicitly includes the fact that the number itself is a perfect square which is the sum of two other perfect squares, thus forming a Pythagorean relationship).\nMore precisely, each number is a perfect square whose square root is the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triple (with integer sides).\nOr, each number can be written as the sum of two (non-zero) perfect squares.\n\nFermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that an odd prime p can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if p \u2261 1 (mod 4). A positive integer n can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if the prime factorization of n has no prime p \u2261 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power.\nLet's check our numbers:\n25 = 5\u00b2. Prime factors of 5 are 5. 5 \u2261 1 (mod 4). So 5 can be written as sum of two squares: 5 = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2. Then 25 = 5\u00b2 = (1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2)\u00b2 is not what we are looking for. We are looking for 25 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\nThe theorem applies to whether the number itself can be written as the sum of two squares. All these numbers can be.\n25 = 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 (Correct)\n100 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 (or 10\u00b2 + 0\u00b2, but the hint implies two non-zero squares). Also 100 = 10\u00b2. The prime factorization of 100 is 2\u00b2 * 5\u00b2. No prime p \u2261 3 (mod 4) is raised to an odd power. So 100 can be written as a sum of two squares.\n169 = 13\u00b2. 13 is a prime and 13 \u2261 1 (mod 4). So 13 can be written as sum of two squares: 13 = 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2. Then 169 = 13\u00b2 = (2\u00b2+3\u00b2)\u00b2 is not what we want. We want 169 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. We found 169 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2. The prime factorization of 169 is 13\u00b2. No prime p \u2261 3 (mod 4) is raised to an odd power. So 169 can be written as a sum of two squares.\n225 = 3\u00b2 * 5\u00b2. The prime 3 \u2261 3 (mod 4) is raised to an even power (2). So 225 can be written as sum of two squares. We found 225 = 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2.\n\nThe property derived from the hint is that these numbers, N, are perfect squares, say N = c\u00b2, and c\u00b2 can be written as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 where a and b are non-zero integers.\nThis is equivalent to saying that the square root of each number is the hypotenuse of an integer-sided right triangle (a Pythagorean triple).\n\nThe question asks \"What do these numbers have in common, *besides* being perfect squares?\"\nThe common property is: Each number can be expressed as the sum of two (other) non-zero perfect squares.\n\nLet's consider the square roots: 5, 10, 13, 15.\nFor 5: 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\nFor 10: 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = 10\u00b2\nFor 13: 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 13\u00b2\nFor 15: 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 15\u00b2\nSo, the square root of each number is the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triple.\nThis means the numbers themselves are the square of such a hypotenuse.\nSo, each number (which is c\u00b2) can be written as a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, where a, b, c form a Pythagorean triple.\n\nThe property is: Each number is the sum of two (non-zero) perfect squares.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe numbers are 25, 100, 169, 225.\nThey are all perfect squares: 5\u00b2, 10\u00b2, 13\u00b2, 15\u00b2.\nThe hint shows:\n25 = 16 + 9 = 4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2\n100 = 36 + 64 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2\nContinuing this pattern:\n169 = 13\u00b2. We found 169 = 25 + 144 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2.\n225 = 15\u00b2. We found 225 = 81 + 144 = 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2.\nTherefore, besides being perfect squares, each of these numbers can be expressed as the sum of two other (non-zero) perfect squares.\n\nThis means that if N is one of the numbers, then N = c\u00b2 for some integer c, and N = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 for some non-zero integers a and b.\nThis implies c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, which means (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple.\nSo, an equivalent statement is that the square root of each number is the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triple.\n\nThe question asks what the *numbers* have in common.\nThe numbers (25, 100, 169, 225) are sums of two perfect squares.\n25 = 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2\n100 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2\n169 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2\n225 = 9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2\n\nThis is the property indicated by the hint.\n\nFinal Answer: Each number can be expressed as the sum of two other (non-zero) perfect squares.", "Status": true}

So there are (n-k) - 0 + 1 = n-k+1 possible starting positions.\nSimilarly, in the y-direction, there are n-k+1 possible starting positions.\nAnd in the z-direction, there are n-k+1 possible starting positions.\nTherefore, the number of cubes of side length k is (n-k+1)^3.\n\nTo find the total number of cubes, we need to sum the number of cubes of all possible side lengths k from 1 to n.\nTotal number of cubes = Sum_{k=1 to n} (n-k+1)^3.\n\nLet j = n-k+1.\nWhen k=1, j = n-1+1 = n.\nWhen k=n, j = n-n+1 = 1.\nAs k goes from 1 to n, j goes from n to 1.\nSo, the sum can be rewritten as:\nTotal number of cubes = Sum_{j=1 to n} j^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3.\n\nWe are given the hint: For 1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3, use (1 + 2 + ... + n)^2.\nWe also know the formula for the sum of the first n integers: 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2.\nTherefore, 1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = (n(n+1)/2)^2.\n\nIn this problem, n = 12.\nSo, the total number of cubes is (12(12+1)/2)^2.\nFirst, calculate 12(12+1)/2:\n12(12+1)/2 = 12 * 13 / 2 = 6 * 13 = 78.\nNow, square this result:\nTotal number of cubes = 78^2.\n78^2 = 78 * 78.\n   78\n x 78\n-----\n  624  (8 * 78)\n5460 (70 * 78)\n-----\n6084\n\nSo, the number you should say for the new technology to work is 6084.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6084}$\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = 12\n    sum_of_first_n_integers = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    total_number_of_cubes = sum_of_first_n_integers ** 2\n    return total_number_of_cubes\n\nresult = solve()\nprint(result)\n\n# Check calculation of 78^2\nprint(78*78)\n```", "Status": true}

We are given a list of distances to other countries:\n*   Australia - 500 miles\n*   Peru - 8,000 miles\n*   India - 4,500 miles\n*   Scotland - 9,500 miles\n\nWe are also given a hint: \"The full length of the word does not matter--doubling the distances could make the pattern more illuminating.\"\n\nStep 2: Apply the hint to double the distances.\nLet's double the listed distances for each country:\n*   Australia: 500 miles * 2 = 1,000 miles\n*   Peru: 8,000 miles * 2 = 16,000 miles\n*   India: 4,500 miles * 2 = 9,000 miles\n*   Scotland: 9,500 miles * 2 = 19,000 miles\n\nStep 3: Look for a pattern relating the country name to the doubled distance.\nThe hint also states, \"The full length of the word does not matter.\" This suggests we should look at a specific feature of the country name, possibly the first letter, last letter, or some other property not related to its overall length. Let's consider the first letter of each country.\n\n*   Australia: First letter is 'A'.\n*   Peru: First letter is 'P'.\n*   India: First letter is 'I'.\n*   Scotland: First letter is 'S'.\n\nStep 4: Determine the alphabetical position of these first letters.\nWe assign a numerical value to each letter based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...).\n*   Position of 'A' = 1\n*   Position of 'P': A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7), H(8), I(9), J(10), K(11), L(12), M(13), N(14), O(15), P(16). So, position of 'P' = 16.\n*   Position of 'I': A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7), H(8), I(9). So, position of 'I' = 9.\n*   Position of 'S': A(1)...P(16), Q(17), R(18), S(19). So, position of 'S' = 19.\n\nStep 5: Relate the alphabetical positions to the doubled distances.\nLet's compare the alphabetical positions of the first letters with the doubled distances:\n*   Australia: First letter 'A' (position 1). Doubled distance = 1,000.  We see that 1 * 1,000 = 1,000.\n*   Peru: First letter 'P' (position 16). Doubled distance = 16,000. We see that 16 * 1,000 = 16,000.\n*   India: First letter 'I' (position 9). Doubled distance = 9,000. We see that 9 * 1,000 = 9,000.\n*   Scotland: First letter 'S' (position 19). Doubled distance = 19,000. We see that 19 * 1,000 = 19,000.\n\nThe pattern appears to be: Doubled Distance = (Alphabetical position of the first letter of the country name) * 1,000.\nThis means the original listed faulty distance is: Listed Distance = (Alphabetical position of the first letter of the country name) * 500.\n\nStep 6: Apply this pattern to find the listed distance for France.\nThe country in question is France.\nThe first letter of \"France\" is 'F'.\nWe need to find the alphabetical position of 'F':\nA(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6).\nThe alphabetical position of 'F' is 6.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the listed distance for France using the identified pattern.\nListed Distance for France = (Alphabetical position of 'F') * 500\nListed Distance for France = 6 * 500\nListed Distance for France = 3,000 miles.\n\nTherefore, the electronic world atlas listed France as being 3,000 miles away.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{3000 miles}}$.", "Status": true}

The triple is (10, 10, 10).\n\nThe factors A = 15 and A = 30 are not possible because they violate A \u2264 10.\nAlternatively, if A = 15, then 1 + k + m = 30/15 = 2, so k + m = 1. Since k and m must be positive integers (k \u2265 1, m \u2265 1), k + m \u2265 2. Thus, there are no solutions for k and m. The formula 30/A - 2 gives 30/15 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0.\nIf A = 30, then 1 + k + m = 30/30 = 1, so k + m = 0. Again, no positive integer solutions for k and m. The formula 30/A - 2 gives 30/30 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1, which correctly indicates 0 solutions as the number of solutions cannot be negative.\n\nThe total number of ordered triples (A, B, C) is the sum of the number of solutions for each valid A:\nTotal = 28 (for A=1) + 13 (for A=2) + 8 (for A=3) + 4 (for A=5) + 3 (for A=6) + 1 (for A=10)\nTotal = 28 + 13 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 57.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{57}$", "Status": true}

Here's one way to do it, following the hint that division is needed:\n\nStep 1: Understand the goal.\nWe need to use exactly four instances of the digit 7 and any necessary mathematical symbols to form an expression that evaluates to 100.\n\nStep 2: Utilize the hint \"Division is needed\".\nLet's explore how division can help. A common technique in such puzzles is to use decimal points with division.\n\nStep 3: Form the number 10 using two 7s.\nConsider the first 7. If we divide it by \".7\" (which is 0.7 or seven-tenths), we get:\n`7 / .7`\nTo evaluate this, `.7` can be written as `7/10`.\nSo, `7 / .7 = 7 / (7/10) = 7 * (10/7)`.\nThe 7s cancel out: `7 * (10/7) = 10`.\nSo, we have used two 7s (one '7' and one '7' in '.7') to make the number 10.\n\nStep 4: Repeat Step 3 with the remaining two 7s.\nWe have two 7s left. We can use them in the exact same way to form another 10:\n`7 / .7 = 10`.\nNow we have used all four 7s. We used two 7s to get the first 10, and another two 7s to get the second 10.\n\nStep 5: Combine the two 10s to make 100.\nWe have two results of 10. To get 100, we can multiply them:\n`10 * 10 = 100`.\n\nStep 6: Write the complete expression.\nPutting it all together, the expression using four 7s is:\n`(7 / .7) * (7 / .7)`\nLet's verify:\n`(7 / .7) * (7 / .7) = 10 * 10 = 100`.\n\nThis solution uses four 7s, division signs, decimal points, parentheses (for clarity of operations, though not strictly necessary depending on order of operations if multiplication and division are done left to right and have equal precedence), and a multiplication sign.\n\nAnother common solution is:\n`(77 - 7) / .7`\n1.  `77 - 7 = 70` (This uses three 7s: two for '77' and one for '7')\n2.  `70 / .7` (This uses the fourth 7 in '.7')\n3.  `70 / .7 = 70 / (7/10) = 70 * (10/7) = (70/7) * 10 = 10 * 10 = 100`.\n\nYet another solution:\n`7 / .07 + 7 - 7`\n1. `7 / .07 = 7 / (7/100) = 7 * (100/7) = 100` (This uses two 7s: one '7' and one '7' in '.07')\n2. We have 100 and two 7s remaining.\n3. `100 + 7 - 7 = 100 + 0 = 100` (This uses the other two 7s).\n\nAny of these solutions fulfill the conditions.

The units digit of 3Y must be Y. Let k1 be the carry to the tens column.\n    So, 3Y = Y + 10k1.\n    This simplifies to 2Y = 10k1.\n    Since Y is a non-zero digit, Y is in {1, 2, ..., 9}. So 2Y is in {2, 4, ..., 18}.\n    For 2Y to be a multiple of 10, 2Y must be 10.\n    So, 2Y = 10, which means Y = 5.\n    And k1 = 1 (the carry to the tens column).\n    We have Y=5.

But W must be a non-zero digit (stated in the hint and problem statement). So F=6 is not possible.\n    - If F=8: 3(8) = 24. So 24 = W+18 => W = 6.\n      Let's check this. W=6.\n      The digits are Y=5, A=2, L=7, F=8, W=6.\n      These are {5,2,7,8,6}. All are distinct. All are non-zero. This is a valid solution.\n    - If F=9: 3(9) = 27.

This number can be expressed as follows.\na*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e =\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e .\n9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) must be divisible by 9 because it is a factor of 9. So if a+b+c+d+e is also a factor of 9 then the entire number must be a factor of 9. Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9.\nThe smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111. Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": "Let N be the integer we are looking for. The problem states several conditions for N:\n1.  N is an integer greater than 0.\n2.  N can be written entirely with zeros and ones.\n3.  N is evenly divisible by 225.\n4.  We are looking for the smallest such N.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the divisibility condition. N must be divisible by 225.\nThe prime factorization of 225 is 3^2 * 5^2 = 9 * 25.\nSince 9 and 25 are coprime (gcd(9, 25) = 1), N must be divisible by both 9 and 25.\n\nDivisibility by 25:\nA number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 25. The possible last two digits are 00, 25, 50, 75.\nSince N can only be written with zeros and ones, the only possibility for the last two digits is 00.\nSo, N must end in \"00\".\n\nDivisibility by 9:\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\nThe digits of N can only be 0 or 1. So, the sum of the digits of N is equal to the number of ones in N.\nLet S(N) be the sum of digits of N. S(N) must be a multiple of 9.\nSince N > 0, N must contain at least one digit '1'. So S(N) must be a positive multiple of 9.\nThe smallest positive multiple of 9 is 9. So, N must contain at least nine '1's.\n\nCombining these conditions:\n- N must end in \"00\".\n- N must contain at least nine '1's.\n- All digits of N must be '0' or '1'.\n- N must be greater than 0, which implies its first digit must be '1'.\n\nWe want the smallest such integer N. To make N small, we generally want it to have the fewest possible digits.\nLet's determine the minimum number of digits for N.\nN must end in \"00\". These are two digits.\nN must contain at least nine '1's.\nThe first digit of N must be '1'. This is one of the nine '1's.\nSo, N has a '1' at the beginning, then some other digits, then \"00\" at the end.\nLet N have k digits. The first digit is 1. The last two digits are 00.\nThe remaining k-1-2 = k-3 digits are between the first '1' and the trailing \"00\".\nThe number of '1's must be at least 9.\nSo, N consists of at least nine '1's and two '0's (the trailing \"00\").\nThis means N must have at least 9 + 2 = 11 digits.\n\nLet's try to construct an 11-digit number satisfying the conditions.\nIf N has 11 digits, its form is d_10 d_9 d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0.\nWe know d_0 = 0 and d_1 = 0.\nWe know d_10 = 1 (first digit must be '1').\nThe number of '1's must be exactly 9 for an 11-digit number, because if it were 18 or more, N would need more digits. S(N) = 9.\nSo, there are nine '1's in total. Since d_10=1, the remaining 8 '1's must be placed in the digits d_9, d_8, ..., d_2.\nThere are 9 positions from d_10 down to d_2 available for '1's.\nd_10 d_9 d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_3 d_2 must contain nine '1's. Since there are 9 such digits, all of them must be '1'.\nSo, d_10=1, d_9=1, d_8=1, d_7=1, d_6=1, d_5=1, d_4=1, d_3=1, d_2=1.\nThis means the number is 11111111100.\n\nLet's check this number N = 11,111,111,100:\n1.  It is greater than 0. (Yes)\n2.  It is written entirely with zeros and ones. (Yes)\n3.  Is it divisible by 225?\n    -   It ends in \"00\", so it is divisible by 25. (Yes)\n    -   The sum of its digits is 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 9. Since 9 is divisible by 9, the number is divisible by 9. (Yes)\n    -   Since it's divisible by both 9 and 25, and gcd(9,25)=1, it is divisible by 225. (Yes)\n\nNow, we need to confirm it's the smallest such integer.\nWe established that N must have at least 11 digits.\nOur candidate N = 11,111,111,100 has 11 digits.\nIf there were any other 11-digit number satisfying the conditions, it would have to be formed as follows:\n- Ends in \"00\".\n- Starts with \"1\".\n- Has nine '1's in total.\nThis means the first 9 digits (d_10 to d_2) must all be '1's. This leads uniquely to 11,111,111,100.\nAny number with more than 11 digits would be larger than this 11-digit number (e.g., the smallest 12-digit number starting with '1' is 10,000,000,000,00, which is 10^11, while 11,111,111,100 is approx 1.1 * 10^10).\nThe smallest 12-digit number composed of 0s and 1s, ending in 00, and with nine 1s would be of the form 1...00. The part before 00 would have 10 digits. It must contain nine 1s, meaning one 0. To make this number smallest, the 0 should be placed as far to the left as possible (but after the leading 1). So, this would be 101111111100. This number is 101,111,111,100, which is larger than 11,111,111,100.\n\nTherefore, the number 11,111,111,100 is the smallest integer satisfying all conditions.\n\nFinal verification:\nN = 11,111,111,100\nN / 225 = (11,111,111,100 / 9) / 25\n11,111,111,100 / 9 = 1,234,567,900\n1,234,567,900 / 25 = 49,382,716\nSince N/225 is an integer (49,382,716), N is evenly divisible by 225.\n\nThe reasoning is complete and sound.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11111111100}$.", "Status": true}

It is one greater than the age of the younger person ($x+1$).\n2. It is one less than the age of the older person ($(x+2)-1 = x+1$).\n3. It is the arithmetic mean (average) of the two ages: $(x + (x+2))/2 = (2x+2)/2 = x+1$.\n4. It is the integer exactly between the two ages $x$ and $x+2$.\n\nAny of these descriptions for the second thing would be valid. The most general and symmetric description is probably using the arithmetic mean.\n\nSo, the two things Rudy could have realized about these numbers are:\n1. The number is always a perfect square.\n2. The positive square root of this number is always the arithmetic mean of the two ages being multiplied.

So:\n$x_1 = x_1$\n$x_2 = x_1 + d$\n$x_3 = x_1 + 2d$\n$x_4 = x_1 + 3d$\n$x_5 = x_1 + 4d$\n\nThe total amount of corn is 100 measures. So, the sum of these amounts is 100:\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 100$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $x_1$ and $d$:\n$x_1 + (x_1 + d) + (x_1 + 2d) + (x_1 + 3d) + (x_1 + 4d) = 100$\n$5x_1 + (0+1+2+3+4)d = 100$\n$5x_1 + 10d = 100$\nDividing the entire equation by 5, we get:\n$x_1 + 2d = 20$ (Equation 1)\nNotice that $x_3 = x_1 + 2d$, so this equation also tells us that $x_3 = 20$.\n\nThe second condition given is: \"The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.\"\nLet $S_{12}$ be the sum of corn for the first two workers: $S_{12} = x_1 + x_2$.\nLet $S_{345}$ be the sum of corn for the other three workers: $S_{345} = x_3 + x_4 + x_5$.\nThe condition \"seven times less\" means $S_{12} = S_{345} / 7$.\nSo, $7 S_{12} = S_{345}$.

Substitute this into Equation 1:\n$x_1 + (11x_1) = 20$\n$12x_1 = 20$\n$x_1 = 20/12 = 5/3$\n\nNow that we have $x_1$, we can find $d$ using Equation 3:\n$2d = 11x_1 = 11(5/3) = 55/3$\n$d = (55/3) / 2 = 55/6$\n\nNow we can find the amount of corn for each worker:\n$x_1 = 5/3$\n$x_2 = x_1 + d = 5/3 + 55/6 = 10/6 + 55/6 = 65/6$\n$x_3 = x_1 + 2d = 5/3 + 2(55/6) = 5/3 + 55/3 = 60/3 = 20$ (As expected from $x_1+2d=20$)\n$x_4 = x_1 + 3d = 5/3 + 3(55/6) = 5/3 + 55/2 = 10/6 + 165/6 = 175/6$\n$x_5 = x_1 + 4d = 5/3 + 4(55/6) = 5/3 + 2(55/3) = 5/3 + 110/3 = 115/3$\n\nLet's check these values:\nSum: $5/3 + 65/6 + 20 + 175/6 + 115/3 = 10/6 + 65/6 + 120/6 + 175/6 + 230/6 = (10+65+120+175+230)/6 = 600/6 = 100$.

Although he was quite tired out by the sheer length of the journey, he never wanted to miss a chance to catch me off guard with my math. As soon as he came in, he lay down a puzzle before me which quite took me by surprise.\nHe said his train journey had taken him through six stations: Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp, culminating in the Rudolf Railway terminal (named after my grandfather Rudolf, the world-famous RomanKachi), from where he'd taken a cab to my house. He was one amongst the few people in the train as it had chugged into Maver.\nThese were his observations :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nHe wanted to know how many people (including him) were on the train before it had reached the Maver railway station if there were 227 people on it when it chugged into Rudolf (227 includes the people getting in and out at Rudolf).\nIt didn't take me long to disappoint him by finding the answer. Can you recreate history by solving my dear friend Tweeto's puzzle?\n Hint: Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Hint": "Primes differ by at least 10 from one another, so the ones place digits of the primes at the earlier stations should be less than those at the later stations", "Human Solution": "The observations given are :-\n1) At each of the stations Maver, Willow, Wonderland, Doku, Lemp and Rudolf, twice as many people got in as those that got down.\n2) Further, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, and so on up to in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf in the order of the stations mentioned above.\n3) Also, the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20.\n4) Finally, the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together was an even number.\nFrom observations 1 and 3, since the difference between the number of people getting in at any two consecutive stations was at least 20, it means that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10.\nLet us start with the people getting down at Rudolf.\nFrom observation 2, the number of people getting down at each of these stations were all prime numbers - one each in between 0 and 10 at Maver, in between 10 and 20 at Willow, in between 20 and 30 at Wonderland, in between 30 and 40 at Doku, in between 40 and 50 at Lemp, and in between 50 and 60 at Rudolf.\nHence, the number of people getting down at Rudolf should be either 53 or 59.\nIf it is 53, then the number of people getting down at Lemp should be either 43 or 41, and that at Doku has to be 31 (keeping in mind the condition that the difference between the number of people getting down at any two consecutive stations was at least 10). However, we cannot get a prime number for Wonderland in between 20 and 30 with a difference of 10 from Doku then.\nThis means that the number of people getting down at Doku must be 37 and not 31. Then, the figures for Lemp and Rudolf have to be 47 and 59 respectively. Then, we get the number of people getting down at Wonderland as 23. Now the figure for Willow can be 11 or 13. But if it is 11, we are left with no prime number for Maver (with a difference of 10). Hence, the number of people getting down at Willow must be 13.\nNow the number of people getting down at Maver can be either 2 or 3. If this figure is 2, condition 4 would be violated, since the total number of passengers getting down in all six stations together would be an odd number.
