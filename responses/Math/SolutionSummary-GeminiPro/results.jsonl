{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.\nThe island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.\nOn April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.\nIf the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?\nBonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?\n Solution: The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.\nBonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.\nAll villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:\n1) First set the starting point to one.\n2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.\n3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)\n4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.\nWhich points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.\nNote that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.\nThe routes:\nThis is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.

Straight paths connect every pair of villages, creating intersections inside the island. A courtship custom requires a suitor to travel every possible route from his village to the bride's village, with the constraint that he must *always be getting closer* to the destination village. Three sons from village A start wooing brides in villages B, C, and D (the next three clockwise) on April 1st. We need to find the number of valid routes for each son to determine their wedding dates (the day after the last trip). We also need to find the length of the longest valid route if the island's circumference is 10 miles.\n\n**Reasoning and Solution Steps:**\n\n1.  **Model the Island and Paths:**\n    *   The six villages form a regular hexagon (let's label them A to F clockwise).\n    *   Paths connect every pair of vertices (villages).\n    *   These paths intersect inside. The solution identifies specific intersection points:\n        *   `M`: The central intersection.\n        *   `Ai`, `Bi`, etc.: The intersection closest to village A on the path AM, closest to B on BM, etc.\n        *   `ABi`, `BCi`, etc.: The intersection formed by paths like AC and BF (between villages A and B), BD and CE (between B and C), etc.\n    *   This forms a graph where villages and intersections are nodes, and path segments between them are edges.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Getting Closer\" Rule:**\n    *   The core constraint is that travel is only allowed along path segments that move the traveler strictly closer to the destination village.\n    *   Closeness is determined geometrically (e.g., using distances or right-angle projections as mentioned in the original solution, although detailed geometric checks aren't explicitly shown in the route calculation itself, it's the underlying principle).\n\n3.  **Develop a Method to Count Valid Routes:**\n    *   A dynamic programming approach is used. The number of valid routes to reach any node (village or intersection) is the sum of the valid routes to reach the adjacent nodes *from which one can travel to the current node* (meaning the adjacent node is farther from the destination).\n    *   Algorithm:\n        *   Set the starting village's route count to 1.\n        *   Identify all unvisited nodes adjacent to visited nodes that are closer to the destination.\n        *   Select the *farthest* such unvisited node from the destination.\n        *   Calculate its route count by summing the route counts of all adjacent, already visited nodes (which, by the selection process, are farther from the destination).\n        *   Repeat until the destination node's route count is calculated.\n\n4.  **Calculate Routes for Son 1 (Village A to Village B - Adjacent):**\n    *   Start: A = 1.\n    *   Farthest valid adjacent node from B: Ai. Reached only from A. Ai = 1.\n    *   Next farthest: ABi. Reached from A and Ai. ABi = A + Ai = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Next farthest: Bi. Reached only from ABi (since B is destination). Bi = ABi = 2.\n    *   Destination: B. Reached from A, ABi, and Bi. B = A + ABi + Bi = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n    *   **Result:** 5 valid routes from A to B.\n\n5.  **Calculate Routes for Son 2 (Village A to Village C - Second Village):**\n    *   Start: A = 1.\n    *   Working roughly from farthest to nearest valid nodes relative to C:\n        *   AFi = A = 1.\n        *   Fi = AFi = 1.\n        *   Ai = A + AFi = 1 + 1 = 2.\n        *   ABi = Ai + A = 2 + 1 = 3.\n        *   M = Ai + Fi = 2 + 1 = 3. (M is farther than B from C)\n        *   B = A + ABi = 1 + 3 = 4.\n        *   Bi = B + ABi + M = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10. (Bi is farther than Di from C)\n        *   Di = M = 3.\n        *   BCi = B + Bi = 4 + 10 = 14. (BCi is farther than CDi from C)\n        *   CDi = Di = 3.\n        *   Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 14 + 3 + 3 = 20.\n        *   Destination: C. Reached from B, BCi, CDi, Ci. C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 4 + 14 + 3 + 20 = 41.\n    *   **Result:** 41 valid routes from A to C.\n\n6.  **Calculate Routes for Son 3 (Village A to Village D - Opposite):**\n    *   Start: A = 1.\n    *   Use symmetry (paths/counts on the left side, e.g., via F, mirror those on the right, e.g., via B). Calculate one side and apply to both where appropriate.\n    *   F = 1, B = 1. (From A)\n    *   FAi = A + F = 1 + 1 = 2, ABi = A + B = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Ai = A + FAi + ABi = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n    *   Fi = FAi + F = 2 + 1 = 3, Bi = ABi + B = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   EFi = F + Fi = 1 + 3 = 4, BCi = B + Bi = 1 + 3 = 4.\n    *   M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.\n    *   E = F + EFi = 1 + 4 = 5, C = B + BCi = 1 + 4 = 5.\n    *   Ei = EFi + M + E = 4 + 11 + 5 = 20, Ci = BCi + M + C = 4 + 11 + 5 = 20.\n    *   DEi = E + Ei = 5 + 20 = 25, CDi = C + Ci = 5 + 20 = 25.\n    *   Di = M + DEi + CDi = 11 + 25 + 25 = 61.\n    *   Destination: D. Reached from E, C, DEi, CDi, Di. D = E + C + DEi + CDi + Di = 5 + 5 + 25 + 25 + 61 = 121.\n    *   **Result:** 121 valid routes from A to D.\n\n7.  **Determine the Wedding Dates:**\n    *   Courtship starts April 1st. The number of routes equals the number of days the son makes trips (inclusive of the first day). The wedding is the day *after* the last trip.\n    *   Son 1 (A->B): 5 routes. Last trip is 5 days from April 1st (inclusive), which is April 5th. Wedding: **April 6th**.\n    *   Son 2 (A->C): 41 routes. Last trip is 41 days from April 1st. April has 30 days. 41 - 30 = 11 days into May. Last trip is May 11th. Wedding: **May 12th**.\n    *   Son 3 (A->D): 121 routes. Last trip is 121 days from April 1st. Days in April(30) + May(31) + June(30) + July(31) = 122 days. So, 121 days ends on July 31st. Wedding: **August 1st**.\n\n8.  **Bonus Question: Longest Route Length:**\n    *   **Identify Longest Route Type:** The longest routes occur for the A->D case (opposite village) and involve a path that zig-zags near the destination, like A-B-ABi-BCi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D (and its mirror A-F-FAi-...). *Correction based on original text: The example path given is A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D, implying a jump ABi-C rather than ABi-BCi-C.* Let's assume the provided path A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D is correct within the problem's logic, even if it seems geometrically unusual without the diagram/precise rules. Let's re-examine the text's calculation. It uses A-B-ABi-BCi-C... wait, it *does* use BCi. Let's re-read the calculation part: \"A-B is 5/Pi. B-D bisects C-M, so C-Ci and Di-D are half radius. A-B + C-Ci + Di-D = diameter (10/Pi). Paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, BCi-C are sides of equilateral triangles... Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are half sides...\" This implies the path A-B + B-ABi + ABi-BCi + BCi-C + C-Ci + Ci-CDi + CDi-Di + Di-D contains these segments. Let's recalculate based on *this* interpretation.\n    *   **Calculate Geometric Values:**\n        *   Circumference C = 10 miles.\n        *   Radius R = C / (2 * Pi) = 10 / (2 * Pi) = 5/Pi miles.\n        *   Hexagon side length = Radius = 5/Pi. (This is path A-B).\n        *   The large diagonal (A-D) is the diameter = 2R = 10/Pi.\n        *   The solution identifies smaller equilateral triangles formed by intersections. The height of these is stated as R/2. For an equilateral triangle, height = side * sqrt(3)/2. So, R/2 = side * sqrt(3)/2 => side = R/sqrt(3) = (5/Pi)/sqrt(3) = 5 / (sqrt(3)*Pi). These are segments like B-ABi, ABi-BCi, BCi-C.\n        *   Segments C-Ci and Di-D are identified as half the radius = R/2 = (5/Pi)/2 = 5/(2*Pi).\n        *   Segments Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are identified as half the side of the small equilateral triangle = (1/2) * [5 / (sqrt(3)*Pi)] = 5 / (2*sqrt(3)*Pi).\n    *   **Sum Lengths for the Path A-B-ABi-BCi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D:**\n        *   A-B: R = 5/Pi\n        *   B-ABi: R/sqrt(3) = 5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   ABi-BCi: R/sqrt(3) = 5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   BCi-C: R/sqrt(3) = 5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   C-Ci: R/2 = 5/(2*Pi)\n        *   Ci-CDi: R/(2*sqrt(3)) = 5/(2*sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   CDi-Di: R/(2*sqrt(3)) = 5/(2*sqrt(3)*Pi)\n        *   Di-D: R/2 = 5/(2*Pi)\n        *   Total = R + 3 * (R/sqrt(3)) + 2 * (R/2) + 2 * (R/(2*sqrt(3)))\n        *   Total = R + sqrt(3)*R + R + R/sqrt(3)\n        *   Total = 2R + (sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3))R = 2R + (3/sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3))R = 2R + (4/sqrt(3))R\n        *   Total = R * (2 + 4/sqrt(3)) = (5/Pi) * (2 + 4/sqrt(3))\n        *   Total = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) \u2248 3.183 + 3.677 \u2248 6.86 miles.\n    *   **Result (Bonus):** The longest route is approximately **6.86 miles**.

The new number `y` can be expressed as: `y = r * 10 + d`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Equation:**\n    *   The problem states that the rotated number `y` is 1.5 times the original number `x`.\n    *   So, `y = 1.5x`.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `x` and `y`: `r * 10 + d = 1.5 * (d * 10^(k-1) + r)`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Equation (Solve for x):**\n    *   Multiply by 2 to remove the decimal: `2 * (10r + d) = 3 * (d * 10^(k-1) + r)`\n    *   `20r + 2d = 3d * 10^(k-1) + 3r`\n    *   Rearrange to isolate `r`: `17r = 3d * 10^(k-1) - 2d`\n    *   `17r = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   Now substitute `r = x - d * 10^(k-1)` back into the equation:\n    *   `17 * (x - d * 10^(k-1)) = d * (3 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   `17x - 17d * 10^(k-1) = 3d * 10^(k-1) - 2d`\n    *   `17x = 20d * 10^(k-1) - 2d`\n    *   `17x = d * (20 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   `17x = d * (2 * 10 * 10^(k-1) - 2)`\n    *   `17x = d * (2 * 10^k - 2)`\n    *   `17x = 2d * (10^k - 1)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Equation `17x = 2d * (10^k - 1)`:**\n    *   This equation relates the number `x`, its first digit `d`, and its number of digits `k`.\n    *   `10^k - 1` represents a number consisting of `k` nines (e.g., 9, 99, 999...).\n    *   Since `x`, `d`, and `k` must be integers, and 17 is a prime number that does not divide 2, `(10^k - 1)` must be divisible by 17.\n\n5.  **Connect to Repeating Decimals:**\n    *   The condition `(10^k - 1)` is divisible by 17 means `10^k \u2261 1 (mod 17)`.\n    *   This is directly related to the length of the repeating cycle (period) of the decimal expansion of `1/17`.\n    *   The period length of `1/17` is the smallest integer `k` such that `10^k \u2261 1 (mod 17)`. Calculating this (or knowing the property of prime reciprocals) reveals the period length is `k = 16`.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of digits the solution `x` can have is `k=16`.\n\n6.  **Solve for x when k=16:**\n    *   Substitute `k=16` into the equation: `17x = 2d * (10^16 - 1)`\n    *   Solve for `x`: `x = (2d/17) * (10^16 - 1)`\n    *   The term `(10^16 - 1) / 17` is precisely the integer represented by the repeating block of digits in the decimal expansion of `1/17`.\n    *   `1/17 = 0.0588235294117647...` The repeating block is `R = 0588235294117647`. (Note: Treat `R` as the integer `588235294117647`).\n    *   So, `x = 2d * R = 2d * 0588235294117647`.\n\n7.  **Determine the First Digit `d`:**\n    *   The number `x` we calculate must have `d` as its first digit.

This occurs when `d` is smallest, i.e., `d=1`.\n    *   The smallest solution is `x = 1176470588235294`.\n\n**Summary of Solution:**\n\n1.  **Algebraic Setup:** Express the original number `x` and the left-rotated number `y` using the first digit `d`, the number of digits `k`, and the remaining part `r`.\n2.  **Equation Formulation:** Set up the equation `y = 1.5x` based on the problem statement.\n3.  **Simplification:** Manipulate the equation algebraically to isolate `x`, resulting in `17x = 2d * (10^k - 1)`.\n4.  **Divisibility Condition:** Deduce that `10^k - 1` must be divisible by 17, which implies `10^k \u2261 1 (mod 17)`.\n5.  **Period Length:** Recognize that the smallest `k` satisfying this condition is the period length of the decimal expansion of `1/17`, which is `k=16`.\n6.  **Calculate Candidate `x`:** Substitute `k=16` and express `x` as `x = 2d * R`, where `R` is the integer formed by the 16 repeating digits of `1/17` (`R = 0588235294117647`).\n7.  **First Digit Constraint:** Check which values of `d` (from 1 to 9) result in a number `x` that actually starts with the digit `d`. Only `d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5` work.\n8.  **Smallest Result:** Select the smallest valid `x` by choosing the smallest valid `d`, which is `d=1`.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Ralph was impressed by the ingenuity of Rex's last attempt using clues involving prime numbers, but he thinks he's got an even better one for Rex. He tells Rex he's thinking of a 6-digit number.\n\"All of the digits are different. The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits in the number. The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.\"\n\"Take the sum of the number, the number rotated one to the left, the number rotated one to the right, the number with the first three and last three digits swapped, the number with the digit pairs rotated to the left, and the number with the digit pairs rotated to the right. The first and last digits of this sum match the last two digits of the number, in some order.\"\nRalph then asks, \"If each of the three numbers formed by the digit pairs in the number is prime, then what is the number?\"\nRex looks confused, and for a moment Ralph thinks he's finally gotten him. Then Rex smiles, scribbles a few things down on a pad of paper and then says, \"Very nice, Ralph!\"\nRex then tells Ralph his number.\nWhat did Rex say?\n(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)\n Solution: 416723\nHere's how Rex determined Ralph's number:\nThe insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Hint": "The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y).

The solution finds the number 416723 by systematically applying the given constraints to narrow down the possibilities. A key insight involves analyzing the sum of six permutations of the number's digits, which reveals a condition on the digits of the number's digital sum. This condition, combined with the prime number requirements and digit sum equalities, allows for the elimination of incorrect possibilities until only the correct number remains.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Summation Clue:**\n    *   Let the 6-digit number be ABCDEF. The problem defines a sum `T` of six numbers: ABCDEF, BCDEFA, FABCDE, DEFABC, CDEFAB, EFABCD.\n    *   When these six numbers are added column-wise, each column (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) contains all six distinct digits A, B, C, D, E, F.\n    *   The sum of digits in each column is therefore the digital sum of the original number, let's call it `S = A+B+C+D+E+F`.\n    *   The total sum `T` is equivalent to `S * 111111`.\n    *   The clue states that the first and last digits of `T` match the digits of the number formed by the last two digits (EF). Let `S = 10X + Y` (where X and Y are the digits of `S`). The first digit of `T` will be X and the last digit Y *only if* there is no significant carry-over in the multiplication `S * 111111`. This occurs when the sum of the digits of `S`, `X + Y`, is less than 10.\n\n2.  **Determine Possible Values for the Digital Sum (S):**\n    *   The clue states `S` equals the number formed by the last two digits, `10E + F`. Let this number be `EF`.\n    *   Since EF must be formed from two distinct digits of the 6-digit number, and the pair EF must form a prime number, `S` itself must be a prime number formed by the last two digits.\n    *   The minimum digital sum S (using 0,1,2,3,4,5) is 15. The maximum (using 9,8,7,6,5,4) is 39.\n    *   The primes `S` between 15 and 39 are: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.\n    *   Apply the condition `X + Y < 10` (where `S = 10X + Y`):\n        *   17 -> 1+7 = 8 (< 10) -> Possible\n        *   19 -> 1+9 = 10 (not < 10) -> Impossible\n        *   23 -> 2+3 = 5 (< 10) -> Possible\n        *   29 -> 2+9 = 11 (not < 10) -> Impossible\n        *   31 -> 3+1 = 4 (< 10) -> Possible\n        *   37 -> 3+7 = 10 (not < 10) -> Impossible\n    *   So, the possible values for S (and the prime EF) are 17, 23, or 31.\n\n3.  **Apply the Digit Sum Equality (A+B = E+F):**\n    *   The clue states the sum of the first two digits (A+B) equals the sum of the last two digits (E+F).\n    *   Test S=31 (EF=31): E=3, F=1. E+F = 3+1 = 4. So A+B must equal 4. The pair AB must form a prime number using distinct digits not already used (3, 1). Possible pairs (A,B) summing to 4 are (4,0) or (0,4). Neither 40 nor 04 is prime. So S cannot be 31.\n    *   Test S=17 (EF=17): E=1, F=7. E+F = 1+7 = 8. So A+B must equal 8. The digits used are {A, B, C, D, 1, 7} and they must sum to 17. The available digits for A, B are {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Pairs (A,B) summing to 8 are (8,0), (6,2), (5,3). None of 80, 08, 62, 26, 35 are prime. Only 53 is prime. So maybe A=5, B=3. Digits used {5, 3, 1, 7}. Sum=16. Remaining digits C, D must sum to S - (A+B+E+F) = 17 - (8+8) = 1. The only distinct digits summing to 1 are 1 and 0. But 1 is already used (E=1). So S cannot be 17. (Alternatively, the solution notes the set of digits must sum to 17. Only {0,1,2,3,4,7} works for S=17 and contains 1,7. The remaining {0,2,3,4} have no pair summing to E+F=8.)\n\n4.  **Determine the Full Number for S=23:**\n    *   The only remaining possibility is S=23 (EF=23). E=2, F=3. E+F = 2+3 = 5. So A+B must equal 5.\n    *   The pair AB must form a prime number using distinct digits not already used (2, 3). Available digits {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Pairs (A,B) summing to 5 are (5,0) and (4,1).\n    *   (5,0): AB=05 (prime, but A=0 means it's a 5-digit number, reject) or AB=50 (not prime).\n    *   (4,1): AB=41 (prime!) or AB=14 (not prime). So A=4, B=1.\n    *   Digits used so far: {4, 1, 2, 3}. These are A, B, E, F.\n    *   The total digital sum S is 23. The sum of the middle digits C+D must be S - (A+B) - (E+F) = 23 - 5 - 5 = 13.\n    *   The pair CD must form a prime number using distinct digits not already used ({4, 1, 2, 3}). Available digits: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n    *   Pairs (C,D) summing to 13 are (5,8) and (6,7).\n    *   (5,8): CD=58 (not prime) or CD=85 (not prime).\n    *   (6,7): CD=67 (prime!) or CD=76 (not prime). So C=6, D=7.\n    *   The digits are A=4, B=1, C=6, D=7, E=2, F=3. All are distinct: {4, 1, 6, 7, 2, 3}.\n    *   Check the prime pairs: AB=41 (prime), CD=67 (prime), EF=23 (prime). Yes.\n\n5.  **Final Answer:** All conditions are met. The number is ABCDEF = 416723.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.\nHe tells Rex, \"The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.\"\n\"Sounds like quite the house!\" remarked Rex.\n\"Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.\"\n\"So what's the square footage of my house?\" Ralph asked.\n\"Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?\" asked Rex.\n\"Yes of course,\" Ralph replied.  \"It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.\"\nRex smiles and says, \"Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.\"\nHow did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?\n Solution: 2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.

Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Hint": "A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.\nThe first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.

To find this, we first need to determine the shape (number of sides) of the house and property, which are identical regular polygons. The key information linking the unknown shape to the known dimensions is the length of the excavated pipe, which equals one side of the property and also bisects the area of the house. By setting up and solving an inequality based on the possible lengths of area-bisecting chords for a regular polygon relative to the property side length, the number of sides is found to be 10 (a decagon). Using the given fence length (400 feet for 9 sides), the dimensions of the property and house foundation are calculated. From these, the area of the decagonal house floor plan is found. The area of the central circular atrium is calculated based on its diameter being one-tenth of the property's longest dimension (the diameter of its circumscribing circle). The atrium area is subtracted from the house floor plan area, and the result is doubled for the two stories to get the final square footage.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core unknown:** The shape (number of sides, *n*) of the regular polygon house and property lot is unknown. This is needed to use the geometric relationships and the fence measurement.\n2.  **Relate Property and House Dimensions:** The property is a regular polygon circumscribing a circle with radius *R*. The house foundation is a concentric circle with radius *r*. The distance from the foundation edge to the property edge is equal to the foundation diameter (2*r*). This means the radius of the property's circumscribed circle *R* is *r* + 2*r* = 3*r*. The house is a regular polygon inscribed within the foundation circle (radius *r*).\n3.  **Use the Pipe Information:** An old pipe bisected the *area* of the house polygon, with its ends on the house edge. The *length* of this pipe is equal to the length of one *side* of the property polygon (*s_property*).\n4.  **Establish Bounds on Pipe Length:** For a regular *n*-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius *r* (the house), the length of a chord that bisects its area must be between a minimum (Min(*n*)) and maximum (Max(*n*)) value. These depend on *n* and *r*.\n5.  **Express Property Side Length:** The side length of the property polygon (*s_property*) can be expressed in terms of the radius of its *inscribed* circle (which is *R* = 3*r*) and the number of sides *n*. Using trigonometry, *s_property* = 2 * (3*r*) * Tan(Pi/*n*) = 6*r* * Tan(Pi/*n*).\n6.  **Formulate and Solve Inequality for *n*:** Since the pipe length equals *s_property*, we have: Min(*n*) \u2264 6*r* * Tan(Pi/*n*) \u2264 Max(*n*). We can simplify by setting the house radius *r* = 1. The bounds Min(*n*) and Max(*n*) can also be expressed relative to *r*=1 (e.g., using 2*r* and 2*a* for even *n*, where *a* is apothem). Solving this inequality for integer *n* yields *n* = 10. The house and property are decagons.\n7.  **Calculate Property Side Length:** The fence covers *n*-1 = 9 sides and is 400 feet long. Therefore, the length of one side of the property (and the pipe) is *s_property* = 400 / 9 feet.\n8.  **Calculate Property and Foundation Radii:** Using *s_property* = 400/9 feet and *n*=10 in the formula *s_property* = 6*r* * Tan(Pi/10), solve for the foundation radius *r*. Then find the radius of the property's circumscribing circle *R_prop_circum* (needed for atrium calculation) using the property's apothem (3*r*) and *n*=10: *R_prop_circum* = (3*r*) / Cos(Pi/10).\n9.  **Calculate House Area:** Calculate the area of the decagonal house (*A_house*) inscribed in the foundation circle of radius *r*. The area is *A_house* = 10 * (1/2 * base * height) = 10 * (1/2 * *s_house* * *a_house*), where *s_house* and *a_house* are the side length and apothem of the house decagon, calculated using *r* and *n*=10. (Alternatively, use *A* = (n/2)*r^2*Sin(2Pi/n)).\n10. **Calculate Atrium Area:** The longest measurement of the property is the diameter of its circumscribing circle (2 * *R_prop_circum*). The atrium diameter is (1/10) of this, so the atrium radius is *r_atrium* = *R_prop_circum* / 10. Calculate the area of the circular atrium *A_atrium* = Pi * (*r_atrium*)^2.\n11. **Calculate Final Square Footage:** The area of each floor, excluding the atrium, is (*A_house* - *A_atrium*).

This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.", "Model": "GeminiPro", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "Okay, here is a summary and step-by-step reasoning for the provided solution.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe solution derives formulas for the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius, `x`) and the circumscribed circle (circumradius, `R`) of a general triangle. For the inradius, it relates the triangle's area (`A`) to its semiperimeter (`s`) and the inradius (`x`) by dividing the triangle into three smaller triangles using the incenter. This yields `A = sx`, leading to `x = A/s`. By substituting Heron's formula for the area (`A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`), the inradius is expressed purely in terms of side lengths: `x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s)`. The solution then states the standard formula for the circumradius: `R = abc / 4A`.\n\n**Reasoning Steps:**\n\n**Finding the Inradius (x):**\n\n1.  **Define variables:** Let the triangle have side lengths `a`, `b`, `c`. Define the semiperimeter `s = (a + b + c) / 2`. Let `A` be the area of the triangle, and `x` be the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius).\n2.  **Geometric Decomposition:** Imagine drawing line segments from the center of the inscribed circle (the incenter) to each of the three vertices. This divides the main triangle into three smaller triangles.\n3.  **Calculate Areas of Smaller Triangles:** Each of these smaller triangles has one side of the original triangle as its base (`a`, `b`, or `c`). The height of each smaller triangle, measured from the incenter perpendicular to the side, is equal to the inradius `x`. Therefore, their areas are `(a * x) / 2`, `(b * x) / 2`, and `(c * x) / 2`.\n4.  **Relate Total Area to Smaller Areas:** The area `A` of the original triangle is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles: `A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2`.\n5.  **Factor and Substitute Semiperimeter:** Factor out `x/2` from the expression: `A = (a + b + c) * x / 2`. Recognize that `(a + b + c) / 2` is the semiperimeter `s`. Thus, `A = s * x`.\n6.  **Solve for Inradius (First Formula):** Rearrange the equation from Step 5 to find the inradius in terms of area and semiperimeter: `x = A / s`.\n7.  **Introduce Heron's Formula:** State Heron's formula, which calculates the area `A` using only the side lengths: `A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`.\n8.  **Substitute Area (Second Formula):** Substitute the expression for `A` from Heron's formula (Step 7) into the formula for `x` (Step 6): `x = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) / s`.\n9.  **Simplify:** Bring `s` inside the square root (as `s^2` in the denominator) and simplify: `x = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) / s^2) = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c) / s)`. This gives the inradius purely in terms of side lengths.\n\n**Finding the Circumradius (R):**\n\n1.  **State the Formula:** The solution directly states the standard formula for the radius of the circumscribed circle (circumradius, `R`) without derivation: `R = abc / 4A`. (Here `a, b, c` are the side lengths and `A` is the area of the triangle).", "Status": true}
{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.\n\"The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.\"\n\"OK,\" says Ralph after a moment.  \"That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?\"\n\"No, no, no,\" replies Rex.  \"I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.\"\n\"The digital sum of each of the number's prime factors is prime, as is digital sum of the product of these sums.  In fact, if you the reverse the digits in the product's digital sum you get a different prime number that is the digital sum of the number I'm thinking of.\"\nRalph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.\n\"The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.\"\n\"What number am I thinking of?\" asks Rex.\nRalph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, \"OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.\"\nRex frowns and says, \"One of those numbers is divisible by 13.\"\nRalph smiles and tells Rex the number.\nWhat were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?\nNote: The \"digital sum\" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.\n Solution: The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Hint": "You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.\nThe problem is as much about logic as it is about math.", "Human Solution": "The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.
