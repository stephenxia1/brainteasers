0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Below is one systematic way to obtain the three path–counts (and therefore the three wedding dates) together with the length of the longest lawful route.  A picture of a regular hexagon with every pair of vertices joined (the complete graph K₆) is extremely helpful while reading.

--------------------------------------------------
1.  The geometry and the “rules’’
--------------------------------------------------
•  The six villages are the six vertices of a regular hexagon, call them
        A, B, C, D, E, F   (labelled clockwise).

•  A straight jungle‐path joins every pair of villages, so we have the 15 edges of K₆.  
  These edges meet in 13 interior crossings:  
        – one central crossing M where the three lines of symmetry AC, BD, EF meet;  
        – on every line joining opposite villages (for instance AC) there is one
          extra crossing (Ai on AM, Ci on CM, etc.);  
        – on every line that joins two non-adjacent coastal villages
          (for instance AB–CF) there is one extra crossing (ABi, BCi, …).  

  Altogether the vertices in our graph are  
        A, B, C, D, E, F, M, Ai, Bi, Ci, Di, Ei, Fi, ABi, BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi, FAi.

•  Orient every edge so that it points from the village that is farther from a chosen
  destination to the one that is nearer; by doing so we obtain a directed
  acyclic graph (DAG).  A suitor may walk only along the arrows.  

•  If N(x) is the number of directed paths that start from the suitor’s home
  village S and finish at a vertex x, then
        N(S)=1
  and whenever all predecessors of a vertex x already have their values,
        N(x)=Σ N(predecessors of x).
  Evaluating the vertices in order of decreasing distance from the destination
  therefore supplies N(destination), i.e. the required path–count.

--------------------------------------------------
2.  Suitor 1 – courting the immediately clockwise village (A → B)
--------------------------------------------------
Order of evaluation (“furthest first’’):
        A (=1)  →  Ai (=1)  →  ABi (=1+1=2)  →  Bi (=2)  →  B (=1+2+2=5).

So there are 5 admissible routes from A to B.  
The fifth and last fish is delivered on 5 April, so the wedding is

        6 April.

--------------------------------------------------
3.  Suitor 2 – courting the second village clockwise (A → C)
--------------------------------------------------
A convenient evaluation order is

A(1) → AFi(1) → Fi(1) → Ai(2) → ABi(3) →  
M(3), B(4)  →  Bi(10), Di(3)  →  
BCi(14), CDi(3)  →  Ci(20)  →  C(41).

Thus N(C)=41.  
The 41 st fish is delivered on 11 May, so the wedding is

        12 May.

--------------------------------------------------
4.  Suitor 3 – courting the diametrically opposite village (A → D)
--------------------------------------------------
Because the picture is left-right symmetric about AD we can do the left side
and copy the numbers to the right:

A(1) → B, F(1) → ABi, FAi(2) →  
Ai(5) → Fi, Bi(3) → EFi, BCi(4) →  
M(11), C, E(5) → Ci, Ei(20) →  
CDi, DEi(25) → Di(61) → D(121).

Hence N(D)=121.  
The 121 st fish is delivered on 31 July, so the wedding is

        1 August.

--------------------------------------------------
Summary of wedding dates
        first couple   →  6 April  
        second couple  → 12 May  
        third couple   →  1 August

--------------------------------------------------
5.  Bonus – the longest legal route and its length
--------------------------------------------------
The longest admissible path is one of the two symmetric seven-edge walks

   A–B–ABi–C–Ci–CDi–Di–D     or     A–F–FAi–E–Ei–DEi–Di–D.

Its length can be read from the geometry of the inscribed hexagon.

Let the circumference of the island be 10 mi.  
Then radius r = 5/π miles and every side of the hexagon also measures r.  
Break the walk into pieces of known length:

• Along the perimeter:    A–B  (length r)  
• Along half-edges that lie on the three main symmetry lines (each ½r) :  
        C–Ci and Di–D (together r).  
  Those three pieces already give one complete diameter, 2r = 10/π miles.

• The four remaining pieces (B–ABi, ABi–BCi, BCi–C, Ci–CDi) are sides or half-sides
  of the equilateral triangles that fill the hexagon.  Each of those sides
  equals r/√3, so together they contribute   4·r/√3 = 20/(√3 π) miles.

Hence

        longest distance = 10/π  +  20/(√3 π)
                         ≈ 3.183 mi + 3.675 mi
                         ≈ 6.86 miles.

The longest single journey any suitor makes is about 6.86 miles.",
1,"What is the smallest integer such that if you rotate the number to the left you get a number that is exactly one and a half times the original number?
(To rotate the number left, take the first digit off the front and append it to the end of the number.  2591 rotated to the left is 5912.)","The number has 16 digits.  I repeat, the number has 16 digits.","1,176,470,588,235,294

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:
1176470588235294
2352941176470588
3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Write the unknown number as  

N = d₁·10^{k-1} + R                         (1)  

k  : number of digits (k ≥ 2)  
d₁ : first (left-most) digit (1 ≤ d₁ ≤ 9)  
R  : remainder of the digits (0 ≤ R < 10^{k-1})

After a one–place left rotation the number becomes  

M = R·10 + d₁.                              (2)

The condition is that the rotated number is one–and-a-half times the original number:

R·10 + d₁ = 3/2 ( d₁·10^{k-1} + R ).       (3)

Clear the fraction and collect R–terms:

20R + 2d₁ = 3d₁·10^{k-1} + 3R  
17R       = d₁ ( 3·10^{k-1} – 2 ).          (4)

Because 17 is prime and d₁ < 17, 17 must divide the bracket.  
So we need a power of 10 for which

3·10^{k-1} ≡ 2 (mod 17).                    (5)

Working modulo 17 (10 is a primitive root, order 16)

10^{0}=1, 10^{1}=10, 10^{2}=15, 10^{3}=14, 10^{4}=4, 10^{5}=6,  
10^{6}=9, 10^{7}=5, 10^{8}=16, 10^{9}=7, 10^{10}=2, 10^{11}=3,  
10^{12}=13, 10^{13}=11, 10^{14}=8, 10^{15}=12, 10^{16}=1 …

At the exponent n = 15 we obtain 3·10^{15} ≡ 2 (mod 17).  
Thus k – 1 = 15 and the number must have

k = 16  digits.

Now compute

S = ( 3·10^{15} – 2 ) / 17 = 176 470 588 235 294.          (6)

From (4):  R = d₁·S.

Since R must still be only 15 digits long we require

d₁·S < 10^{15}  ⇒  d₁ ≤ 5.

Hence every choice d₁ = 1,2,3,4,5 gives a valid 16-digit solution

N = d₁·(10^{15} + S) = d₁·1 176 470 588 235 294.          (7)

Explicitly

d₁ = 1 : 1 176 470 588 235 294  
d₁ = 2 : 2 352 941 176 470 588  
d₁ = 3 : 3 529 411 764 705 882  
d₁ = 4 : 4 705 882 352 941 176  
d₁ = 5 : 5 882 352 941 176 470  

For each of these numbers the left rotation equals 1.5 × N, e.g.

1 176 470 588 235 294  →  1 764 705 882 352 941 = 1.5 × N.

Therefore the smallest such integer is

Start with a 12-digit decimal number

For every divisor d of 12 (d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) split the 12 digits into consecutive blocks of length d, read every block as a (base-10) integer and add the blocks.

(See the hint for an explanation of the terminology.)","The digital sum is the sum of the digits in the number. The digital sum of 247 is 2+4+7 = 13.
The digit pairs in 125690 are 12 56 90. These are also the numbers formed by the digit pairs.
Rotating 123456 one to the left gives 234561;
Rotating 123456 one to the right gives 612345;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the left gives 789056;
Rotating the digit pairs in 567890 to the right gives 905678.","416723
Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Rex told Ralph that the only possible number is  

416 723  

and here is one systematic way to see why it is the single solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Translate the conditions into algebra
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Write the unknown six–digit number as  

A B C D E F . (All six digits are different.)

1.  “The digital sum matches the number formed by the last two digits.”  
 A+B+C+D+E+F = 10 E + F . … (i)

2.  “The sum of the first two digits is the same as the sum of the last two digits.”  
 A + B = E + F . … (ii)

3.  Let S be the sum of the six numbers Ralph makes Rex add:

 ABCDEF  
 BCDEFA  
 FABCDE  
 DEFABC  
 CDEFAB  
 EFABCD  

   In every column of this long addition the six addends are the six
   digits A,B,C,D,E,F in some order, so every column–total is the same
   number A+B+C+D+E+F.
   Hence, apart from the carries, the six columns all look like

  AAAAAA  
 + BBBBBB  where A+B =digit-sum = 10E+F .

   Working the carries through shows that
   • the right-hand (units) digit of S is F,  
   • the far left-hand digit of S is either E or E+1,
   and these two extreme digits of S must be E and F “in some order”.
   This is only possible when the carry never reaches 10, i.e.

 E + F < 10. … (iii)

4.  Each “digit pair” is prime: AB, CD, EF are all primes.  Each is
   therefore odd (except 2), so every digit A,B,C,D,E,F is odd except
   possibly the single digit 2.  That means there can be at most one
   even digit and that even digit, if present, must be 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Find the possible digit–sums
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The digital sum (10E + F) lies between
1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21 and 4+5+6+7+8+9 = 39,
so the only primes in that range that also satisfy (iii) (E+F<10) are

17 , 23     (19,29,31,37 are excluded because 1+9,2+9,3+1,3+7 ≥ 10).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Rule out 17
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If the sum were 17 then E F = 17, i.e. E=1,F=7 or E=7,F=1.
Condition (ii) then says A+B = 8.  The unused digits would have to be
0,2,3,4,5,6,8,9, and the only way to pick two different digits that add
to 8 while leaving four different digits that add to 17-8 = 9 is
impossible, and moreover the pair CD left behind could not both be odd
primes.  So 17 does not work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Therefore the digit–sum is 23
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Now E F = 2 3 (or 3 2) and A+B = 5 (from (ii)).

There are only two unordered ways to make 5 from two different digits:  
0+5 or 1+4.  
0 cannot start a six–digit number and 05 is not prime, so A B = 41.

Digits used so far: 4 1 2 3 .
The remaining two different digits must add to 23 − (4+1) − (2+3) = 13
and must form a two-digit prime.  The only unused pair that does this is

6 + 7 = 13 → C D = 67 (prime).

Thus the number is 4 1 6 7 2 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Check every condition
-------------------------------------------------------------------
• All digits different – yes.  
• Digital sum 4+1+6+7+2+3 = 23 = EF – yes.  
• A+B = 4+1 = 5, E+F = 2+3 = 5 – yes.  
• Pairs 41, 67, 23 are all prime – yes.  
• E+F = 5 < 10, so the extreme digits of the grand sum are 2 and 3;
  indeed the six numbers add to 2 555 553 whose first/last digits are 2,3 – yes.

Everything is satisfied, so Ralph’s number is uniquely

416 723.",
6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Let  

 n = number of sides of both polygons  
 r = radius of the circular foundation (circum-radius of the house)  
 aₕ = apothem of the house = r cos(π/n)  
 Aₚ = apothem of the property  

1.  How far is the property from the foundation?  
   “The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is the same as the diameter of the foundation”, i.e.  

         Aₚ – r = 2r ⇒ Aₚ = 3r.                                             (1)

2.  Side of the property.  
   For a regular n-gon the side is  

         sₚ = 2Aₚ tan(π/n)=6r tan(π/n).                                      (2)

3.  The pipe.  
   Any straight line through the centre of a regular n-gon bisects its area.  
   The shortest such bisector is the distance between the mid-points of two opposite sides: 2aₕ = 2r cos(π/n).  
   The longest is a diameter of the circum-circle: 2r.  

         2r cos(π/n) ≤ L ≤ 2r,                                               (3)

   where L is the length of the pipe.

4.  The pipe equals one side of the property (it became the gate), so

         L = sₚ = 6r tan(π/n).                                               (4)

   Putting (4) into (3) and dividing by 2r gives

         cos(π/n) ≤ 3 tan(π/n) ≤ 1.                                          (5)

   The right-hand inequality tan(π/n) ≤ 1/3 gives π/n ≤ arctan(1/3) ≈ 0.32175 ⇒ n ≥ 10.  
   Test n = 10:

        3 tan(π/10)=3(0.32492)=0.97476 and cos(π/10)=0.95106,

        0.95106 ≤ 0.97476 ≤ 1 ✓

   For n = 11 the left part fails, so the only possible value is

         n = 10 : the house (and the lot) is a regular decagon.              (6)

5.  Lengths.  
   The fence encloses the other nine sides, so

         9sₚ = 400 ⇒ sₚ = 400/9 = 44.444… ft                                (7)

   From (2) with n = 10:

         r = sₚ /[6 tan(π/10)] ≈ 22.80 ft.                                   (8)

6.  Area of one floor of the decagonal house.  
   Area of a regular n-gon with circum-radius r is ½ n r² sin(2π/n):

         A₁ = ½·10·r²·sin(36°) ≈ 1526 ft².                                  (9)

7.  The atrium.  
   The “longest measurement of the property” is the diameter of the property’s circum-circle: 2Rₚ, where  

         Rₚ = Aₚ /cos(π/10) = 3r /cos(π/10) ≈ 71.9 ft.

   The atrium diameter is one-tenth of that, so its radius is Rₚ/10 ≈ 7.19 ft, giving  

         A_atrium = π(Rₚ/10)² ≈ 163 ft².                                     (10)

   Usable floor area per storey:

         A_floor = A₁ – A_atrium ≈ 1526 – 163 = 1363 ft².                    (11)

8.  Two storeys:

         Total house area ≈ 2 × 1363 = 2726 ft² ≈ 2.73 × 10³ ft².            (12)

8,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other. Frustrated that Ralph was able to so easily figure out his last question, Rex is certain this one won't be so easy.  He tells Ralph he's thinking of a number.
""The numbers one less and one more than the number are both the product of five prime numbers.  The three numbers together have thirteen prime factors, all different.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 1400.""
""OK,"" says Ralph after a moment.  ""That's probably enough information to find the number with a brute-force search, is that what you expect me to do?""
""No, no, no,"" replies Rex.  ""I don't want you to do anything as inelegant as that.  Here's some more information.""

Ralph takes out a pad of paper and starts jotting down some notes.
""The middle two digits in the number are its only prime digits and the number formed by the middle two digits is also prime.  The number formed by the first three digits in the number is prime and its digital sum is also prime.  In fact, the digital sum of the digital sum, and the digital sum of the digital sum of the digital sum of the first three numbers are also both prime.""
""What number am I thinking of?"" asks Rex.
Ralph jots down a few more notes and then does a couple of calculations on his calculator.  He says, ""OK, I know it's one of two numbers, but I don't want to factor these to figure out which one.""
Rex frowns and says, ""One of those numbers is divisible by 13.""
Ralph smiles and tells Rex the number.
What were the two numbers and which one was the one Rex was thinking of?
Note: The ""digital sum"" is the sum of the digits in a number.  For example, the digital sum of 247 = 2 + 4 + 7 = 13.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"The only two integers that satisfy every one of Rex’s clues are  

  443 794 and 887 314  

and, because Rex added the last remark ‘one of those numbers is divisible by 13’, Ralph could immediately discard 443 794 ( = 13 × 34 138 ).  
Hence the number Rex had in mind was  

  887 314.",
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.
Sachin : Oh, now I also know the numbers.
Nakul : Now I also know the numbers.
How did they know the numbers?",,"The numbers are 4 and 13.
As Sachin is initially confident that they (i.e. he and Prashant) don't know the numbers, we can conclude that -
1) The sum must not be expressible as sum of two primes, otherwise Sachin could not have been sure in advance that Prashant did not know the numbers.
2) The product cannot be less than 12, otherwise there would only be one choice and Prashant would have figured that out also.
Such possible sum are - 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77, 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97, 101, 107, 113, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 131, 135, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 155, 157, 161, 163, 167, 171, 173, 177, 179, 185, 187, 189, 191, 197, ....
Let's examine them one by one.
If the sum of two numbers is 11, Sachin will think that the numbers would be (2,9), (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6).
Sachin : ""As 11 is not expressible as sum of two primes, Prashant can't know the numbers.""
Here, the product would be 18(2*9), 24(3*8 ), 28(4*7) or 30(5*6). In all the cases except for product 30, Prashant would know the numbers.
- if product of two numbers is 18:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 18, the sum could be either 11(2,9) or 9(3,6). But if the sum was 9, Sachin would have deduced that I might know the numbers as (2,7) is the possible prime numbers pair. Hence, the numbers must be 2 and 9."" (OR in other words, 9 is not in the Possible Sum List).
- if product of two numbers is 24:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 24, the sum could be either 14(2,12), 11(3,8 ) or 10(4,6). But 14 and 10 are not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 3 and 8.""
- if product of two numbers is 28:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 28, the sum could be either 16(2,14) or 11(4,7). But 16 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be 4 and 7.""
- if product of two numbers is 30:
Prashant : ""Since the product is 30, the sum could be either 17(2,15), 13(3,10) or 11(5,6). But 13 is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the numbers must be either (2,15) or (5,6)."" Here, Prashant won't be sure of the numbers.
Hence, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is either 18, 24 or 28.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be either (3,8 ), (4,7) or (5,6)."" But he won't be sure. Hence, the sum is not 11.

Here, Prashant will be sure of the numbers if the product is 52.
Sachin : ""Since Prashant knows the numbers, they must be (4,13).""
For all other numbers in the Possible Sum List, Prashant might be sure of the numbers, but Sachin won't.
Here is the step by step explanation:
Sachin : ""As the sum is 17, two numbers can be either (2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12), (6,11), (7,10) or (8,9). Also, as none of them is a prime numbers pair, Prashant won't be knowing numbers either.""
Prashant : ""Since Sachin is sure that both of us don't know the numbers, the sum must be one of the Possible Sum List. Further, as the product is 52, two numbers can be either (2,26) or (4,13). But if they were (2,26), Sachin would not have been sure in advance that I don't know the numbers as 28 (2+26) is not in the Possible Sum List. Hence, the two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Sachin : ""As Prashant now knows both the numbers, out of all possible products - 30(2,15), 42(3,14), 52(4,13), 60(5,12), 66(6,11), 70(7,10), 72(8,9) - there is one product for which list of all possible sum contains ONLY ONE sum from the Possible Sum List. And also, no such two lists exist. [see table above for 17] Hence, two numbers are 4 and 13.""
Nakul figured out both the numbers just as we did by observing the conversation between Sachin and Prashant.
It is interesting to note that there are no other such two numbers. We checked all the possible sums till 500!!!",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Call the two integers x (< y) and let  

  S = x + y  (the sum whispered to Sachin)  
  P = x · y  (the product whispered to Prashant)

The four public remarks give four successive pieces of information that every
listener can use.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Sachin :  “Prashant, I don’t think that we know the numbers.”
-------------------------------------------------
Sachin knows the value S.  
His sentence means that, whatever the two addends that give this S may be,  
Prashant could not possibly know the numbers immediately from their product.

Prashant would be able to know the numbers at once only when the product is
uniquely factorisable into two integers larger than 1, i.e. when the product
is of the form p q with p and q primes ( a “semiprime” ).

Hence S cannot contain even one decomposition into two primes, otherwise
Sachin could not be sure that Prashant was ignorant.  
So

  S is NOT expressible as the sum of two primes.             (1)

(Among the positive integers the first such sums are
11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, …).  
All other sums are ruled out at once.

Let L₁ denote this list of “non-prime” sums.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Prashant :  “Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”
-------------------------------------------------
Prashant knows P.  
After Sachin’s remark he can discard every factor pair whose sum is
not in L₁.  
He can announce the numbers only when exactly one of the factor pairs that
produce P has its sum in L₁.

So P has the property

  Among all factor pairs (a,b) of P with a,b > 1
  exactly one pair gives a sum that lies in L₁.             (2)

List of the smallest products with this property

  18 = 2·9       (sums 11, 9 → only 11 in L₁)  
  24 = 3·8       (sums 11,14,10 → only 11 in L₁)  
  28 = 4·7       (sums 11,16     → only 11 in L₁)  
  52 = 4·13      (sums 17,28     → only 17 in L₁)  
  76 = 4·19      (sums 23,40     → only 23 in L₁)  
  112 = 7·16     (sums 23,32,58 → only 23 in L₁)  
  …  

Call this set of products L₂.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Sachin :  “Oh, now I also know the numbers.”
-------------------------------------------------
Sachin still has the same S but he now knows that P lies in L₂.
He can identify the addends only when, for his particular S, exactly one of
its decompositions produces a product that lies in L₂.

Testing every S ∈ L₁ we get

•  S = 11  →  decompositions give the products 18, 24, 28, 30  
             (three of them are in L₂)  →  Sachin would still be unsure.

•  S = 17  →  decompositions give the products  
             30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72  
             Only 52 is in L₂  →  Sachin can now identify the pair (4,13).

•  Every other S in L₁ leaves at least two admissible products in L₂,
   so Sachin would remain uncertain.

Therefore

  S = 17  and  {x,y} = {4,13}   (the only possibility).       (3)

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Nakul :  “Now I also know the numbers.”
-------------------------------------------------
Nakul has heard only the public conversation, but he can repeat the same
reasoning without knowing either S or P:

•  From Sachin’s first sentence he builds the list L₁.  
•  From Prashant’s sentence he builds the list L₂.  
•  From Sachin’s second sentence he looks for sums in L₁ that are produced by
   exactly one product in L₂.  

There is exactly one such sum, S = 17, and the unique pair that realises it
is (4,13).  Hence Nakul can also announce the numbers.

-------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
-------------------------------------------------
The only pair of integers that satisfies all four public statements is

     the numbers are 4 and 13.",
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Call the original number of coconuts N.  
After each nocturnal visit let Ti be the number of coconuts that is left in the pile (T0 = N, T1 after the first thief, … , T5 on the following morning).

Every visit follows exactly the same pattern:

• one coconut is thrown to the monkey, so Ti-1 − 1 is divisible by 5;  
• the visitor removes one fifth of what is left; four fifths are put back.

Hence, for every i = 1 … 5  

            Ti = 4/5 · (Ti-1 − 1) .  (1)

and the morning pile T5 must itself be divisible by 5 (the survivors share it without remainder).

----------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Express T5 in terms of N
----------------------------------------------------------------
Apply (1) five times:

T1 = (4/5)(T0 − 1)  
T2 = (4/5)(T1 − 1) = (4/5)²(T0 − 1) − (4/5)  
T3 = (4/5)³(T0 − 1) − (4/5)² − (4/5)  
T4 = (4/5)⁴(T0 − 1) − (4/5)³ − (4/5)² − (4/5)  
T5 = (4/5)⁵(T0 − 1) − (4/5)[1 + (4/5) + (4/5)² + (4/5)³].

The bracket is the sum of a geometric series:

1 + (4/5) + (4/5)² + (4/5)³ = (1 − (4/5)⁴)/(1 − 4/5) = 369/125.

Insert this value and the powers 4⁵ = 1024, 5⁵ = 3125:

           T5 = 1024/3125 (N − 1) − 1476/625.          (2)

----------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Impose the “no remainder in the morning” condition
----------------------------------------------------------------
Write T5 = 5k for some integer k.  Multiply (2) by 3125:

3125·T5 = 15625k = 1024N − 8404.                         (3)

So N must satisfy the congruence

           1024 N ≡ 8404  (mod 15625).                  (4)

----------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Solve the congruence
----------------------------------------------------------------
Because 1024 ( = 2¹⁰) and 15625 ( = 5⁶) are coprime, 1024 has a modular inverse.  
Using the extended Euclidean algorithm one finds

           1024 · 10849 ≡ 1  (mod 15625).

Multiply (4) by 10849:

           N ≡ 8404 · 10849 ≡ 3121  (mod 15625).

----------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The least positive solution
----------------------------------------------------------------
The smallest positive integer satisfying the congruence is therefore

           N = 3121.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Answer

When the back of the train reaches Al

14,"This puzzle is split into an initial logic based piece and then a rigorous math piece, so everyone can play.
Picture a standard clock with continuously moving hour and minute hands.
A ""Swap Time"" is a time when you can swap the hour and minute hand, and still get a valid time.
For example, 3:00 is NOT a Swap Time. If we swap the minute hand and the hour hand, then the minute hand points directly at the 3 and the hour hand points directly at the 12. This is not a valid time. When the minute hand points at the three, the hour hand will not be pointing directly at any number.
A) Find one Swap Time.
B) What are the Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00?
Times will be specified as hours, minutes, and seconds rounded to two decimal places.
Ignore a.m. and p.m. distinctions.
Bonus: How many Swap Times are there in total?",,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
To find all Swap Times between 1:00 and 2:00, set i = 1 and check all values of j.
j = 0, s = 25.17482517, time = 1:00:25.17

Swap Time occur every 12 * 3600 / 143 = 302.0979 seconds.
There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Solution outline  
(1)  Translate the positions of the two hands into angles.  
(2)  Write down what is meant by a “valid time”.  
(3)  Impose the extra requirement that exchanging the two hands is still a valid time.  
(4)  Solve the resulting simultaneous equations.

Angles of the hands  
Minute hand :  M = 6 m  (m = minutes, counted continuously, so 12.5 min means M = 75°)  
Hour   hand :  H = 30 h + 0.5 m  (h = 0,1,…,11 is the integer hour that has begun)

What does “hand–swap” mean?  
If we interchange the two hands, the new minute angle must again be 6 m′ and the
new hour angle 30 h′ + 0.5 m′ for some integer h′.

After the swap  
m′ = H / 6 = 5 h + m/12                        (1)  
6 m    = 30 h′ + 0.5 m′                        (2)

Insert (1) into (2):

6 m = 30 h′ + 0.5(5 h + m/12)  
6 m − m/24 = 30 h′ + 2.5 h  
(143/24) m = 30 h′ + 2.5 h

Multiply by 24:

143 m = 720 h′ + 60 h
143 m = 60(12 h′ + h)                         (3)

Let k = 12 h′ + h.  
Because h and h′ can each be 0,1,…,11, the integer k can take every value
k = 0,1,2,…,143.

Equation (3) now gives the minute value directly:

m = 60 k / 143                                (4)

For a given k
 h     = k mod 12  
 h′    = ⌊k/12⌋

Every k from 0 to 142 therefore produces a distinct “Swap Time” inside a
twelve-hour cycle.  There are 143 of them in all.

A)  One example  
Take k = 1.  
 h = 1, m = 60/143 = 0.41958… min = 25.1748 s  
Time = 1 : 00 : 25.17 (about twenty-five seconds past one) – a Swap Time.

B)  All Swap Times between 1 :00 and 2 :00  
Between 1 and 2 o’clock we need h = 1, i.e. k ≡ 1 (mod 12):

k   m (min)           Time (rounded to 0.01 s)  
 1   60/143     1:00:25.17  
13  780/143     1:05:27.27  
25 1500/143     1:10:29.37  
37 2220/143     1:15:31.47  
49 2940/143     1:20:33.57  
61 3660/143     1:25:35.66  
73 4380/143     1:30:37.76  
85 5100/143     1:35:39.86  
97 5820/143     1:40:41.96  
109 6540/143    1:45:44.06  
121 7260/143    1:50:46.15  
133 7980/143    1:55:48.25

So there are twelve Swap Times in the 1 o’clock hour.

Bonus – how many in all?  
Because k runs from 0 to 142 inclusive, a twelve-hour period contains

143 Swap Times,

one of them being the doubly-coincident 12:00 exactly.  
They are equally spaced by

15,"I was talking to a friend Tammy, the middle child of five.  She has a younger sister Tracey, and three brothers Tommy (oldest child), Timmy and Tony (youngest child).  I asked her how old she was, but she hardly ever gives a straight answer.  The following is the conversation we had.
""How old are you Tammy?""
""I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.  Actually, it's funny, but Timmy's, Tracey's, Tommy's and my ages were all factors of Mum's age when Tony was born.  The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.""
""How old is your Mum now?""
""There's another funny thing.  When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.""
Assuming Tammy was talking in terms of whole years, and with my mathematical and reasoning abilities I was able to quickly deduce not just Tammy's age, but all of their ages.  So how old are Tommy, Timmy, Tammy, Tracey, Tony and Mum now?",,"Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.
Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"The only set of whole-year ages that satisfies every sentence Tammy said is  

Tommy = 23, Timmy = 19, Tammy = 18, Tracey = 16, Tony = 13, Mum = 43.

Why these and no others?

1.  Let  

    Mₜ  = Mum’s age when she had Tommy  
    M₀  = Mum’s age when she had Tony  
    T₀  = Tommy’s age when Tony was born.  

    From Tammy’s last remark  
        “When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy”,  

        Tony’s age when Mum is 50  = 50 − M₀  
        must equal Mₜ.  

        Therefore Mₜ + M₀ = 50                    (1)

    And because Tony was born T₀ years after Tommy,  
        M₀ = Mₜ + T₀ ⇒ T₀ = M₀ − Mₜ.  

    Substituting (1): T₀ = 50 − 2Mₜ              (2)

2.  The four elder children’s ages when Tony was born – T₀, Timmy’s Tim₀, Tammy’s Tam₀, Tracey’s Tra₀ – were all factors of M₀, so M₀ must have at least four different factors larger than 1.

    The sum relation (1) forces M₀ to be between 26 and 49.  Among those numbers only  
        30, 36, 40, 42, 44, 45 and 48  
    have four or more proper factors.

3.  T₀ must itself be a factor of M₀ (because T₀ is one of the four children) and is given by (2).  
    Checking each candidate M₀ quickly shows that the only one for which (2) also gives a factor of M₀ is

        M₀ = 30 ⇒ Mₜ = 20 ⇒ T₀ = 10.

4.  The remaining proper factors of 30 are 6, 5 and 3, so at Tony’s birth

        Tim₀, Tam₀, Tra₀ = 6, 5, 3 in some order,                 (3)

    and Tammy’s present-age condition

        Tam_now = 3 × Tim₀                                   (4)

    lets us pair them uniquely:

        Tim₀ = 6, Tam₀ = 5, Tra₀ = 3.

5.  Hence the age gaps are fixed:

        Tommy 10 yr older than Tony,  
        Timmy  6 yr older than Tony,  
        Tammy  5 yr older than Tony,  
        Tracey 3 yr older than Tony,  
        Mum    30 yr older than Tony.

6.  Let Tony’s present age be x.  Then everybody is

        Tony   x  
        Tracey x+3  
        Tammy  x+5  
        Timmy  x+6  
        Tommy  x+10  
        Mum    x+30.

7.  The only other time when three or more children’s ages were factors of Mum’s age occurred when Tracey was half of Tammy’s present age.  Tammy is now (x+5); half of that is (x+5)/2, which must be Tracey’s age (x+3) some years ago:

        x + 3 − k = (x + 5)/2 for some integer k ≥ 0

        ⇒ k = x − 4.       So the moment was x−4 years ago.

        Then Mum’s age then was (x+30) − (x−4) = 34.  
        But 34 has only two non-trivial factors (2 and 17), so the requirement cannot be met unless x−4 = 7, i.e. x = 13, which makes Mum 36 at that moment.  Since 36 has plenty of factors (6, 9 and 12 among them), the condition is satisfied and no other value of x works.

8.  Therefore

        Tony   13  
        Tracey 16  
        Tammy  18  
        Timmy  19  
        Tommy  23  
        Mum    43.

All of Tammy’s statements are now true, and no other whole-number ages meet them, so these must be their present ages.",
16,"The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
""That's the last one married off - thank goodness!   That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for.  Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise.  They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme?  No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress.  Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters.   You don't see that every day, I bet.  But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?""
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages.  How old are they?","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Your set of ages works perfectly.

According to Sue's statement, let A be the first digit of Sue's wealth, B be the remaining digits, and n be the number of digits, then Y=A*10^(n-1)+B and X=10B+A.

Sue’s extra clue

“Remove my first digit and tack it onto the end; the result is Sandy’s amount.”

Write Sue’s n-digit number as Y = A·10^{n-1} + B,
where A (1–9) is the leading digit and B is the remaining n–1 digits (0 ≤ B < 10^{n-1}).

The digit-rotation described gives Sandy’s number:

   X = 10B + A.                                              …(4)

Use (3):  X = 5k , Y = 7k.

Substitute k = X/5 into Y = 7k and compare with the digit condition:

   7X = 5Y  
   7(10B + A) = 5(A·10^{n-1} + B)                (using (4))

   (5·10^{n-1} − 7) A = 65B.                               …(5)

Because the left side is not divisible by 5, the only way the right side can be is for A itself to supply the factor 5.  Hence

   A = 5.                                                   …(6)

Put A = 5 into (5):

   5·10^{n-1} − 7 = 13B  
   B = (5·10^{n-1} − 7) / 13.                               …(7)

We need an integer B with n ≤ 6 (they have less than a million dollars).  
Check n = 2,3,4,5,6 for divisibility by 13.  The first (and only, before a million) success is

   n = 6 : 5·10^{5} − 7 = 499 993 = 13 × 38 461  
   ⇒ B = 38 461.

——————————————————————————  
Compute the actual amounts

k = 2B + A/5 = 2·38 461 + 1 = 76 923.

Sandy:  X = 5k = 5 × 76 923 = 384 615 dollars.  
Sue:    Y = 7k = 7 × 76 923 = 538 461 dollars.

A quick check:
• Sue gives 76 923 → both have 461 538.  
• Sandy gives 76 923 → Sandy 307 692, Sue 615 384 (twice Sandy).  
• Moving Sue’s leading 5 to the rear of 538 461 indeed gives 384 615.

   The smallest positive m that satisfies this is m = 10.

3.  Compute n

Any other solution differs from 25201 by a multiple of lcm(2520,11)=27720, so 25201 is the minimal positive integer that meets all the conditions.

The number pairs that are prime in both directions are:  11/11, 13/31, 17/71, 37/73, and 79/97 (19 is eliminated since its reverse, 91, is not prime).

Because condition 4 demands that the two–digit blocks obtained in the
reversed number are prime as well, we may use only those primes whose
reverse is again prime.  
Those “reversible” primes are

11 , 13/31 , 17/71 , 37/73 , 79/97.  (19 is ruled out, because 91 is not prime.)

Step 1 – what can stand next to 9 ?  
In the reversible list a 9 occurs only in 79 and 97, therefore every 9 has
to be adjacent to a 7.  Since there are two 9’s and exactly two 7’s, the
pair 9-7 appears once as 97 and once as 79 in the 8-digit string.

So the sought number has the shape  

97 ■ ■ ■ ■ 79  ,  97 97 ■ ■      or   ■ ■ 79 79 .  

(The four empty places are to be filled with the two 1’s and the two 3’s.)

Step 2 – what can stand next to 7 ?  
The reversible pairs that start with 7 are 71 and 73, those that end with 7
are 17 and 37.  That means that directly after a 7 we may put 1 or 3, and
directly in front of a 7 we may again put 1 or 3.  Consequently all four
blank positions must be filled only with 1’s and 3’s.

Step 3 – the four middle digits.  
Inside that four–digit block every consecutive 2-digit number has to be
11, 13 or 31 (33 is not prime).  With the multiset {1,1,3,3} only three
arrangements satisfy this:

1313 , 3131 , 3113.

In this system of Quocorrian math, you change the operation to its opposite (+ to -, * to / and vice versa), and solve regularly. Then, you subtract three from that answer. Finally, you square that to get your answer.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Correct—81 is the Quocorrian answer.

Recap of the rule you’ve discovered  
1. Replace the given operator with its “opposite”:  
   + ↔ –  * ↔ /  
2. Evaluate in ordinary arithmetic.  
3. Subtract 3 from that result.  
4. Square the final value.

Check on the examples
• 2 + 2 → 2 – 2 = 0 → 0 – 3 = –3 → (–3)² = 9  
• 4 * 1 → 4 / 1 = 4 → 4 – 3 = 1 → 1² = 1  
• 5 – 2 → 5 + 2 = 7 → 7 – 3 = 4 → 4² = 16  
• –3 + 2 → –3 – 2 = –5 → –5 – 3 = –8 → (–8)² = 64  

Applying it to 6 / 2  
6 / 2 → 6 * 2 = 12  
12 – 3 = 9  
9² = 81

So 6 ÷ 2 in Quocorrian math equals 81.",

26,"A four digit number (not beginning with 0) can be represented by ABCD. There is one number such that ABCD=A^B*C^D, where A^B means A raised to the B power. Can you find it?",,The only number is 2592. 2^5 is 32 and 9^2 is 81. 32*81 is 2592.,GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Well done—2592 is indeed the unique solution.  
Here’s a concise demonstration of why no other four-digit number ABCD can satisfy ABCD = A^B · C^D.

1. Size bounds  
   • The largest digit is 9, so the biggest possible product of two one-digit powers is 9^9 · 9^9 = 9^18 ≈ 1.50 × 10^17, which is far too large.  
   • On the small side, 1^1 · 1^1 = 1. So we just need four-digit products (1000–9999).

2. Restricting the bases  
   • If either base (A or C) is 0, the product is 0.  
   • If a base is 1, its power is 1, leaving the other power to supply the entire four-digit number (impossible, because one-digit bases raised to one-digit exponents never reach four digits).  
   So A, C ∈ {2,…,9}.

3. Rough magnitude check  
   • 2^9 = 512, 3^9 = 19683 (> 9999). So the only way to keep the product in the four-digit range is to keep exponents modest when the base is ≥ 3.  
   • Trying all feasible pairs (A,B) and (C,D) whose powers remain ≤ 9999 gives a short list:

     2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 32, 2^6 = 64, 2^7 = 128, 2^8 = 256, 2^9 = 512  
     3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729  
     4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 4^3 = 64, 4^4 = 256  
     5^1 = 5, 5^2 = 25, 5^3 = 125  
     6^1 = 6, 6^2 = 36  
     7^1 = 7, 7^2 = 49  
     8^1 = 8, 8^2 = 64  
     9^1 = 9, 9^2 = 81

4. Exhaustive check  
   Compute every product of two numbers from the list and look for four-digit results whose decimal digits match the selected bases and exponents. Only one match appears:

   2^5 = 32  
   9^2 = 81  
   32 × 81 = 2592 ⇒ A = 2, B = 5, C = 9, D = 2

5. Verification  
   2592 is a four-digit number, begins with 2 (non-zero), and satisfies the required equality, so it works.

Since the search is exhaustive and no other combination satisfies the digit-matching condition, 2592 is the unique solution.",
27,"Can you find the largest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits, considering 0 also a number, that is divisible by 11 without a remainder?
(Note: each number may appear only one time.)",,"987652413, is the highest number possible containing any of 9 of 10 digits and is divisible by 11 without a remainder.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Yes – 987 652 413 is the biggest possible 9-digit number that  

• uses each digit at most once (choosing nine of 0 … 9),  
• has no leading 0, and  
• is divisible by 11.

Why it is the maximum

1. To make the number as large as possible we obviously keep the eight highest digits 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and decide which one of the remaining two digits (1 or 0) we will leave out.  
   Omitting 0 gives the better chance of a larger value, so the digit set we must arrange is  
   {9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}.

2. Divisibility rule for 11 (for a 9-digit number x₁x₂…x₉)  
      x₁ – x₂ + x₃ – x₄ + x₅ – x₆ + x₇ – x₈ + x₉ ≡ 0 (mod 11).

   Fix the first five digits at the largest possible values in descending order:

          9 – 8 + 7 – 6 + 5 = 7.            (1)

   So after the first five places the alternating sum is 7.  
   Call the remaining four digits that we still have to place

          a  b  c  d   (to be put in positions 6,7,8,9)
          –  +  –  +

   The contribution of those four places to the alternating sum is

          (-a + b – c + d) = (b + d) – (a + c).          (2)

   Adding (1) and (2) we need

          7 + (b + d) – (a + c) ≡ 0 (mod 11).           (3)

3. Look for the lexicographically largest choice.  
   Start by trying the biggest remaining digit in the 6th position (a).

   • a = 4 ⇒ equation (3) would need (b + d) – (4 + c) ≡ 4 or –7, which is impossible with the tiny digits left.  
   • a = 3 gives the same impossibility.  
   • a = 2 works:

        put a = 2,  c = 1.  Then (a + c) = 3.

        To satisfy (3) we need (b + d) = 7

        …and the only way with the unused digits is b = 4, d = 3.

   Arranging b and d so that the earlier position gets the larger digit gives

          a  b  c  d  =  2  4  1  3.

4. The full number is therefore

          987652413.

   Any attempt to use a larger digit than 2 in the 6th place fails the 11-rule, and with a = 2 the ordering b = 4, d = 3 is already the lexicographically largest. Hence no larger 9-digit, once-each-digit number exists that is divisible by 11.

5. Quick check:

      9 – 8 + 7 – 6 + 5 – 2 + 4 – 1 + 3 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11). ✔  
      Therefore 987 652 413 ÷ 11 = 89 786 583 with no remainder.

So 987 652 413 is indeed the greatest possible such number.",
28,"After being intrigued by Quocorria's mathematical systems, you decide to extend your stay on this mathematically advanced planet.

The professor gives you a piece of paper with four true math problems on it. Like before, you must discover the system.

Here are the problems:
2+2=12
5-3=62

In this system, you multiply each number by -1, changing it to its opposite. Then, do the operation normally. Then, add the two numbers together and square it. Add that to the original.
For all you equation people...
-a*-b+(a+b)^2
With the * being the indicated operation.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Correct – the result of 1 − 3 in this Quocorrian system is 18.  
Here is one concise way to see why the rule works and how it is applied.

1.  Negate both numbers:  a → –a ,  b → –b  
2.  Perform the indicated operation on those negated numbers.  
3.  Add the square of the ordinary (positive) sum, (a + b)².

Algebraically, for any two numbers a and b with operation ∘,

 Quocorrian result = [ (–a) ∘ (–b) ] + (a + b)².

Checking the four given examples:

• 2 + 2  
 (–2)+(–2)=–4  (a + b)² = 4² = 16  –4+16 = 12 ✓

• 5 − 3  
 (–5)–(–3)=–2  (a + b)² = 8² = 64  –2+64 = 62 ✓

• 3 × 4  
 (–3)×(–4)=12  (a + b)² = 7² = 49  12+49 = 61 ✓

• 6 / 3  
 (–6)/(–3)=2   (a + b)² = 9² = 81  2+81 = 83 ✓

Now apply the same rule to 1 − 3:

 (–1) – (–3) = –1 + 3 = 2  
 (a + b)² = (1+3)² = 4² = 16  
 Total = 2 + 16 = 18.

Therefore, in this system 1 − 3 equals 18.",
29,"Using only two 2's and any combination of mathematical signs, symbols and functions can you make 5?",,"SQRT(.2 ^ -2)

2. (1/5)^−2 = (5)^2 = 25
