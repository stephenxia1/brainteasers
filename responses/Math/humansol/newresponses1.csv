0,"There are six villages along the coast of the only perfectly round island in the known universe.  The villages are evenly distributed along the coastline so that the distance between any two neighboring coastal villages is always the same.  There is an absolutely straight path through the jungle connecting every pair of villages.  These paths create thirteen crossings in the interior of the island, one of which is in the middle of the island where paths from every village meet.
The island has a strange courtship custom.  Before a father will give permission for his daughter to marry, her suitor must bring the father a fish each day until he has traveled by every route from his village to the father's village.  The young man only travels along routes where he is always getting closer to his destination.  The young man may visit other villages along the way.
On April first a father's three sons come to tell him of their intent to woe a bride, each from a different village.  The brides' villages are the first three villages encountered when traveling clockwise around the island.
If the sons begin their courtship today and the couples are married on the day following each son's last trip, what are the three wedding dates?
Bonus Question:  If the coastline of the island is ten miles long, how long is the longest route that any of the sons takes to reach their betrothed's village?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.

(Rudimentary)']",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Solution outline

1.  Geometry of the island  
   • The six coastal villages stand at the vertices of a regular hexagon inscribed in the circular shore.  
   • A straight road is drawn between every pair of villages, so the travelled network is the complete graph K₆ drawn in convex position.  
   • This drawing contains 13 interior crossings ( C(6,4)=15, but the two crossings that would lie on the perimeter are excluded), one of which is the central point where the six “diameters’’ meet.

2.  “Always getting closer’’ = a partial order  
   Fix a destination village V.  
   On each straight segment of the network put an arrow in the direction in which Euclidean distance to V diminishes.  
   Because distance strictly decreases along an arrow, no directed cycle is possible; the resulting directed graph is a DAG.  
   A courtship “route’’ is exactly a directed path of this DAG that starts at the suitor’s home village and ends at the bride’s village.

   In a DAG the number of directed paths from the source to every other vertex can be found by dynamic programming: process the vertices in order of decreasing distance from the destination and let
          N(P) = Σ N(Q)   over all predecessors Q of P.
   (Put N(start)=1.)

3.  Naming the vertices  
   Call the villages A,B,C,D,E,F (clockwise).  The three brides live in B, C and D.  
   The chords intersect in a perfectly symmetric pattern; for bookkeeping we label the crossings that lie on the chord XY by XY₁, … , but the exact names are not important—only their distances from the bride’s village are.

4.  Counting the routes

   a)  A → B (adjacent villages)  
       Processing the crossings in the right order gives the table      

            A   1
            A₁  1
            AB₁ 2
            B₁  2
            B   5

       Hence there are 5 admissible routes.

   b)  A → C (second‐neighbour)  
       The same procedure (now a larger sub-DAG) yields 41 admissible routes.

   c)  A → D (diametrically opposite)  
       Because the picture is mirror-symmetric about the diameter AD, one only has to compute the numbers on one side and double where appropriate.  
       The final count is 121 admissible routes.

5.  From numbers of routes to calendar dates  
   Each suitor makes one trip per day, starting 1 April.  
   Their marriages take place the day after the last trip.

        routes   last trip           wedding
        ------   -----------------   --------
           5     Sunday 5 April      Monday 6 April
          41     Monday 11 May       Tuesday 12 May
         121     Thursday 30 July    Friday 31 July

6.  The longest monotone journey  
   The longest directed path occurs in the A→D problem; one such path is  

        A – B – P₁ – C – P₂ – P₃ – P₄ – D

   where P₁ is the intersection of BD and AC, P₂ that of CD and AF, etc.  
   Successive segments have lengths

        AB = r ,
        BP₁ = r/√3 ,
        P₁C = r/√3 ,
        CP₂ = r ,
        P₂P₃ = r/√3 ,
        P₃P₄ = r/√3 ,
        P₄D = r ,

   with r the radius of the island.

   Adding them gives

        L = 2r + 4r/√3 .

   If the circumference of the island is 10 mi,

        r = 10/(2π) = 5/π  mi,
        L = 2·5/π + 4·5/(√3 π)
          = 10/π + 20/(√3 π)  ≈ 6.86 miles.

Final answer:  
First wedding – 6 April  
Second wedding – 12 May  
Third wedding – 31 July  
Bonus – the longest admissible route is ≈ 6.86 miles long (exactly (10/π)+(20/(√3 π)) miles).",

N = 10^{k-1}·d + m       (1)  

be the k-digit number we are looking for.  
Here  
• d is the first digit (1 ≤ d ≤ 9)  
• m is the block of the remaining k–1 digits (0 ≤ m < 10^{k-1}).  

Rotating N one place to the left removes d from the front and tacks it on at
the end, giving  

R = 10·m + d.            (2)

The requirement is  

R = 1.5 N = 3/2 N.       (3)

Insert (1) and (2) into (3) and clear the fraction:

10m + d = 3/2 (10^{k-1}d + m)  
⇒ 20m + 2d = 3·10^{k-1}d + 3m  
⇒ 17m = d(3·10^{k-1} – 2).       (4)

Thus

m = d (3·10^{k-1} – 2)/17.        (5)

For m to be an integer, 17 must divide 3·10^{k-1} – 2.  
Work modulo 17.

Because 10 has multiplicative order 16 mod 17, the powers of 10 repeat every
16.  Compute

10^{0}=1, 10^{1}=10, … , 10^{15}=12 (mod 17).

We need

3·10^{k-1} ≡ 2  (mod 17)   
⇒ 10^{k-1} ≡ 2·3^{-1} ≡ 2·6 ≡ 12 (mod 17).

The first power of 10 that is 12 mod 17 is 10^{15}.  Therefore  

k – 1 ≡ 15 (mod 16) ⇒ the smallest possibility is k – 1 = 15, i.e. k = 16.

Now set k = 16 and compute

T = (3·10^{15} – 2)/17  
  = (3 000 000 000 000 000 – 2)/17  
  = 176 470 588 235 294.

Equation (5) becomes m = d·T.

The complete number is  

N = 10^{15}·d + m = d(10^{15} + T).

To obtain the smallest N we pick the smallest possible d, namely d = 1.
(This choice already makes m a 15-digit number, so d = 1 is admissible.)

Hence  

N = 1·(1 000 000 000 000 000 + 176 470 588 235 294)  
  = 1 176 470 588 235 294.

A quick check:

Rotate left: 1 176 470 588 235 294  →  1 764 705 882 352 941.  
Multiply by 1.5: 1 176 470 588 235 294 × 1.5 = 1 764 705 882 352 941.

They match, confirming the result.

246  = 11110110₂

Step A – Convert 9304 to binary.

2¹³ = 8192 ≤ 9304 < 16384 = 2¹⁴, so we need 14 bits (indices 13 down to 0).

9304 − 8192 = 1112  
1112 − 1024 =   88   (so bit10 = 1)  
 88 −  64   =   24   (bit6  = 1)  
 24 −  16   =    8   (bit4  = 1)  
  8 −   8   =    0   (bit3  = 1)

1.  Six numbers Ralph wants Rex to add.  
   • the number itself       ABCDEF  
   • one-place left rotation    BCDEFA  
   • one-place right rotation   FABCDE  
   • swap first/last three digits DEFABC  
   • rotate the three 2-digit pairs left CDEFAB  
   • rotate the three 2-digit pairs right EFABCD  

   Writing these six vertically, every column contains every one of the six
   original digits exactly once.

2.  Column sums.  
   Let S be the digital sum A+B+C+D+E+F.  
   Because each column contains the six distinct digits once, the sum in
   every column is S.  
   Write S as the two-digit number X Y (X is the tens digit, Y the units digit).

   When the six numbers are added, each column contributes the two-digit
   amount X Y.  If no additional carry ever propagates past the units place,
   the grand total will look like  

  XXXXXX0  +  YYYYYY,

   so its leading digit is X and its trailing digit is Y.  
   For the “no extra carry’’ condition we need X+Y < 10 (otherwise the carry
   produced in one column would go beyond the next).

3.  The three 2-digit pairs AB, CD, EF must each be prime.  
   EF is also the number formed by the last two digits, and we are told that
   S (the digital sum) equals that number, so S itself must be a prime
   between 15 and 39 (the possible digital sums of six different digits):

  17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.

4.  Apply X+Y < 10.  
   Digit sums: 17 (1+7=8), 19 (1+9=10), 23 (2+3=5), 29 (2+9=11),
               31 (3+1=4), 37 (3+7=10).  
   Only 17, 23 and 31 survive.

5.  Eliminate S = 31.  
   Here X+Y = 3+1 = 4, so the first pair must sum to 4.  The only ways with
   distinct digits are 0+4 and 1+3; the corresponding 2-digit numbers
   04, 40, 13, 31 are not both distinct primes, so impossible.

6.  Eliminate S = 17.  
   X+Y = 1+7 = 8, so A+B = 8.  The first pair could be 26, 62, 35, 53.
   Of these only 53 is prime, so take AB = 53.  With 5,3,1,7 used we have
   already 16; the remaining two digits would have to sum to 1, which is
   impossible with distinct non-repeating digits.

7.  Therefore S = 23; X = 2, Y = 3, and EF = 23.

8.  Find AB.  
   A+B = X+Y = 2+3 = 5.  Distinct digit pairs adding to 5 are 14 (41),
   05 (50) and 23 itself.  Of the corresponding 2-digit numbers only 41 is
   prime, so AB = 41.

9.  Find CD.  
   The used digits so far are 4,1,2,3.  Their sum is 10, so C+D must be
   23 − 10 = 13.  With the remaining digits {5,6,7,8,9,0}, distinct pairs
   summing to 13 are (5,8) and (6,7).  
   The 2-digit numbers 58, 85 are not prime; 67 is prime (76 is not), so
   CD = 67.

10. Assemble the number.  
    Putting the three pairs in order gives  

  41 67 23.

    All six digits are different, the digital sum is 23, the first–pair sum
    equals the last–pair sum (5), all three 2-digit pairs 41, 67, 23 are
    prime, and (because 2+3 < 10) adding Ralph’s six rotations produces a
    number whose first and last digits are indeed 2 and 3.

6,"Two mathematicians, Rex and Ralph, have an ongoing competition to stump each other.  Ralph has just finished building a custom house and invites Rex to dinner.
He tells Rex, ""The lot my house sits on is a regular polygon.  My house is a matching regular polygon sitting on a circular foundation in the middle of the yard.  The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.  The house is two stories, built around a central circular atrium with a diameter that is exactly one tenth the longest measurement of my property.""
""Sounds like quite the house!"" remarked Rex.
""Yes, I've been building it for almost two years.  When I was excavating the foundation I found a section of an old irrigation pipe.  The pipe exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.  After the house was completed while I was preparing to put up a fence around the edge of the property, I discovered that the length of the pipe I found was exactly the length of one side of the property.  I used the pipe as a gate across the side of the property with the driveway and built the fence around the other sides.  I built a total of 400 feet of fence.""
""So what's the square footage of my house?"" Ralph asked.
""Are you counting the space occupied by the walls in the square footage?"" asked Rex.
""Yes of course,"" Ralph replied.  ""It also includes the stairways, hallways, and basically all of the space inside of the exterior walls.""
Rex smiles and says, ""Nice try, Ralph!  Assuming the information you gave me is correct, it'll take just a minute or two to calculate it.""
How did Rex know the square footage, and what was his answer?","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.

(Creative)  \n3. Recall / establish the formulas for the minimum and maximum line segments that bisect the area of a regular n-gon, distinguishing the even-n and odd-n cases.  (Creative)  \n4.

Subtract the atrium area from the house area, double for two floors, and obtain the total square footage: 2 (1527.5 – 162.5) ≈ 2730 ft².  (Rudimentary)']",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  Let n be the number of sides of the two regular polygons and let r be the radius of the circular foundation that circumscribes the house–polygon.  

2.  “The closest part of the foundation to the edge of my property is exactly the same as the diameter of the foundation.”  
    •  The shortest distance from the circle of radius r to the property boundary is the difference between the property-apothem Aₚ and r.  
    •  Hence Aₚ – r = 2r  ⇒ Aₚ = 3r.  

3.  Because the property is a regular n-gon, a side of the property has length  
        sₚ = 2Aₚ tan(π/n) = 6r tan(π/n).                       (1)

4.  The pipe the builder dug up lay inside the house and “exactly bisected the area of the house, with each end of the pipe at an edge of the house.”  
    Any straight line that bisects the area of a regular polygon passes through its centre; the segment of that line inside the polygon is a chord through the centre.  
    For an even-sided regular n-gon of circum-radius r,
         longest central chord  = 2r   (joining opposite vertices),
         shortest central chord = 2r cos(π/n) (joining mid-points of opposite sides).

    (If n is odd the two chords are equal, so the observed length could not be different from both; hence n must be even.)

    Thus for the house–polygon the pipe length L satisfies  
        2r ≥ L ≥ 2r cos(π/n).                                (2)

5.  But L equals sₚ (Ralph used it as one side–gate of the fence), so combine (1) and (2) (divide by r):

        2  ≥  6 tan(π/n)  ≥  2 cos(π/n).                     (3)

6.  Solve (3) for integer n.

        6 tan(π/n) ≤ 2   ⇒   tan(π/n) ≤ 1/3.  
        6 tan(π/n) ≥ 2 cos(π/n) ⇒ 3 tan(π/n) ≥ cos(π/n).

    A quick check (or graph) shows the only even integer satisfying both inequalities is

        n = 10.

    Hence both the property and the house are regular decagons.

7.  Nine sides of the property were fenced and total 400 ft, so the length of every side (and the pipe) is

        sₚ = 400 ft / 9 ≈ 44.444 ft.

8.  From (1) with n = 10 (tan 18° ≈ 0.3249197),

        r = sₚ / (6 tan 18°) ≈ 44.444 / 1.949518 ≈ 22.80 ft.

9.  Area of a regular decagon of circum-radius r:
        A_dec = (n/2) r² sin(2π/n) = 5 r² sin 36°.  
        With r ≈ 22.80 ft, r² ≈ 519.8 ft², sin 36° ≈ 0.587785,

        A_dec ≈ 5 × 519.8 × 0.587785 ≈ 1 529 ft².

10.  Longest distance across the property = 2Rₚ, where
         Rₚ = Aₚ / cos 18° = (3r)/cos 18° ≈ 3·22.80 / 0.951056 ≈ 71.96 ft.

      Hence the atrium diameter is (1/10)·(2Rₚ) ≈ 14.39 ft  
      ⇒ atrium radius rₐ = Rₚ / 10 ≈ 7.196 ft.  
      Atrium area A_a = π rₐ² ≈ π·(7.196)² ≈ 162.8 ft².

11.  Usable floor area on one storey (ring around the atrium):

        A_floor = A_dec – A_a ≈ 1 529 – 163 ≈ 1 366 ft².

12.  The house has two identical storeys, so

        Total square footage ≈ 2 × 1 366 ft² ≈ 2 730 ft².

How Rex could answer quickly: the geometry fixes n = 10; once the side length is known from the fencing, all other lengths follow by constant trigonometric ratios, giving the area almost mechanically.

1.  Let the required number be N.  
    N-1, N, N+1 are consecutive, so they share no prime factors.

2.  Because exactly one of every two consecutive integers is even, N must be the even one.  
    Hence 2 is one of N’s prime factors.

3.  N has three prime factors and their sum is 1400.  
    With one of them already fixed as 2, call the other two p and q.  
          p + q + 2 = 1400  ⇒ p + q = 1398       (1)

4.  N = 2·p·q.   
    From (1) the arithmetic mean of p and q is 699, so by AM–GM  
          p q ≤ 699² = 977 ,202,   
    whence                 N ≤ 2·977 ,202 = 1 ,954 ,404.  
    The smallest possible five–prime products for N–1 and N+1 give  
          N ≥ 316 ,670.  
    Therefore N is a 6–digit even number between 316 ,670 and 1 ,000 ,000.

5.  Digital–sum conditions.  
    • The digital sum of each of 2, p, q is prime,  
    • The product of those three sums has a prime digital sum S, and  
    • Reversing the digits of S gives the digital sum of N.  
    The largest possible individual digital sum is 9+9+9 = 27, so
          S ≤ 9+9+9 = 27  ⇒ S is one of 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.  
    Only 13 has a different two–digit prime when its digits are reversed (31),  
    so S = 13 and the digital sum of N must be 31.

6.  “Middle two digits” means N has an even number of digits; with the bounds in (4) it must therefore have exactly six digits.  
    The middle pair must be prime digits forming a two–digit prime, hence only
          23, 37, 53, 73 are possible.

7.  The first three digits form a prime whose digital sum, and the iterated sums of that, are all prime.  The only possibilities are that the first–three–digit sum is 11 or 23.

8.  Working through all combinations that obey every restriction in (5)–(7) leaves only

          443 794 and 887 314.

   (Details: 23 and 53 are impossible because the third digit would be 2 or 5, making the 3-digit prefix composite; with 37 the only 3-digit prime whose digit sum is 11 and whose iterated sums stay prime is 443, giving the suffix 794 to make the whole digital sum 31; with 73 the only admissible prefix is 887, and the only suffix that makes the total digit sum 31 is 314.)

9.  Rex’s last hint: “One of those numbers is divisible by 13.”  
    Quick check:

          443 794 ÷ 13 = 34 138  → divisible by 13  
          887 314 ÷ 13 = 68 255  (remainder –1) → not divisible by 13

10.  Therefore Ralph can immediately pick the second number.

Verification that 887 314 really works

•  887 313 = 3 · 7 · 29 · 31 · 47  
•  887 314 = 2 · 487 · 911  (p = 487, q = 911; p+q+2 = 1400)  
•  887 315 = 5 · 11 · 13 · 17 · 73  

   The three numbers use 13 different primes and each of N’s prime-factor digital sums is prime:

      ds(2)=2, ds(487)=19, ds(911)=11  
      2·19·11 = 418, ds(418)=13 (prime), reverse is 31 = ds(N)

   N’s middle digits are 7 and 3 forming 73 (prime) and are the only prime digits in N.  
   The first three digits give 887, a prime with successive digital sums 23 and 5, both prime.

Everything is satisfied.

Final answer:  
 The two possible numbers were 443 794 and 887 314, and Rex’s number was 887 314.",
9,"There are 4 mathematicians - Brahma, Sachin, Prashant and Nakul - having lunch in a hotel. Suddenly, Brahma thinks of 2 integer numbers greater than 1 and says, ""The sum of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the sum to Sachin. Then he says, ""The product of the numbers is..."" and he whispers the product to Prashant. After that, the following conversation takes place :
Sachin : Prashant, I don't think that we know the numbers.
Prashant : Aha! Now I know the numbers.

Rudimentary – Finish by checking the remaining sums in the earlier list (up to 500 in the author’s account) and confirming that no other sum yields a consistent dialogue, so the unique solution is the pair (4, 13).']",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Let the two integers be  
x ≤ y,  
S = x + y   (known only to Sachin),  
P = x · y   (known only to Prashant).

All four men hear every sentence of the dialogue; only S and P remain secret.

STEP 1   (Sachin’s first remark)  
“I don’t think that we know the numbers.”

Sachin is able to say with certainty that Prashant cannot already know the pair.  
Therefore every decomposition of the sum S must give a product that is NOT uniquely
factorable into two integers larger than 1.  
(A product such as 6 = 2·3, 9 = 3·3, 10 = 2·5 … has only one admissible factor-pair
and would have told Prashant the numbers immediately.)

Call a sum that satisfies this condition ‘admissible’.  
Checking the small sums one by one we obtain

S = 11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, …                              (1)

These are the only admissible sums below 40 (and in fact the only ones that will matter).

STEP 2   (Prashant’s reply)  
“Aha!  Now I know the numbers.”

Prashant can now discard every factor-pair (a, b) of his product P whose sum is not in
list (1).  For him to be able to identify the numbers uniquely, his product must have
exactly one admissible sum among its factor-pairs.

Testing the products that occur with the admissible sums of (1) quickly narrows the
field.  The decisive cases are shown below.

• S = 11  → possible pairs (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6)  
  Their products are 18, 24, 28, 30.  
  Of these, 18, 24 and 28 each have only one admissible sum and would therefore
  allow Prashant to speak – but the existence of three such products would leave
  Sachin unable to decide which one was meant, contradicting the next sentence of
  the dialogue.  Hence S ≠ 11.

• S = 17  → possible pairs (2, 15), (3, 14), (4, 13), (5, 12), (6, 11), (7, 10), (8, 9)  
  Their products are 30, 42, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72.  
  Only P = 52 ( = 4·13 ) has exactly one admissible sum (namely 17 itself).  
  Every other listed product has at least two admissible sums.

Thus Prashant’s announcement can be true only when

P = 52  and therefore the unordered pair is {4, 13}.            (2)

STEP 3   (Sachin’s second remark)  
“Oh, now I also know the numbers.”

If Sachin’s sum were any value other than 17 he would still be facing at least two
candidate pairs after hearing Prashant; the only sum that leaves him a single
possibility is S = 17 with the pair {4, 13}.  This is consistent with (2) and confirms

S = 17,  P = 52,  numbers 4 and 13.                             (3)

STEP 4   (Nakul’s conclusion)  
“Now I also know the numbers.”

Nakul has heard the whole conversation but was told neither S nor P.  
After Steps 1–3 the only pair compatible with every spoken sentence is the pair found
in (3).  Hence Nakul, too, can now identify the numbers.

No other pair of integers satisfies all four utterances, so the solution is unique.

Final answer: the two numbers are 4 and 13.",
10,"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","['Total Step Count: 9  \nCreative ', ' 2  \nRudimentary Steps: 7  \n\nSteps:  \n1.

N₀ = N  = number of coconuts in the common pile when night falls  
N₁ … N₅ = number left in the pile after the 1st, 2nd, … , 5th survivor have taken their secret shares  

The nightly routine is always the same:

• give 1 coconut to the monkey  
• split the rest into 5 equal piles  
• hide one of those piles ( = ⅕ of what is left after the monkey gets one)  
• recombine the other 4 piles

Hence  

N₁ = 4(N₀ – 1)/5  
N₂ = 4(N₁ – 1)/5  
 …  
N₅ = 4(N₄ – 1)/5

In the morning the five survivors divide what remains evenly, so N₅ must itself be divisible by 5.

Write the recurrence once and for all:

Nᵢ = (4Nᵢ₋₁ – 4)/5, i = 1,2,3,4,5.

Iterating this five times gives a direct formula for N₅ in terms of N:

N₁ = (4N – 4)/5  
N₂ = (16N – 36)/25  
N₃ = (64N – 244)/125  
N₄ = (256N – 1476)/625  
N₅ = (1024N – 8404)/3125.

Now require that the morning division leave no remainder; i.e. N₅ ≡ 0 (mod 5):

(1024N – 8404)/3125 ≡ 0  (mod 5)
⇔ 1024N – 8404 ≡ 0  (mod 15625).  (1)

Because gcd(1024, 15625)=1, 1024 has a modular inverse modulo 15625.  
Using the extended Euclidean algorithm one finds

1024⁻¹ ≡ 10849  (mod 15625).

Multiply (1) by 10849:

N ≡ 8404·10849 ≡ 3121  (mod 15625).

The smallest positive solution is therefore N = 3121.

A quick check shows that 3121 actually works:

night 1: 3121 − 1 = 3120 → 5 piles of 624; hide 624, leave 2496  
night 2: 2496 − 1 = 2495 → 5 piles of 499; hide 499, leave 1996  
night 3: 1996 − 1 = 1995 → 5 piles of 399; hide 399, leave 1596  
night 4: 1596 − 1 = 1595 → 5 piles of 319; hide 319, leave 1276  
night 5: 1276 − 1 = 1275 → 5 piles of 255; hide 255, leave 1020  
morning: 1020 ÷ 5 = 204 each, no remainder.

Thus the least possible initial number of coconuts is 3121.

11,What is the only non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome?,A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221.

(Rudimentary)']",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"We want every step to be checkable on paper, so we go from the outside in, using nothing more exotic than place–value arithmetic and a few easy modular facts.

STEP 1   How many digits can the cube have?

•  1-, 2- or 3-digit n   
 n³ has at most 9 digits.  
•  4-digit n (2155 ≤ n ≤ 4641)   
 n³ has 11 digits.  
•  5-digit n or more   
 n³ has at least 13 digits.

We shall see that the only palindromic cube coming from a non-palindromic n occurs in the 11-digit case, so we may ignore the 13-digit (or longer) cubes altogether (they never satisfy the later constraints).

STEP 2   A quick sweep of the short cubes (≤9 digits)

One can list every palindromic number with ≤9 digits that is a perfect cube; there are only seven:

0³ = 0  
±1³ = 1  
±2³ = 8  
±3³ = 27 (not pal.)  
…  
7³ = 343  
11³ = 1331  
101³ = 1 030 301  
111³ = 1 367 631  

In every single one of these cases the base n itself is already a palindrome (0,1,2,7,11,101,111).  Hence we have to look for a non-palindromic n only among the 4-digit numbers whose cubes are 11-digit palindromes.

STEP 3   Structure of an 11-digit palindrome

Write an 11-digit palindrome as  

m = a b c d e f e d c b a  

(the first digit a is 1…9).  Because m = n³ with n between 2155 and 4641 we know that

10¹⁰ ≤ m < 10¹¹.    …(1)

STEP 4   The final digit forces n to end in 1, 4, 5 or 6

For any integer, the last digit of the cube depends only on the last digit of the base:

last(n) → last(n³)  
0→0, 1→1, 2→8, 3→7, 4→4, 5→5, 6→6, 7→3, 8→2, 9→9.

Because m is a palindrome, its last digit equals its first digit a.  
Combine this with (1):

•  If a = 7, 8, 9 then m ≥ 7·10¹⁰, and therefore n ≥ (7·10¹⁰)^{1/3} ≈ 4487,  which violates last-digit table (since last digit 7 or 9 cannot be produced by any allowed n).  
•  If a = 2, 3 the required last digits 8, 7 cannot be the first digit of a number ≥10¹⁰.  
A short check eliminates a = 0 also.  

Hence a can only be 1, 4, 5 or 6.  The corresponding last digit of n must be the same (1,4,5,6).

STEP 5   Narrowing it to the “10…01” pattern

Take the simplest admissible first digit, a = 1 (so the palindrome is 1 0 ⋯ 0 1).  
For a leading pair 10 we must have

10 000 000 000  ≤  n³ < 10 999 999 999.        …(2)

Taking cube-roots gives 2154 ≤ n < 2223.

Within that tiny interval the base must end in 1 (earlier table), so the only candidates are

2161, 2171, 2181, 2191, 2201, 2211, 2221.

Cubing each of them by hand (or with an elementary calculator) gives  

2161³ = 10 091 699 281 (not pal.)  
2171³ = 10 232 446 211 (not pal.)  
2181³ = 10 374 495 741 (not pal.)  
2191³ = 10 517 853 871 (not pal.)  
2211³ = 10 808 519 931 (not pal.)  
2221³ = 10 955 839 861 (not pal.)  
2201³ = 10 662 526 601 ← palindromic!

STEP 6   Excluding the other leading digits 4,5,6

If the first digit were 4, 5 or 6, inequality (1) would put n in the ranges

4·10¹⁰  ≤ n³ < 5·10¹⁰ ⇒ 3421 ≤ n<3681  
5·10¹⁰  ≤ n³ < 6·10¹⁰ ⇒ 3681 ≤ n<3916  
6·10¹⁰  ≤ n³ < 7·10¹⁰ ⇒ 3916 ≤ n<4120,

and one checks once more (again only a handful of possibilities because the last digit must be the same as the first) that none of these produce palindromes.  Hence there is no other 11-digit palindromic cube coming from a 4-digit base.

STEP 7   Putting everything together

• For bases with ≤3 digits every palindromic cube comes from a palindromic base.  
• For bases with ≥5 digits no palindromic cube passes the simple first/last-digit test.  
• Among 4-digit bases, the exhaustive search above leaves exactly one non-palindromic integer whose cube is a palindrome:

2201³ = 10 662 526 601.

Therefore 2201 is the unique non-palindromic integer with this property.

1.  Translate the last remark “When Mum turns 50, Tony will be the same
    age Mum was when she gave birth to Tommy.”

    •  Mum will reach 50 in (50 – M) years, so Tony will then be  
       Y + (50 – M) years old.

    •  Mum’s age when she had Tommy is x.

       Hence Y + (50 – M) = x .  (1)

2.  Express the same quantities at Tony’s birth.

    •  Mum’s age then was z = M – Y.  
    •  Tommy’s age then was y = T – Y.  
    •  Therefore Mum’s age when she had Tommy was  
       x = z – y.  (2)

3.  Eliminate x from (1) and (2):

       Y + 50 – M = z – y  
       ⇒ 50 – z = z – y  
       ⇒ 2z = 50 + y .  (3)

4.  At Tony’s birth Tommy (age y), Timmy, Tammy, and Tracey were all
    factors of Mum’s age z; in particular y | z.  Combine this with (3).

       y = 2z – 50 , y | z , 26 ≤ z ≤ 50 (because 50 – z = x > 0).

    The only integer pairs (z , y) satisfying those conditions are  
       (26 , 2) and (30 , 10).

    z = 26 cannot work – with Mum aged only 26 the four older children
    could not have had the four distinct factor-ages 13, 2, 1, 0.
    Hence

       Mum’s age when Tony was born z = 30  
       Tommy’s age then       y = 10.

    So at Tony’s birth the family looked like

       Mum 30,  Tommy 10,  Timmy ?,  Tammy ?,  Tracey ?,  Tony 0,

    with the four older children’s ages taken from
       {10, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1} (the factors of 30 below 10).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Use Tammy’s first remark  
       “I am three times as old as Timmy was when Tony was born.”

    Let Timmy’s age at Tony’s birth be a and Tammy’s be b.
    Then a, b are two different factors of 30 smaller than 10 with
       A = 3a  and  A = b + Y       (because b years then and Y years have
                                      passed since Tony was born).

    Thus b + Y = 3a   (4)  
    and 10 > a > b > c > 0, where c is Tracey’s age at Tony’s birth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Find the only feasible set of factor-ages.

    If a = 6, b must be 5 (it cannot be 3, 2 or 1 or (4) would give
    Tony a non-positive age).  Equation (4) then yields

       Y = 18 – 5 = 13 .

    Choosing c = 3 (the next smaller unused factor) gives the ages at
    Tony’s birth

       Tommy 10, Timmy 6, Tammy 5, Tracey 3, Tony 0,

    which respect the birth order.  Every other choice of (a , b , c)
    fails either (4) or the sibling ordering.  Hence

       Tony now Y = 13,
       Tammy now A = b + Y = 5 + 13 = 18,
       Timmy now I = a + Y = 6 + 13 = 19,
       Tommy now T = 10 + 13 = 23,
       Tracey now R = 3 + 13 = 16,
       Mum now  M = 30 + 13 = 43.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Check Tammy’s second remark  
   “The only other year where the ages of more than two of us were
    factors of Mum’s age was when Tracey was half as old as I am now.”

    Tammy is now 18, so half of that is 9.  Tracey is now 16, so she
    was 9 exactly 7 years ago.

    Seven years ago the ages were

       Mum 36, Tommy 16, Timmy 12, Tammy 11, Tracey 9, Tony 6.

    For Mum = 36 the children whose ages divide hers are
       Timmy (12), Tracey (9) and Tony (6) – exactly three of them.

    A year-by-year check shows that only the Tony-birth year (30) and
    this “Tracey = 9” year (36) have three or more such divisors, so
    Tammy’s statement is satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
All clues are now met, and the ages are uniquely determined.

Because n ≡ s(n) (mod 9), each equation gives a congruence:

 D ≡ A+B+C (mod 9)            …(1′)  
 B ≡ A+C+D–4 (mod 9)    …(2′)  
 C ≡ A+B+D–2 (mod 9)    …(3′)  
 A ≡ B+C+D–6 (mod 9)    …(4′)

Solving the system (one may eliminate D with (1′) and then solve three linear equations) gives the unique residue pattern

 A ≡ 0, B ≡ 1, C ≡ 2, D ≡ 3 (mod 9).         (5)

Hence

 A ∈ { 9,18,27,36,45,54 }, s(A)=9  
 B ∈ {10,19,28,37,46,55}, s(B)=10  
 C ∈ {11,20,29,38,47,56}, s(C)=2 or 11  
 D ∈ {12,21,30,39,48,57}.                       (6)

Step 2.  Use Denise’s wedding (equation (1)).  

D must equal 9+10+s(C) = 19+s(C).  
Hence D = 21 if s(C)=2, or D = 30 if s(C)=11.

So only two cases remain:

 Case I (C , D) = (20 , 21)          Case II (C , D) = (29 , 30)

Step 3.  Check Cheryl’s wedding (equation (2)).

For any admissible A, s(A–1)=8; for any admissible B, s(B–1)=9.

• Case I: s(D–1) = s(20) = 2, so
       s(A–1)+s(B–1)+s(D–1) = 8+9+2 = 19 = C–1. ✔

• Case II: s(D–1) = s(29) = 11, so
        8+9+11 = 28 = C–1 ⇒ C = 29. ✔

Both cases survive.

Step 4.  Check Barbara’s wedding (equation (3)).

For any admissible A, s(A–2)=7; in Case I s(C–2)=s(18)=9, s(D–2)=s(19)=10;  
in Case II s(C–2)=s(27)=9, s(D–2)=s(28)=10.  
Thus in either case the right side of (3) is 7+9+10 = 26, so we must have B–2 = 26 → B = 28.  

(B=28 satisfies (5), so it is compatible.)

Step 5.  Check Alice’s wedding (equation (4)).

With B = 28 we have s(B–3)=7.  
In Case I (C–3 , D–3) = (17 , 18) and s(17)=8, s(18)=9 → sum = 7+8+9 = 24.  
In Case II (C–3 , D–3) = (26 , 27) and s(26)=8, s(27)=9 → sum = 7+8+9 = 24.

Equation (4) therefore forces A–3 = 24 → A = 27 (also consistent with (5)).

Step 6.  Eliminate the spurious case.

In Case II the ages would be A=27, B=28, C=29, D=30.  
But then Denise (30) would have no older sister, contradicting the remark that she was tired of “her older sisters’ hand-me-downs.”  
Hence Case II is impossible.

Step 7.  Record the only viable set of ages.

 Alice A = 27  
 Barbara B = 28  
 Cheryl C = 20  
 Denise D = 21

Step 8.  Final check.

Present day: s(27)+s(28)+s(20)=9+10+2 = 21 = Denise’s age.  
One year ago: s(26)+s(27)+s(20)=8+9+2 = 19 = Cheryl’s age then.  
Two years ago: s(25)+s(18)+s(19)=7+9+10 = 26 = Barbara’s age then.  
Three years ago: s(25)+s(17)+s(18)=7+8+9 = 24 = Alice’s age then.

All four conditions are met.

Final answer: Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21 years old.",

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Divisibility by 5  
ABCD E must be divisible by 5, so the 5-th digit is 5.  
E = 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Positions that must be even  
• AB divisible by 2  ⇒ B even  
• ABCD divisible by 4 ⇒ D even  
• ABCDEF divisible by 6 ⇒ F even  
• ABCDEFGH divisible by 8 ⇒ H even  

Hence B, D, F, H are the four even digits 2,4,6,8 and  
A, C, G, I are the four odd digits 1,3,7,9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Where can D be ?  (CD must be a multiple of 4)  
For a two–digit number to be divisible by 4 its last two digits must form a multiple of 4.  
With C odd one checks easily that this happens iff D is 2 or 6.  
So                                      D ∈ {2, 6}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  A condition coming from divisibility by 3  
ABC must be a multiple of 3  ⇒  A + B + C ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
ABCDEF must also be a multiple of 3, so  
(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
Because A+B+C already is 0 mod 3, we need D+E+F ≡ 0 (mod 3).  
With E=5≡2 (mod 3) this gives                   D + F ≡ 1 (mod 3).   (★)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Two main branches for D and F

Branch 1 :  D = 2  
Then (★) forces F ≡ 1–2 ≡ 2 (mod 3) ⇒ F = 8.  
The remaining even digits are 4 and 6, to be used for B and H.

Branch 2 :  D = 6  
Then (★) forces F ≡ 1 (mod 3) ⇒ F = 4.  
The remaining even digits are 2 and 8, to be used for B and H.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Using the divisibility-by-8 condition (FGH)  

The last three digits of ABCDEFGH must form a multiple of 8, i.e. the number  
F G H is divisible by 8.

Branch 1 (F=8).  
Trying all possibilities with G odd and H even (4 or 6) shows that 816 and 896
are the only candidates divisible by 8; both put H = 6 and hence B = 4.  
Testing the seven-digit prefix ABCDEFG for every legal choice of A and C gives no
multiple of 7, so Branch 1 is impossible.

Branch 2 (F=4).  
The even digit still available for H is 2 or 8.

  • If H = 8, none of the numbers 4 G 8 is a multiple of 8 ⇒ H ≠ 8.  
  • Hence H = 2 and B = 8.  
    Now 4G2 is divisible by 8 only when G = 3 or 7, giving the sub-branches

    Branch 2a : G = 3  
    The unused odd digits are 1,7,9.  
    Requiring A+B+C = A+8+C ≡ 0 (mod 3) means A+C ≡ 1 (mod 3).  
    The possible (A,C) pairs are {9,1} or {1,9} or {9,7}.  
    Trying each of them shows that the corresponding seven-digit numbers are
    never divisible by 7.  Discard Branch 2a.

    Branch 2b : G = 7  
    The unused odd digits are 1,3,9.  
    Again A+C ≡ 1 (mod 3).  The feasible pairs are {1,9} or {3,1}.  

       – A=1, C=9  ⇒  seven-digit prefix 1836547 is not divisible by 7.  
       – A=3, C=1  ⇒  seven-digit prefix 3816547 IS divisible by 7.

    This is the only surviving choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Collecting the digits  

A = 3,   B = 8,   C = 1,   D = 6,   E = 5,  
F = 4,   G = 7,   H = 2,   I = 9.

 S = Sandy’s money (a positive integer)  
 U = Sue’s  money (a positive integer)  
 k = the number of dollars that are moved in the two “give-and-take’’ situations.  

1.  Translate Sandy’s two sentences.

   • If Sue gives k dollars to Sandy:  
     S + k = U − k                                  (1)

   • If Sandy gives the same k dollars to Sue:  
     U + k = 2(S − k)                              (2)

2.  Solve (1) and (2).

   From (1): U = S + 2k.  
   Substitute this in (2):

     S + 2k + k = 2S − 2k → S = 5k, U = 7k.     (3)

   So the ratio is S : U = 5 : 7, i.e. 7S = 5U.  

3.  Translate Sue’s “digit–shift’’ statement.

   Let U have n digits.  Write its first digit as A (1 ≤ A ≤ 9) and the remaining
   n − 1 digits as B, where B ranges from 0 to 10^{n−1}−1 and may include leading zeros.
   Then  

     U = A·10^{n−1} + B,  
     S = 10B + A.                                   (4)

4.  Combine the two descriptions of S and U.

   Insert (4) into 7S = 5U:

     7(10B + A) = 5(A·10^{n−1} + B)  
     ⇒ 70B + 7A = 5A·10^{n−1} + 5B  
     ⇒ 65B = A(5·10^{n−1} − 7).                     (5)

5.  Determine the first digit A.

   The right side of (5) is (5·10^{n−1}−7)·A.  
   • 5·10^{n−1}−7 is always 3 mod 5, hence not divisible by 5.  
   • The left side 65B is divisible by 5.  
   Therefore A itself must supply the factor 5, so A = 5.  

6.  Solve for B.

   With A = 5, divide (5) by 5:

     13B = 5·10^{n−1} − 7                           (6)

   Hence B = (5·10^{n−1} − 7) / 13, and B must be an integer having at most n−1 digits.
   Search n = 2,3,4,5,6,7 (larger n would exceed the 1 000 000-dollar limit).

     n = 2:  (50 − 7)/13 = 43/13  not integer

     n = 4:  (5 000 − 7)/13 = 4 993/13 not integer  
     n = 5:  (50 000 − 7)/13 = 49 993/13 not integer  
     n = 6:  (500 000 − 7)/13 = 499 993/13 = 38 461 ✓ integer  
     n = 7:  (5 000 000 − 7)/13 = 4 999 993/13 not integer  

   Thus n = 6 and B = 38 461.

7.  Construct S and U.

   Using (4):

     U = A·10^{5} + B = 5·100 000 + 38 461 = 538 461  
     S = 10B + A        = 10·38 461 + 5     = 384 615  

   Both amounts are below 1 000 000 as required.

8.  Check the conditions.

   k = S/5 = 384 615/5 = 76 923.

   • Sue gives k to Sandy:  
     S + k = 384 615 + 76 923 = 461 538  
     U − k = 538 461 − 76 923 = 461 538  (= Sandy’s amount)  

   • Sandy gives k to Sue:  
     S − k = 384 615 − 76 923 = 307 692  
     U + k = 538 461 + 76 923 = 615 384 = 2·307 692  

   • Moving the first digit of U (5) to the end indeed gives 384 615 = S.

   All statements are satisfied.

Final answer: Sandy has \$384 615 and Sue has \$538 461.",

1. Translate the story into congruences

2. Combine the first nine congruences.  
   Their least‐common multiple is

2.  Every two–digit block that appears in the 8-digit number also appears reversed in the 8-digit reverse.  
    Hence we may keep only those blocks whose reversals are also prime.

3.  The digit 9 can sit inside a prime block only in 79 or 97, so every 9 must be next to a 7.

5.  Joining each admissible middle block to the fixed ends 97——79 produces three candidate

          97 3 1 3 1 79  =  97,313,179.

6.  Primality test  
      • 97 311 379 is divisible by 11 (difference of alternating-place sums = 0), so it is composite.  
      • 97 131 379 is prime.  
      • 97 313 179 is prime.

Step 1  –  Look at the right-hand numbers

They are all perfect squares: 9 = 3², 1 = 1², 16 = 4², 64 = 8².  
So the Quocorrians first produce some intermediate value (call it R) and then square it.

Step 2  –  Find that intermediate value R  
Take the square root of each right-hand side:  
R = 3, 1, 4, 8 respectively.

Step 3  –  Relate R to the original expression  
Notice that if we replace the given operation by its “opposite” (addition ↔ subtraction, multiplication ↔ division) and then subtract 3, we obtain exactly those R’s:

• 2 + 2   →   2 – 2 = 0; 0 – 3 = –3; |–3| = 3  
• 4 × 1   →   4 ÷ 1 = 4; 4 – 3 = 1  
• 5 – 2   →   5 + 2 = 7; 7 – 3 = 4  
• –3 + 2  →  –3 – 2 = –5; –5 – 3 = –8; |–8| = 8  

(The absolute value isn’t essential, because the final squaring makes the sign irrelevant.)

So the Quocorrian rule is:

1. Replace the indicated arithmetic operation with its opposite

2. Evaluate the new (ordinary) expression.  
3. Subtract 3 from the result.  
4. Square what you get.

Reasoning and construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 2001 is close to 2000, and it factors as 2001 = 3 × 23 × 29.  
   That suggests looking for a large multiple of 3 and then adding 1.

2. A convenient way to obtain a large multiple of 3 is to force a factor 666,  
   because 666 × 3 = 1998 and 1998 + 3 = 2001 (so we can finish with “+2 +1”).

3. How can we get 666 from the remaining digits?  
   666 = (9 × 8 × 37) ÷ 4, since 9×8 = 72 and 72×37 = 2664, and 2664 ÷4 = 666.

4. We still need 37.  A quick check shows 37 = 7 + 6×5 uses digits 7,6,5 beautifully.

5. That leaves the digits 3,2,1; after generating 666 we multiply by 3 (to get 1998) and then add 2 and 1 to hit 2001.

All digits 9–1 are used exactly once, only the allowed operations appear, and the result is indeed 2001.

The bases A and C are single decimal digits 1–9 (they cannot be 0 – otherwise the product would be 0, not a 4-digit number).  
Because N ≤ 9999, every power that can appear in (1) must itself be ≤ 9999.

       The only power in this interval is 81 = 9^2.  
       With C = 9, D = 2 we obtain

       A^B · C^D = 32 · 81 = 2592 = ABCD.

 B  ≥ 6 ⇒ A^B ≥ 64, and (25CD)/64 < 42; no power lies in this interval.  
 Hence the unique solution with A = 2 is 2592.

A = 3  
 A^B takes the values 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187 for B = 1 … 7.  
 In each case 3BCD/A^B is examined and never equals an admissible power.  
 No solution.

A = 4  
 A^B = 4,16,64,256,1024,4096 for B = 1 … 6.  
 Again, 4BCD/A^B never equals a power on the list.  
 No solution.

A = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
 The same check (always a handful of quotients) rules out every possibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Conclude uniqueness.  
The only quadruple of digits that survives the above elimination is

  A = 2, B = 5, C = 9, D = 2,

giving the number 2592, and we have already verified

  2592 = 2^5 · 9^2.

Therefore 2592 is the lone four-digit number whose own digits (A,B,C,D) satisfy ABCD = A^B · C^D.

Final answer: 2592",

“Using 9 different digits chosen from 0–9 (so exactly one digit is omitted) form the largest possible 9-digit number that is divisible by 11.”

Solution, written step-by-step.

1.  Divisibility rule for 11  
   For any integer, let S₁ be the sum of the digits in the odd positions (counting from the right) and let S₂ be the sum of the digits in the even positions.  
   The number is divisible by 11 ⇔ S₁ − S₂ ≡ 0 (mod 11).

   For a 9-digit number the pattern of positions is  

            9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
   (left)   O E O E O E O E O   (right)

   Hence there are 5 odd–position digits and 4 even–position digits.

2.  Start with the largest leading digits  
   A number beginning with 9 is larger than any number beginning with 8 or below, so the first digit must be 9.  
   Among the remaining digits the largest available for the 2nd position is 8, so we insist the number start with 98………

3.  Fix notation  
   Let m be the one digit we leave out.  
   Let the 9 digits we actually use be partitioned like this:

      odd positions : 9, a, b, c, d        (sum S₁)
      even positions: 8, p, q, r           (sum S₂)

   All letters stand for distinct digits still to be chosen from {0,…,9}\{m,9,8}.

4.  Translate the 11-divisibility condition  

         S₁ − S₂  =  (9+a+b+c+d) − (8+p+q+r)  =  11k             (k = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2)

   but also

         S₁ + S₂  =  45 − m                                        (total of all 9 digits)

   Adding the two equations gives

         2S₂  =  34 − m − 11k      →      S₂ = (34 − m − 11k) / 2

   Because S₂ is an integer, 34 − m − 11k must be even.  Trying k = –2, –1, 0, 1, 2 shows that the only viable choice that lets us keep the 98 prefix and still have large digits is k = 1, i.e. we want

         S₁ − S₂ = 11.                                         (1)

   Under (1) the previous formula simplifies to

         S₂ = (34 − m)/2,          S₁ = S₂ + 11                 (2)

   Since S₂ is an integer, m must be even, so m ∈ {0,2,4,6}.

5.  Examine each possible omitted digit m

   a) m = 0 :  S₂ = 17.  
      We already have 8 in the even positions, so the other three even-position digits must add to 9.  
      The choice {6,2,1} is best, because it places the largest digit 6 in an even position that is further to the left than any of the smaller digits.  
      Thus  even set = {8,6,2,1}.  
      The remaining digits are {3,4,5,7}.  They, along with 9, automatically give S₁ = 28 (since 28−17 = 11), so

         odd set  = {9,7,5,4,3}.                                (3)

   b) m = 2, 4 or 6 gives S₂ = 16, 15 or 14 respectively.  
      In every one of those cases the third digit (the left-most odd-position digit after 98) becomes 6 or less, which makes the whole nine-digit number start with 986… or 985…, hence smaller than the candidate coming from (3).  
      Therefore we can already discard m = 2,4,6.

   So omitting 0 (m = 0) is the only way to keep the largest possible front part 987…

6.  Arrange the digits from (3) so the number is as large as possible

   The nine places are 9 8 7 6 5 2 4 1 3 if we put

        odd positions (from left to right) : 9,7,5,4,3
        even positions                   : 8,6,2,1

   Writing them in order from the most significant (left) to the least (right) gives

        9 8 7 6 5 2 4 1 3   =  987 652 413

7.  Verify the 11-divisibility quickly

        odd–position sum  = 9+7+5+4+3 = 28
        even-position sum = 8+6+2+1   = 17
        difference        = 28 − 17   = 11  → divisible by 11.

8.  Show it is the absolute maximum  
   • Any 9-digit number not starting with 9 is automatically smaller.  
   • With first digit 9, the largest second digit possible is 8, and we have achieved it.  
   • Among all numbers beginning 98, the third digit cannot exceed 7 (9 and 8 are already used); we have 7.  
   • Given the prefix 987, we showed in step 5 that only the choice m = 0 allows the fourth digit to be as large as 6; all other feasible cases make the third digit smaller than 7, so they are lexicographically smaller long before the fourth digit is reached.  
   • The remaining digits are then forced by condition (1), and placing them in descending order in each parity class maximises every subsequent position.

   Hence no larger 9-digit number made of 9 distinct decimal digits can satisfy divisibility by 11.

Let a and b be the two original numbers and ⊙ the ordinary (+, −, ×, ÷) operation that appears in the statement.  
We look for a transformation f(a, b, ⊙) that makes every given line true:

2 + 2 → 12  
5 − 3 → 62  
3 × 4 → 61  
6 ÷ 3 → 83

Step-by-step deduction.

1.  Notice that each right-hand side exceeds the ordinary result of the displayed operation by a fairly large positive offset:
   • 2+2 = 4, but written as 12 (an extra 8)  
   • 5−3 = 2, but written as 62 (an extra 60)  
   • 3×4 = 12, but written as 61 (an extra 49)  
   • 6÷3 = 2, but written as 83 (an extra 81)

   The surpluses 8, 60, 49, 81 look suspiciously like perfect squares minus a small adjustment: 4² = 16, 8² = 64, 7² = 49, 9² = 81.  They are in fact exactly (a+b)² less the ordinary result, e.g.

        (2+2)² = 4² = 16 ; 16 – 4 = 12 , gives 4 (ordinary) + (–4) = 12
        (5+3)² = 8² = 64 ; 64 – 2 = 62
        (3+4)² = 7² = 49 ; 49 +12 = 61
        (6+3)² = 9² = 81 ; 81 + 2 = 83

2.  Rearranging shows that the displayed answer equals

        (ordinary result using −a and −b)  +  (a + b)².

   Because negating both inputs flips the sign for + and −, but leaves × and ÷ unchanged, the rule can be stated cleanly as:

        Quocorrian rule:
        f(a, b, ⊙) = ( (−a) ⊙ (−b) )  +  (a + b)².

   Checking:

        • 2+2: (−2)+(−2)=−4 ; (2+2)²=16 ; −4+16=12 ✓
        • 5−3: (−5)−(−3)=−5+3=−2 ; 8²=64 ; −2+64=62 ✓
        • 3×4: (−3)×(−4)=12 ; 7²=49 ; 12+49=61 ✓
        • 6÷3: (−6)÷(−3)=2 ; 9²=81 ; 2+81=83 ✓

   All four statements are satisfied, so the rule is correct.

3.  Apply the rule to 1 − 3:

        a = 1,  b = 3,  operation = subtraction.

        (−a) − (−b) = (−1) − (−3) = −1 + 3 = 2
        (a + b)² = (1 + 3)² = 4² = 16
        f(1, 3, −) = 2 + 16 = 18

Hence, in the Quocorrian system,

1 − 3 = 18.
