{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm\" said the wrestler.\nThe swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds.

A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment.

As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip.

The hint specifically directs attention to the P.S. section of the postcard, suggesting it contains a secret message. The provided modified P.S. with capitalized first letters is a strong indicator of how to extract this message.\n\nStep 2: Extract the hidden message from the P.S.\nThe P.S. is given as:\n\"Isaac Newton:\nNear Orange Bags Lying East.\nGets As Strange Equally Slowly.\"\n\nThe capitalization of the first letter of each word in the two sentences (as shown in the hint's slightly modified version) is a classic riddle technique for extracting a message. Let's take the first letter of each capitalized word:\nFrom \"Near Orange Bags Lying East\": N, O, B, L, E\nFrom \"Gets As Strange Equally Slowly\": G, A, S, E, S\n\nStep 3: Combine the extracted letters.\nPutting these letters together in order yields the phrase: N O B L E G A S E S, which spells \"NOBLE GASES\". This is the secret message hidden in the P.S.\n\nStep 4: Understand the meaning of the secret message.\n\"Noble Gases\" refers to a group of chemical elements in the periodic table (Group 18): Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), Radon (Rn), and Oganesson (Og). These elements are known for their low chemical reactivity, often referred to as being inert.\n\nStep 5: Search for further clues within the postcard that point to a specific noble gas as the password.\nThe password is likely one of the noble gases or something related to them. Let's re-examine the P.S. sentences and the main body of the postcard.\n\nStep 6: Examine the P.S. sentences for additional clues.\nThe first sentence is \"Near Orange Bags Lying East.\" The word \"Orange\" is prominent. Neon is famously used in \"Neon signs\" which glow with a reddish-orange light when an electric current is passed through the gas. This provides a strong connection between \"Orange\" and Neon.\n\nStep 7: Consider the attribution \"Isaac Newton:\" in the P.S.\nIsaac Newton was a celebrated scientist known for his work on optics and the study of light and color. He demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors (ROYGBIV). The use of Neon to produce specific colors of light (particularly orange-red) aligns with Newton's area of study, reinforcing the connection to Neon.\n\nStep 8: Examine the main body of the postcard for supporting clues.\nThe main body tells a story about a niece and ends with the sentence: \"She always shows a lot of toughness.\" The concept of \"toughness\" can be related to the chemical property of noble gases. Noble gases are chemically inert, meaning they are resistant to reacting with other elements. This lack of reactivity can be described as chemical \"toughness\". This clue supports the idea that the password is a noble gas.\n\nStep 9: Synthesize the converging clues.\nThe P.S. reveals the category \"NOBLE GASES\". Within the P.S., the word \"Orange\" and the name \"Isaac Newton\" (associated with light and color) strongly point towards Neon, which is known for its orange-red light in signs and its connection to the study of light. The main body adds the concept of \"toughness\", which describes the chemical inertness characteristic of all noble gases, including Neon.\n\nStep 10: Conclude the password.\nBased on the overwhelming evidence pointing towards Neon from multiple parts of the riddle (P.S. first letters, word \"Orange\" in P.S., \"Isaac Newton\" attribution, and \"toughness\" in the main body), the password is the name of this noble gas.\n\nThe password is NEON.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{NEON}$.", "Status": true}

He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden).

Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.

Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).\nWhich vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?\n Hint: Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ", "Hint": "Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ", "Human Solution": "Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.\nExplanation:\n1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.\nRadishes are 25th or 27th.\nPeppers are 28th or 30th.\n1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli\nBroccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)\n3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.\nLettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )\nTomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.\n2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.\nSaturday the 25th is East.\n1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden\nSo East, 25th is not Tomatoes.\nSo Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.\nAnd 3 days later 28th = peppers.\n3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).\nSo Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.\n1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.\nWest is 29th.\n3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.\nSo Lettuce is one or two rows.\n2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\nNorthwest is 2 or 4 rows.\n1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.\nRadishes are not one or five.\nBroccoli is not five or four.\nTomatoes is not one or two.\n2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.\nNorthwest is broccoli.\nLettuce has one row.\n2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.\nSo South is three rows.\nRadishes are four.\n3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.\nSo planted 3 in south on 28.\nFive rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.\nSummary:\nTomatoes, Five, 27th, North\nPeppers, Three, 28th, South\nRadishes, Four, 25th, East\nLettuce, one, 29th, West\nBroccoli, two, 30th, Northwest", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}
{"ID": 12, "Question": "Question: You are given a stack of bingo cards.  Your task is to find a specific card.  Given the following clues, what is the number arrangement of that card?\nColumns, left to right, are: B (contains numbers 1 through 15), I (contains numbers 16 through 30), N (contains numbers 31 through 45), G (contains numbers 46 through 60), O (contains numbers 61 through 75).  Rows, top to bottom, are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  An example of coordinate nomenclature: B1 identifies column B row 1.  N3 is a free space (contains no number).  No number appears more than once.\n1) Each numeral (0 through 9) appears one time in Row 1.\n2) The sum of the numbers in Row 4 is a square number.\n3) There is only one two-digit prime number in each row.\n4) The range of the numbers in Column N is 8.\n5) Each number in Column G has a tens digit that is less than the units digit.\n6) Each number in Column O is odd.\n7) In only one column are the numbers in descending order from top to bottom.\n8) Each column has only one numeral that appears exactly two times.\n9) The smallest number in each column is located in Row 5.\n10) The sums of each column share a single common prime factor.\n11) The numeral 5 only appears one time on the card.\n12) The sum of the numbers in each diagonal is an odd number.\n13) The product of B3 and O3 has a units digit of 2.\n14) The product of I3 and G3 has a units digit of 4.\n Hint: Start with clue 5!", "Hint": "Start with clue 5!", "Human Solution": "10 24 39 58 67\n9 28 40 49 71\n8 22 -- 47 69\n3 30 42 48 73\n1 20 34 46 61\n1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.\n2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.\n3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.\n4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.\n5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.\n6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.\n7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.\n8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.\n9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.\n10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.\n11) To satisfy clue 14, I3 must be 22.  Finally, to achieve a sum of 124 (multiple of 31), I2 must be 28 and I5 must be 20.", "Model": "GeminiFlash", "PromptType": "hintPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": true}

However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.
