REGULAR\u2019S RULE  \n   \u2013 Each regular keeps in his head whether he has already \u201csignalled\u201d or not.  \n   \u2013 When a regular is taken to the switch room  \n     \u2022 If he has not yet signalled AND switch A is OFF, he turns switch A ON\n        (thereby signalling for the first and only time).  \n     \u2022 Otherwise (either he has already signalled before, or A is already ON),  \n        he flips switch B instead.  \n   \u2013 After a regular has signalled once, he will never touch switch A again; from\n     then on he always flips switch B.\n\n2. COUNTER\u2019S RULE  \n   \u2013 The counter keeps a count C that starts at 0.  \n   \u2013 When the counter is taken to the switch room  \n     \u2022 If switch A is ON, he turns it OFF and increases C by 1.  \n     \u2022 If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B.  \n   \u2013 When C reaches 22 the counter immediately tells the warden  \n      \u201cEvery prisoner has visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nWhy it works\n\n\u2022 Each regular turns switch A from OFF to ON exactly once, the very first time\n  he finds A OFF.  Therefore exactly 22 ON\u2013>OFF events of switch A will ever be\n  performed, one per regular.\n\n\u2022 Only the counter ever turns A from ON back to OFF, so each time he does so\n  he can safely add one to his count C, knowing it represents a distinct\n  prisoner.\n\n\u2022 When C becomes 22, the counter has seen 22 different ON\u2013>OFF events, hence\n  every one of the 22 regulars has signalled and therefore has visited the\n  room at least once.  (The counter himself obviously has visited as well, so\n  all 23 have been in the room.)\n\n\u2022 Because the warden keeps choosing prisoners at random but guarantees that\n  eventually everyone is taken to the room arbitrarily many times, every\n  regular will eventually find A OFF while he has not yet signalled, and will\n  be able to turn it ON.  Thus the counter\u2019s count will eventually reach 22,\n  and the prisoners will eventually be released.\n\n\u2022 At no visit does anyone violate the warden\u2019s rule: every prisoner flips\n  exactly one switch on every visit (A or B as prescribed).\n\nTherefore the above strategy guarantees that the declaration will be made\nexactly once and only after every prisoner has visited the switch room.\n\nFinal answer: Designate one prisoner as counter, use switch A for signalling (regulars turn it ON once, counter turns it OFF and counts), use switch B as a dummy to satisfy the \u201cmust flip one switch\u201d rule; when the counter has turned A OFF 22 times he announces that everyone has visited, which is certain to be true.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens": 1966, "total_tokens": 2371, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1216, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Suppose he now sees 4 black hats \u2013 again an even number.  \n\u2022 The parity that still has to hold is even, so his own hat must be white.  \n\u2022 He says \u201cwhite\u201d, survives, and the parity remains even (because a white hat\n  does not change it).\n\n\u22ef and so on, each person compares\n   (parity he sees)  versus  (parity that is supposed to hold)\nand deduces his own colour with certainty.\n\nWhy it is optimal\n\n\u2022 Persons 9,8,\u2026,1 always guess correctly \u2013 9 certain survivors.  \n\u2022 Person 10 survives with probability \u00bd (he is forced to sacrifice certainty to\n  convey the initial parity bit).\n\nHence\n\n   \u2013 worst-case number of survivors = 9  \n   \u2013 expected number of survivors  = 9 \u00bd\n\nNo conceivable strategy can guarantee all 10 lives, because the very last person\nhas zero information about his own hat; at least one person must face a 50 %\nchance.  Therefore the parity strategy described above is optimal.\n\nFinal answer:  Use the rear person\u2019s single word to announce the parity (even/odd) of black hats he sees; every later person updates that parity when a black hat is correctly identified and deduces his own colour from the comparison.

From A / G = G / C  \u21d2  A\u00b7C = G\u00b2.  \n   G is a single digit, so G\u00b2 \u2208 {1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81}.  \n   Among these, only 4 and 9 can be written as a product of two distinct single digits for which one factor may be 1 (required later).  \n   \u2022 G = 2  \u21d2  G\u00b2 = 4 = 4\u00b71  \u21d2  (A,C) = (4,1).  \n   \u2022 G = 3  \u21d2  G\u00b2 = 9 = 9\u00b71  \u21d2  (A,C) = (9,1).\n\n   Hence we have two candidate triples:\n        (A,G,C) = (4,2,1)   or   (9,3,1).\n\n2.  Because C\u00b7H must be prime, and C = 1, we must have H equal to a prime digit:\n        H \u2208 {2,3,5,7}.\n\n3.  Condition A + D is a perfect square.\n   \u2022 If A = 4  \u21d2  4 + D is a square \u2264 13  \u21d2  only 9 works  \u21d2  D = 5.  \n   \u2022 If A = 9  \u21d2  9 + D is a square \u2264 18  \u21d2  9 (D = 0) or 16 (D = 7).\n\n4.

Possible J: 1,4,8,13.  \n     Digits 1 and 4 are already used, 13 is impossible, so J = 8.  \n   \u2022 If G = 3  \u21d2  3 + J \u2208 {3,6,10,15}.  Possible J: 0 or 7.\n\n5.  Collecting possibilities so far:\n\n   Case 1 : A=4, G=2, C=1, D=5, J=8 (used digits 1,2,4,5,8).  \n   Case 2 : A=9, G=3, C=1 with (D,J) = (0,7) or (7,0).\n\n6.  E\u00b7F must be odd \u21d2 E and F are both odd.  \n   Case 1 still has the odd digits {3,7,9}.  Good.  \n   Case 2 would have only one odd digit left, so Case 2 is impossible.  \n   Hence only Case 1 remains viable.\n\n7.  In Case 1 the unused digits are {0,3,6,7,9}.  \n   H must be prime \u2192 H \u2208 {3,7}.\n\n   \u2022 Try H = 3.  Unused digits now {0,6,7,9}.  \n     E and F (both odd) must be {7,9}.  \n     B and I are the remaining {0,6} (and B + I must be even, which is automatic).  \n     Use E + I = B + H :\n\n          If B = 0,  I = 6 \u2192 0 + 3 = E + 6  impossible.  \n          If B = 6,  I = 0 \u2192 6 + 3 = E + 0 \u21d2 E = 9.\n\n     This gives a consistent assignment:\n          A=4, B=6, C=1, D=5, E=9, F=7, G=2, H=3, I=0, J=8.\n\n   \u2022 Try H = 7.  Quickly gives no solution for E + I = B + H.  \n\n   So the single consistent set of digits is\n        4 6 1 5 9 7 2 3 0 8.\n\nAll conditions check:\n\nA + D = 4 + 5 = 9  (square)  \nG + J = 2 + 8 = 10 (triangular)  \nB + I = 6 + 0 = 6  (even)  \nE\u00b7F = 9\u00b77 = 63 (odd)  \nC\u00b7H = 1\u00b73 = 3 (prime)  \nA/G = 4/2 = 2;  G/C = 2/1 = 2  \nE + I = 9 + 0 = 9 = B + H = 6 + 3.\n\nFinal answer: 4615972308", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4837, "total_tokens": 5020, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3776, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Let m be the largest number of drops we are willing to make in the worst case.  \n   With two balls we can afford to let the first ball break once; afterwards we must\n   search line-by-line with the second ball.  \n   Therefore, if we drop the first ball from heights that are m floors apart,\n   then (m\u20131) apart, then (m\u20132) apart, \u2026, 1 apart, we are guaranteed that the\n   total number of drops never exceeds m:  \n        \u2022 at most (m \u2013 k) drops with the first ball until it breaks,  \n        \u2022 at most k\u20131 further drops with the second ball to search the gap.\n\n2.

Put the 25 stools in a row and mark an occupied stool together with its two neighbours as \u201cforbidden\u2019\u2019 (nobody will ever be allowed to sit on a forbidden stool).  \n   At any moment the free stools form several disjoint blocks.  \n   A new member always sits in a free stool that belongs to the longest block (if there is more than one such block he may choose any of them).  \n   \u2022 If that longest block is at one end of the bar, the only seat whose distance from the\n     rest of the club is maximum is the seat at the very end of the block.  \n   \u2022 If the longest block is surrounded by two occupied stools, the only seat whose\n     minimum distance from the rest is maximum is the exact middle of that block  \n     (if the block has even length the two middle stools are tied).\n\n2.  If at every stage there is a single longest block, the seating order is completely\n    determined and nothing can go \u201cwrong\u201d.  \n    The way to be sure that this happens is to make that longest block a power of two in\n    length; when such a block is split according to the rule it breaks into two unequal\n    blocks, one of which is again a power of two and strictly longer than every other\n    block that already exists.  \n    Therefore the \u201cpower\u2013of\u2013two\u2019\u2019 block remains unique for the whole game and the\n    choices of later members are forced.\n\n3.  At the beginning the bar is one single block of length 25.  \n    After the first member sits on stool k the left block has length k\u22121 and the right\n    block has length 25\u2212k.  \n    For one of these two blocks to be a power of two (and therefore automatically\n    longer than the other) we must have\n\n          k\u22121 = 16  or  25\u2212k = 16 ,\n\n    i.e.\n\n          k = 17   or   k = 9 .\n\n    Those are the only possibilities.\n\n4.  Suppose the first member sits on stool 9 (the case 17 is symmetric).  \n    The right\u2013hand block then has length 16, the left\u2013hand block length 8.  \n    The next member is forced to take stool 25, after which the block 10\u201324 has length\n    15; its middle stool 17 is forced, leaving two blocks of length 7 and one of length 8.\n    The block of length 8 is now the longest one; the next member must take stool 1,\n    producing a block of length 6 and a block of length 5, etc.  \n    Continuing this forced splitting one sees that the occupied stools become\n\n          1,3,5,7, \u2026 ,23,25,\n\n    i.e. every odd\u2013numbered stool.  Thirteen stools are occupied, which is the absolute\n    maximum because no two occupied stools are adjacent.\n\n5.  If any stool other than 9 or 17 is chosen first, the initial split is not 16+8 but\n    something like 14+10, 13+11, 12+12, \u2026 .  \n    After a few steps two different blocks of the same length appear; a member may then\n    choose either of them, and by choosing \u201cbadly\u2019\u2019 he can ensure that at least one odd\n    stool is never used.  In that case fewer than 13 stools are occupied.  \n    Thus no other first stool can guarantee the optimum.\n\nConclusion  \n\nTo be certain that the bar ends up as full as possible, Jim must oblige the first member to sit on stool 9 or on stool 17.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 231, "completion_tokens": 14935, "total_tokens": 15166, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 14144, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Clue 3 demands the yellow suit\u2019s number be odd.\n   In 324 the only odd digit is 3, already the red number, impossible.\n   So 324 is ruled out; only 576 remains.\n\n4. Therefore the row of numbers (left\u2192right) is 5 7 6, i.e. 576.\n\n5. Sam\u2019s number must be 6 (from step 2), so Sam is the rightmost sportsman.\n\n6. The red suit\u2019s number is 7, hence the middle sportsman wears red.\n\n7. The remaining suit (leftmost) must be yellow, and its number 5 is odd, satisfying clue 3.\n\n8. Clue 2 says Tom\u2019s number is smaller than the rightmost sportsman\u2019s number (6),\n   so Tom must be the leftmost sportsman with number 5.\n   Jim is therefore the middle sportsman with number 7.\n\nFinal answer: Tom wears the yellow suit numbered 5 (leftmost); Jim wears the red suit numbered 7 (middle); Sam wears the blue suit numbered 6 (rightmost).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 197, "completion_tokens": 3989, "total_tokens": 4186, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3584, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

What a strategy has to do  \n   \u2022  Before the headbands are put on, the 500 prisoners must agree on one\n      rule that tells every prisoner what colour to shout as a function\n      of the 499 headbands he will be able to see.  \n   \u2022  After the headbands are put on, nobody may move or speak; at the\n      count of ten everyone shouts one word (\u201cblack\u2019\u2019 or \u201cwhite\u2019\u2019).  \n   \u2022  We want to maximise the smallest possible number of correct shouts\n      (the \u201cguaranteed\u2019\u2019 number of survivors).\n\n2.  An upper bound of 250  \n   Take any strategy whatever.  \n   Put the headbands on at random, each colour used with probability \u00bd\n   and independently for every head.  \n   For any fixed strategy and for any particular prisoner, what he\n   shouts is a function of the 499 other heads, and those 499 heads are\n   independent of his own.  Hence, conditioned on what he can see, his\n   own headband is still black with probability \u00bd and white with\n   probability \u00bd.  Therefore his probability of being right is exactly\n   \u00bd.  \n   The expected number of correct shouts is therefore  \n                 500 \u00d7 \u00bd = 250.  \n   If a strategy could guarantee strictly more than 250 survivors for\n   every possible colouring, its expectation would have to be > 250,\n   contradicting the calculation above.  \n   So no strategy can guarantee more than 250 survivors.\n\n3.  A strategy that guarantees 250 survivors  \n   Pair the prisoners in advance:\n\n        (1,2), (3,4), \u2026 , (499,500)\n\n   \u2013 In every pair the first prisoner will imitate the colour he sees on\n     his partner\u2019s head.  \n   \u2013 The second prisoner will shout the opposite colour to the one he\n     sees on his partner\u2019s head.\n\n   Look at any pair.\n\n        \u2022 If the two headbands in the pair are the same colour, the\n          first prisoner (who copies that colour) is right and the\n          second (who says the opposite colour) is wrong.\n\n        \u2022 If the two headbands are different colours, the second\n          prisoner is right and the first is wrong.\n\n   Thus in every pair exactly one member is guaranteed to be correct,\n   independently of what happens anywhere else.

A necessary equation  \n   Because the ten digits describe how many of each digit appear, their total must equal the total number of digits:\n\n   d\u2080 + d\u2081 + \u2026 + d\u2089 = 10.

Then at least 5 digits are non-zero, so those digits contribute at least 5 to the sum in (1); together with d\u2080 \u2264 5 the total would exceed 10.

The remaining three non-zero digits  \n   Because (1) must hold and d\u2080 = 6, the sum of the other nine digits is 4.  \n   Among them there are exactly three non-zero digits (the total number of non-zero digits is 10 \u2013 6 = 4, one of which is d\u2080 itself).  \n   The only way three positive integers can sum to 4 is 2, 1, 1.\n\n   So the multiset of non-zero digits is {6, 2, 1, 1}.\n\n5.

How many diagonals are there of each colour?  \n   For an 8\u00d78 board the values of d run from \u20137 to 7 (15 diagonals) and  \n   the values of s run from 2 to 16 (15 diagonals).\n\n   d\u2013values:  \u20137 \u20136 \u20135 \u20134 \u20133 \u20132 \u20131 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  \n   \u2022 even (dark)  : \u20136 \u20134 \u20132 0 2 4 6   \u2192 7 dark \u201c\\\u201d\u2013diagonals  \n   \u2022 odd  (light) : \u20137 \u20135 \u20133 \u20131 1 3 5 7 \u2192 8 light \u201c\\\u201d\u2013diagonals  \n\n   s\u2013values:   2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  \n   \u2022 even (dark)  : 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 \u2192 8 dark \u201c/\u201d\u2013diagonals  \n   \u2022 odd  (light) : 3 5 7 9 11 13 15    \u2192 7 light \u201c/\u201d\u2013diagonals  \n\n4.  Bishops on one colour are independent of bishops on the other colour, so we may\n   maximise each colour separately.\n\n   Dark squares: we can use at most  \n        min(7 dark \u201c\\\u201d, 8 dark \u201c/\u201d) = 7 bishops.\n\n   Light squares: we can use at most  \n        min(8 light \u201c\\\u201d, 7 light \u201c/\u201d) = 7 bishops.\n\n   Hence the absolute upper bound is 7 + 7 = 14 bishops.\n\n5.

How weighing with a balance works  \n   Put the gold on one pan.  \n   Each weight can be placed either\n      \u2022 on the same pan as the gold (counts \u201cwith\u201d the gold, +),  \n      \u2022 on the opposite pan (subtracts from the gold, \u2013), or  \n      \u2022 not used (0).  \n   Therefore a set of four weights with masses w\u2081,w\u2082,w\u2083,w\u2084 (integers, w\u2081\u2264w\u2082\u2264w\u2083\u2264w\u2084) lets us realise every integer that can be written as  \n        \u03b5\u2081w\u2081 + \u03b5\u2082w\u2082 + \u03b5\u2083w\u2083 + \u03b5\u2084w\u2084 ,\n   where each \u03b5\u1d62 is \u20131, 0 or +1.\n\n2.  The \u201ccontiguous-range\u201d condition  \n   Let S\u2096 be the greatest integer weight that can be guaranteed measurable with the first k weights (S\u2080=0).  \n   Suppose we already have weights whose total reach is S\u2096.  \n   To keep the range continuous after adding the next weight w, it must be possible to weigh S\u2096+1.  \n   Using the old weights we can offset at most S\u2096 ounces; the new weight can go on either pan, so the largest net change it can supply is w.  \n   Hence we need w \u2013 S\u2096 \u2264 S\u2096 + 1, i.e.  \n        w \u2264 2S\u2096 + 1.                               (\u2605)\n\n   If w were any larger, S\u2096+1 could not be achieved, so (\u2605) is a necessary condition.\n\n3.  Choosing the weights to maximise the final reach  \n   To make the final S as large as possible we should choose each weight as large as the constraint (\u2605) allows, i.e.  \n        w = 2S\u2096 + 1.\n\n   Starting from S\u2080 = 0 and applying this rule four times:\n\n       k   weight w\u2096      new reach S\u2096 = S\u2096\u208b\u2081 + w\u2096\n       ------------------------------------------------\n       1        1               1\n       2        3               4\n       3        9              13\n       4       27              40\n\n   So with the weights 1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz and 27 oz every integer number of ounces from 1 up to 40 can be weighed, and the total of all four weights is 40 oz.\n\n4.  Optimality  \n   Because each step used the largest weight allowed by (\u2605), any other choice of four weights can only give a smaller final reach.  \n   Therefore 40 oz is the largest amount that can be guaranteed measurable with exactly four weights on a balance scale.\n\n(For comparison, if the assessor were restricted to putting all weights on the same pan, the best four weights would be 1,2,4,8 and the limit would indeed be 15 oz, but the balance allows the much more powerful scheme above.)\n\nFinal answer: 40", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 165, "completion_tokens": 2918, "total_tokens": 3083, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2240, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Each nominated villager sees k \u2212 1 names.  \n   \u2022 He reasons, \u201cIf I am not nominated, there are k \u2212 1 nominees, so they will all appear on night k \u2212 1.\u201d  \n   \u2022 When nights 1, 2, \u2026 , k \u2212 1 pass with nobody appearing, he eliminates that possibility.  \n   \u21d2 He now knows there must be k nominees and that he is one of them, so every nominee steps forward on night k.\n\nConclusion from what actually happened  \nNo one appeared on nights 1 through 29, but someone (in fact several people) appeared on night 30.  \nApplying the induction above, the first night on which nominees appear is exactly the number of nominees.\n\nTherefore N = 30, and all 30 nominated villagers came forward together on the 30th night.\n\nFinal answer: 30", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 322, "completion_tokens": 2091, "total_tokens": 2413, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1600, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Identify the losing (\u201cP-\u201d) positions.\n\nLet k = 100, so the legal moves are 1,2,\u2026,k eggs.  \nIn such a game the classical result is:\n\nA pile size N is a losing position (P-position) \u21d4 N \u2261 0 (mod k+1).\n\nReason:  \n\u2013 If N is a multiple of k+1, every legal move leaves a non-multiple, so every move goes from a P-position to an N-position (winning for the next player).  \n\u2013 Conversely, if N is not a multiple of k+1, one can remove exactly the remainder r = N mod (k+1) (1 \u2264 r \u2264 k) and leave a multiple of k+1, thereby reaching a P-position.  \nThus multiples of k+1 are precisely the positions from which the previous player can force a win.\n\nHere k+1 = 101.  Therefore:\n\nP-positions = {0, 101, 202, 303, \u2026} (all multiples of 101).\n\nStep 2.

One prisoner is chosen and called the Leader.  \n    All other 22 prisoners are called Ordinary prisoners.\n\n2.  The two switches have names:\n        switch A   = the \u201ctoken\u201d switch  \n        switch B   = the \u201charmless\u201d switch  \n\n   We are told that when the game starts both A and B are OFF.\n\n3.  Behaviour of the Leader  \n   \u2022 Every time he enters the room he looks at switch A.  \n     \u2013 If A is ON he flips A to OFF and adds 1 to a private count.  \n     \u2013 If A is OFF he ignores it and instead flips switch B (whatever its\n       present position is, he reverses it).  \n   \u2022 As soon as his private count reaches 22 he knows that every one of the\n     other 22 prisoners has been in the room at least once, so the next time\n     he is brought out of his cell he tells the warden  \n        \u201cWe have all visited the switch room.\u201d\n\n4.  Behaviour of every Ordinary prisoner  \n   Each Ordinary prisoner keeps one bit of personal memory, \u201cHave-I-already-\n   given-my-token?\u201d  It is initially NO.\n\n   Each time an Ordinary prisoner is taken to the switch room he does this:\n\n   \u2013 If his personal memory is NO and switch A is OFF  \n          \u2192 he flips A to ON (thus placing one token for the Leader)  \n            and sets his personal memory to YES.  \n\n   \u2013 Otherwise  \n          \u2192 he flips switch B (reverses its position).  \n\n   Thus an Ordinary prisoner turns switch A on at most once in his life;\n   afterwards he always contents himself with toggling B.\n\nWhy the strategy works\n\n\u2022 Only Ordinary prisoners ever turn A from OFF to ON, and each of them does\n  that at most once.  Therefore exactly one token is deposited for each\n  Ordinary prisoner.  \n\n\u2022 Only the Leader ever turns A from ON to OFF, and he increments his counter\n  exactly once for every such action.  Hence the Leader\u2019s counter can never\n  exceed 22.\n\n\u2022 Whenever an Ordinary prisoner still holding his token enters the room he\n  will find A OFF sooner or later (because only the Leader resets A to OFF,\n  and every prisoner is guaranteed infinitely many visits).  Hence every\n  Ordinary prisoner will eventually deposit his one token, so the Leader\u2019s\n  counter will eventually reach 22.\n\n\u2022 When the Leader\u2019s counter first becomes 22, each Ordinary prisoner must\n  already have deposited his unique token, i.e. every prisoner has visited\n  at least once.  Therefore the Leader\u2019s declaration will never be wrong.\n\n\u2022 Because the warden keeps selecting prisoners forever, sooner or later the\n  Leader will both reach the count 22 and be selected again, so the\n  declaration is eventually made and the prisoners are freed with certainty.\n\nAll prisoners obey the warden\u2019s rule \u201cexactly one switch must be flipped on\neach visit\u201d: in every situation the prescribed action changes precisely one\nswitch.\n\nHence the plan is correct and guarantees eventual release.\n\nFinal answer: A strategy that designates one Counter prisoner who counts 22 \u201cON\u201d settings of switch A supplied once each by the other 22 prisoners, while everyone always flips exactly one switch, guarantees that the Counter will eventually know that all prisoners have visited and can safely announce it, thereby ensuring freedom.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 538, "completion_tokens": 3179, "total_tokens": 3717, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2432, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Use the day whose total is 32.  \n   Without the house 10 the largest possible daily sum is  \n   9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30 < 32,  \n   so 10 must be one of Friday\u2019s four houses.  \n   The other three houses must then add to 22.\n\n   The only triples of distinct numbers \u2264 9 that add to 22 are  \n          {9, 8, 5}\u2003and\u2003{9, 7, 6}.  \n   Consequently\n\n   \u2022 9 must be among the served houses, and  \n   \u2022 at least one of 5 or 7 must be among the served houses.\n\n5.  Eliminate impossible pairs.\n\n   (2,10)  eliminates 10 \u2192 impossible (step 4 requires 10).  \n   (3,9)   eliminates 9 \u2192 impossible (step 4 requires 9).  \n   (5,7)   eliminates both 5 and 7 \u2192 impossible (step 4 requires 5 or 7).\n\n   The only pair still viable is (4,8).\n\n6.  Check that (4,8) really works.  \n   With houses {1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10} served three times each, one possible\n   weekly schedule is\n\n        Mon  10 5 2 1   (sum 18)\n        Tue   6 3 2 1   (sum 12)\n        Wed  10 7 5 1   (sum 23)\n        Thu   9 5 3 2   (sum 19)\n        Fri  10 9 7 6   (sum 32)\n        Sat   9 7 6 3   (sum 25)\n\n   Every listed house appears exactly three times, none of 4 or 8 appears at\n   all, and each day has four distinct houses with the required sum.  Hence\n   the pair (4,8) is indeed feasible.\n\nSince all other pairs are impossible and (4,8) is possible, these are the two\nhouses that received no mail.\n\nFinal answer: Houses 4 and 8 received no mail.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens": 11464, "total_tokens": 11855, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 10688, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Relation between the 2nd and 4th sets (clue 4).  \n        (CD) \u00d7 4  =  (GH reversed)  =  10 H + G.\n\n    Since GH itself must contain the unique 8, the product (CD)\u00d74 must be a two-digit number with exactly one 8 and no 0, 5, 7.\n\n    The two\u2013digit multiples of 4 that meet this are 28, 48, 68, 84.  \n    28 gives a 1\u2013digit second set (07), and 68 requires a forbidden 7 in CD=17, so only\n\n           CD = 12  (12\u00d74 = 48)     or     CD = 21  (21\u00d74 = 84)\n\n    are possible, giving respectively\n\n           GH = 84                    or     GH = 48.\n\n    Because GH must be the last set and contain the only 8, both candidates are acceptable so far.\n\n4.  One entire set is 66 (clue 7).  This cannot be the fourth set (it contains no 8), so 66 must be either the first or the third set.\n\n5.  Examine each of the two possibilities from step 3.\n\n    a)  If CD = 12 and GH = 84  \n        \u2013  The \u201cfirst-digit-of-third + second-digit-of-second\u201d condition (clue 1) would be  \n              (first digit of third) + 2  < 8.  \n           If the third set were 66, this gives 6+2 = 8, not < 8.  \n           If the first set were 66, then the third set would begin with something \u2264 4, but the lone remaining 8 is already used.  \n           In every case CD = 12 fails clue 1.  Hence CD \u2260 12.\n\n    b)  Therefore CD = 21 and GH = 48.  \n        Here the second digit of the second set is 1, so clue 1 demands  \n              (first digit of third) + 1  < 8.  \n        Taking the third set to be 66 gives 6 + 1 = 7, which satisfies the inequality.  So\n\n              third set = 66.\n\n6.  Determine the first set using clues 3 and 6.\n\n        \u2022 product of its digits is between 20 and 30;  \n        \u2022 sum of its digits is not 10;  \n        \u2022 it may not exceed 90;  \n        \u2022 it cannot contain the digit 8.\n\n    The only pair of allowed digits with product in (20,30) is 3 and 9 (3\u00d79 = 27).  \n    The sums are 3+9 = 12 and 9+3 = 12 \u2260 10, but the number 93 exceeds 90, forbidden by clue 5.  \n    Therefore the first set must be 39.\n\n7.  Assemble the four sets obtained:\n\n        First set   : 39  \n        Second set  : 21  \n        Third set   : 66  \n        Fourth set  : 48\n\n8.  Final verification.\n\n        \u2022 66 is present.  \n        \u2022 Only one 8, in the last set.  \n        \u2022 Digits 5 and 7 never appear.  \n        \u2022 First-digit-of-third + second-digit-of-second = 6 + 1 = 7 < 8.  \n        \u2022 39 has digit sum 12 (\u226010) and digit product 27 (between 20 and 30).  \n        \u2022 21\u00d74 = 84, whose reverse is 48, the fourth set.  \n        \u2022 No set exceeds 90.\n\nAll eight clues are satisfied.\n\nFinal answer: 39-21-66-48", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 469, "completion_tokens": 4492, "total_tokens": 4961, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3520, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

With Tuesday = R G, Wednesday must contain B but not R or G, and must not repeat Monday\u2019s pair.  \n   Hence Wednesday = B Y.\n\n6.  Thursday must contain G (given) and cannot contain B or Y (rule 2 with Wednesday).  \n   The only admissible partner for G which is not a repeat of Tuesday\u2019s R G and does not break rule 7 (R with K) is K.  \n   Therefore Thursday = G K.\n\n7.  Friday must contain B again, must not contain G or K (from Thursday), and must avoid Y (rule 6).  \n   Hence Friday = B R.\n\n8.  Saturday cannot contain B or R (rule 2 with Friday).  \n   The remaining allowable pairs are G Y and Y K.  \n   Choosing G Y makes Sunday impossible (no unused legal B-pair remains), so Saturday must be Y K.\n\n9.  Finally, Sunday cannot contain Y or K (rule 2 with Saturday) and must contain B; the only unused legal partner is G.  \n   Sunday = B G.\n\nThe complete week is therefore:\n\nMon  B K  \nTue  R G  \nWed  B Y  \nThu  G K  \nFri  B R  \nSat  Y K  \nSun  B G  \n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nHence on Saturday Mr Peter wears the colours yellow and black.\n\nFinal answer: yellow and black", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens": 3701, "total_tokens": 4027, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3072, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Hence Zeke must be the first man to bring the boat back, placing him on the starting side, with the boat, while his passenger is marooned across the river; that makes a second outward trip with Zeke impossible.\n\nCase (b) also fails: if Zeke rows a return trip, he ends up on the starting side while his former passenger is across the river. From that position the last outward trip must carry Walter (who cannot row) and somebody who can row with Walter. That \u201csomebody\u201d cannot be Xavier (he would need Yoshi as passenger), so it would have to be Yoshi. But Yoshi is stranded on the far bank; Zeke cannot bring him back because the boat is already on the starting side. Contradiction. Hence Zeke cannot row twice.\n\nTherefore neither Walter, nor Xavier, nor Zeke can be the double rower.\n\n4.  Yoshi must be the man who rows twice, and a consistent schedule exists  \nSince exactly one man rows twice and the other three do not, Yoshi must be the one.  \nA concrete, rule-compliant sequence is\n\nTrip 1\u2003(S \u2192 D)\u2003X rows, Y is passenger.  \nTrip 2\u2003(D \u2192 S)\u2003Y rows back alone.  \nTrip 3\u2003(S \u2192 D)\u2003Z rows, W is passenger.  \nTrip 4\u2003(D \u2192 S)\u2003W rows back alone.  \nTrip 5\u2003(S \u2192 D)\u2003Y rows, W is passenger.\n\nRowing counts:\u2003X 1\u2003Y 2\u2003Z 1\u2003W 1.  \nAll conditions are met, so the arrangement is possible and Yoshi is indeed the only man who rows twice.\n\nFinal answer: Yoshi", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 405, "completion_tokens": 8456, "total_tokens": 8861, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 7552, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

When the Counter\u2019s mental tally reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden\n    \u201cAll of us have visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nWhy the strategy works  \n\na)  Each non-counter prisoner turns switch A from OFF to ON exactly once and can\n    never do so a second time.  \nb)  Every time the Counter later comes in and sees A ON he knows that ON was set\n    by a prisoner who had not been credited before; he turns A OFF and raises his\n    count by one.  \nc)  Therefore the Counter\u2019s count can never exceed the actual number of\n    prisoners who have visited.  \nd)  Because the warden is assumed to bring every prisoner into the room\n    infinitely often, every non-counter will eventually find A OFF and make his\n    single contribution.  \ne)  Consequently, after sufficient time the Counter\u2019s tally will inevitably\n    reach 22 (the number of prisoners other than himself). At that moment every\n    prisoner must already have visited at least once, so C\u2019s announcement is\n    certainly correct.  \n\nf)  If, on the other hand, some prisoner has not yet visited, that prisoner has\n    not contributed to the count, so the Counter\u2019s total cannot yet be 22 and he\n    will not speak. Hence a premature (and false) declaration is impossible.\n\nThus the prisoners are guaranteed eventual freedom, and all requirements of the\nproblem (including \u201cmove exactly one switch each visit\u201d) are satisfied.\n\nFinal answer: The prisoners can ensure release by appointing one counter who flips switch A OFF each time he sees it ON and counts 22 such events, while every other prisoner turns A ON exactly once (the first time he finds it OFF) and otherwise flips switch B.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 635, "completion_tokens": 1902, "total_tokens": 2537, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1280, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

When a lock is worked, the water that lifts (or lowers) the boat comes from the pound immediately above the lock and, after the boat has left, is discharged into the pound immediately below.  \n2. Thus every time a boat goes through any single lock, one lock-chamber volume is simply moved down one level; it is not lost from the canal system.  \n3. In a flight of 13 locks the same thing happens successively, so one lockful of water is moved down at each step. After the whole flight has been negotiated, the net result is that exactly one lock-chamber volume has travelled from the summit pound (above the top lock) to the pound below the bottom lock.  \n4.

How many people can ever be seated?  \n   \u2022  When somebody takes a stool, the two stools next to him can never again be used (a member may not sit right next to anyone).  \n   \u2022  Thus an interior member \u201cuses up\u2019\u2019 3 stools (his own plus the two neighbours).  \n   \u2022  A member who sits on an end\u2013stool (1 or 25) \u201cuses up\u2019\u2019 only 2 stools, because he has only one neighbour.\n\n   Suppose x members finally sit on the two ends and y members sit somewhere in the interior.  \n   The 25 stools that exist have all been used up, so  \n           2x + 3y  \u2264 25.  \n   (Equality actually holds, for otherwise some stool would still be available.)\n\n   If neither end is taken, x = 0 and 3y = 25 is impossible; the most we could get is y = 8 (24 stools), i.e. 8 members.  \n   If exactly one end is taken, x = 1 and 2 + 3y \u2264 25 \u21d2 y \u2264 7, i.e. at most 8 members again.  \n   If both ends are taken, x = 2 and 4 + 3y = 25 \u21d2 y = 7, so the absolute maximum possible is  \n           x + y = 2 + 7 = 9 members.  \n   Therefore no arrangement can seat more than 9 people, and to reach 9 we \u200bmust\u200b have both end stools occupied.\n\n2.  How can we be sure both ends will indeed be taken?  \n   Jim obliges the first arrival to choose one of two special stools.  \n   Make those two stools #1 and #25.\n\n   \u2022  Suppose the first member sits on stool 1.  \n     \u2013  The seat that is farthest from him is stool 25 (distance 24), so the second member will inevitably take stool 25.  \n   \u2022  From that moment on the only free stools lie in the block 3\u201323.  \n     \u2013  That block has 21 stools, and it is flanked by the now-forbidden stools 2 and 24.  \n     \u2013  Repeating the \u201csit as far away as possible\u2019\u2019 rule successively bisects the remaining free block, and each new member always occupies the middle stool of a free block of \u200blength 3\u200b, leaving two 1-stool blocks that are now forbidden.  \n     \u2013  Consequently exactly one member is placed in each of the seven disjoint 3-stool blocks   {3,4,5}, {6,7,8}, \u2026 , {21,22,23}.  \n\n   Altogether we obtain  \n           stools 1 and 25 (the two ends)  +  one stool from each of the seven 3-blocks  \n           = 2 + 7 = 9 members,\n\n   and no further member can be seated because every remaining empty stool is next to an occupied one.\n\n   The situation is completely symmetric if the first member is forced to take stool 25; the second member will then take stool 1, and the same reasoning shows that again exactly 9 people will be seated.\n\n3.  Why won\u2019t any other first stool always work?  \n   If the first person does \u200bnot\u200b sit at an end, at most one end can be taken later (at best the second arrival sits there), so from the inequality 2x + 3y \u2264 25 we obtain x \u2264 1 \u21d2 x + y \u2264 8.  Thus starting anywhere except at an end can never guarantee the maximal 9 seats.\n\nTherefore Jim should decree that the first customer must choose stool 1 or stool 25.

Two of the clue words \u2013 BLAME and GRABS \u2013 must each share exactly 2 letters\n    with S.  \n    BLAME = {B,L,A,M,E}  \n    GRABS = {G,R,A,B,S}\n\n    The only letters common to both of these sets are A and B.  \n    \u2022  If S contains A and B (and none of L,M,E,G,R,S) it will share\n       A,B with BLAME and A,B with GRABS \u2013 exactly 2 with each, as required.  \n    \u2022  Therefore A and B are in S, while L,M,E,G,R,S are not.\n\n3.

The word KARMA must share exactly 2 letters with S.  \n    KARMA = {K,A,R,M,A}.  \n    With A and K already present, we obtain the required 2 letters and must not\n    add R or M (they would raise the total).\n\n5.  S still lacks two letters.  \n    \u2022  MAGIC (M,A,G,I,C) currently shares only A with S, so we must add exactly\n      one more of {M,G,I,C}.

Restate Priscilla\u2019s assertion with the two ordinary days P and F.\n\nShe says that, on the future day F, the then-\u201ctoday\u2019\u2019 (namely F itself) will be as far from Sunday as the past day P was from Sunday.\n\nIn symbols (measuring \u201cdistance from Sunday\u2019\u2019 as the smaller of the two counts forward or backward round the week):\n\ndistance(Sunday, F)  =  distance(Sunday, P).\n\nStep 3.  Express everything with numbers.\n\nIndex the days of the week by\n0  =  Sunday, 1 = Monday, \u2026 , 6 = Saturday.\n\nWrite T = x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 6).  \nThen\n\nP = x \u2013 3  (mod 7),         F = x + 3  (mod 7).\n\nThe distance of a numbered day d from Sunday (0) is  \nD(d) = min {d, 7 \u2013 d}  (0 \u2264 D(d) \u2264 3).\n\nPriscilla\u2019s condition is therefore\n\nD(x \u2013 3) = D(x + 3).                               (\u2605)\n\nStep 4.  Solve equation (\u2605).\n\nBecause 0 \u2264 D(d) \u2264 3, equality can occur only if D(x \u2013 3) = D(x + 3) is one of the values 0, 1, 2 or 3.\n\nNotice that the two numbers (x \u2013 3) and (x + 3) differ by 6, so one of them is at most 3 and the other is at least 3.  Consequently their two distances from 0 are equal only when both distances are exactly 3, which happens precisely when\n\nx \u2013 3 \u2261 4  (mod 7)   and   x + 3 \u2261 3  (mod 7),\n\ni.e. when x \u2261 0  (mod 7).\n\nThus T = 0, which is Sunday.\n\nStep 5.

Determine Carol\u2019s husband.  \nSince Carol is Mike\u2019s sister, she cannot be married to Mike; therefore H = Jack.\n\nSo Jack is alive (he is H) and Lily is alive (she is S\u2081).  \nBy (a): Lily argued exactly once with Jack.\n\nStep 4.  Identify the victim.  \nJack and Carol are both alive (H and S\u2082 cannot be victims).  \nThus the victim is either Mike or Lily.\n\nBut Lily is alive (she is S\u2081), so the only possible victim is Mike.\n\nStep 5.  Check consistency with statement (b).  \nIf V = Mike, his spouse W cannot be his own sister Carol, so W must be Lily.  \nNow (b) reads: S\u2082 (Carol) argued twice with W (Lily). Both women are alive, so this is possible and consistent with (a) (Lily\u2019s single argument with Jack).\n\nAll conditions are satisfied:\n\n\u2022 Jack is married to Carol.  \n\u2022 Mike is married to Lily.  \n\u2022 Jack\u2019s sister = Lily argued once with Jack.  \n\u2022 Mike\u2019s sister = Carol argued twice with Lily.  \n\u2022 The only person not appearing in either argument role is Mike, so Mike is indeed the victim.\n\nNo other assignment of \u201csisters\u2019\u2019 and \u201cspouses\u2019\u2019 meets every requirement without contradiction, hence the solution is unique.\n\nFinal answer: Mike", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens": 7122, "total_tokens": 7421, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 6464, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Walter\u2019s (W\u2019s) rowing.  \n\u2022  Fact 3 says W can row only when he is alone, therefore only on an R-trip.  \n\u2022  Fact 5 says every man rows at least once, so W rows one of the two R-trips \u2013 no more and no less (because he can never row an F-trip).\n\nStep 2.  Can Xavier (X) row an R-trip?  \nAssume X rows some R-trip.  Because a return trip starts on the destination side, X first has to be taken to that side.  If X himself rows the preceding F-trip, his passenger must be Yoshi (Y) (Fact 4); if he is a passenger, some other man rows.  After X rows back alone, he is again on the starting side together with W, while Y is on the opposite side.  The only men left on the starting side just before the last crossing would then be W and X, but  \n\u2022  W cannot row an F-trip at all, and  \n\u2022  X cannot row with W as passenger (Fact 4).  \nHence the last crossing would be impossible.  Therefore X never rows an R-trip; he rows exactly one F-trip, and when he does, Y must be his passenger.\n\nStep 3.  Who rows the second R-trip?  \nIt cannot be X (see Step 2).  Suppose Zeke (Z) rows an R-trip.  To do so he must first be ferried to the destination side, and the only way to put him back on the starting side afterward is for him to row there himself.  But when Z arrives back alone, the only men remaining on the starting side for the very last crossing are Z and W.  Again W cannot row an F-trip, so Z would have to row a second time, giving him at least three total trips (two returns and one forward), which is impossible because only one person is allowed to row twice.  Hence Z cannot row any R-trip.\n\nConsequently Y must row the R-trip that W does not row.\n\nStep 4.  Counting the rows.  \nSo far we have  \n\u2022  W\u2003\u2013\u20031 row (an R-trip),  \n\u2022  Y\u2003\u2013\u20031 row (the other R-trip),  \n\u2022  X\u2003\u2013\u20031 row (the single F-trip he is allowed to make, with Y as passenger),  \n\u2022  Z\u2003\u2013\u2003at least 1 row (some F-trip).\n\nThat accounts for four of the five trips.  One F-trip is still unassigned, and the only man who has not yet reached his quota of \u201cat least once\u201d and can still legally row is Y.  Therefore Y must row this remaining F-trip.\n\nThus the totals are  \nW : 1\u2003\u2002X : 1\u2003\u2002Z : 1\u2003\u2002Y : 2.\n\nStep 5.

During the night each islander may quietly step aboard and tell the captain an eye-colour. If correct, he sails away and is not present the next morning. Everyone can count how many people are missing the next dawn. Therefore the fact \u201cno one left last night\u201d (or \u201cexactly N people left\u201d) is common knowledge every succeeding morning.\n\nStep 0: Why the guru\u2019s single sentence matters  \nBefore the guru speaks, each islander certainly sees many blue eyes (100 of them, or 99 if he himself is blue). But it is not common knowledge that at least one blue eye exists: an individual cannot rule out the (logically consistent) possibility that every eye he sees is brown and that he himself is the lone blue eye\u2014so perhaps nobody else sees any blue at all.  \nThe statement\n\n    \u201cI see a person with blue eyes.\u201d\n\nis made publicly by an always-truthful being. After it is uttered, the fact\n\n    (\u2203 x)(x has blue eyes)\n\nbecomes common knowledge. That is the crucial new ingredient that starts the inductive chain.\n\nThe induction, worked out completely\n\nBase case: k = 1  \nSuppose there is exactly one blue-eyed person, call him P.  \n\u2022 P looks around and sees 0 blue eyes.  \n\u2022 Everyone else (all brown-eyed) sees 1 blue eye (P).  \nWhen the guru says \u201cI see a person with blue eyes,\u201d P reasons:\n\n    \u201cIf my eyes were not blue, then nobody would have blue eyes at all.\n     Then the guru\u2019s statement would still be true (she sees no blue,\n     therefore her statement would be false!), but crucially every other\n     islander would see 0 blue eyes and would immediately know that he\n     himself must be the blue one. Because I see no blue eyes, that\n     hypothetical person cannot exist. Therefore I myself must be blue.\u201d\n\nSo P is absolutely certain of his own colour and leaves on the very first night.  \nEveryone else sees him leave and is unsurprised.\n\nConclusion for k = 1: the unique blue-eyed islander leaves on night 1.\n\nInductive hypothesis  \nAssume that for some integer k \u2265 1 the following is true:\n\n    If exactly k islanders have blue eyes, then all and only those k\n    blue-eyed islanders leave together on the k-th night, and nobody\n    leaves before.\n\nInductive step: prove the statement for k+1 blue-eyed islanders  \nNow place k+1 blue-eyed people on the island. Pick one of them, call her Q.  \n\u2022 Q sees k other blue eyes.  \n\u2022 Every brown-eyed person also sees k+1 blue eyes.  \n\u2022 Each of the other k blue-eyed people is in the symmetric position of Q.\n\nLogical reasoning carried out by Q (and similarly by every blue-eyed person):\n\n1. \u201cSuppose my own eyes are brown. Then there are exactly k blue-eyed people (the ones I see).  \n2. By the inductive hypothesis, those k people would all leave on night k.  \n3. Therefore, if nobody leaves on night k, my supposition must be wrong, and my eyes cannot be brown; they must be blue.\u201d\n\nWhat actually happens?  \n\u2022 Night 1, 2, \u2026, k: nobody leaves. (Every one of the k+1 blue-eyed people is waiting to see whether the \u2018k\u2019 case will occur.)  \n\u2022 Dawn of day k+1: everyone sees that nobody left.

Suppose the highest safe floor is F (0 \u2264 F \u2264 100).  \n    With only one ball left the only possible strategy is to start\n    at the lowest floor that is still in doubt and go up\n    one floor at a time until the ball breaks (or until you reach\n    the top).  \n    Therefore, after the first ball breaks you may have to make as many\n    further drops as the number of floors that were skipped since the\n    previous test.\n\n2.  Let T be the largest number of drops we are willing to make in the\n    worst case.  \n    Plan the first-ball drops so that, no matter where it breaks,\n    the number of \u201cskipped\u201d floors that are left to check with the second\n    ball is at most the number of drops that are still available.\n\n    \u2022 First drop: choose a floor so that, should the ball break, you\n      would still have at most T\u20131 drops left to finish the job.\n      So the first gap must be T.\n\n    \u2022 Second drop (if the first ball survived): choose the next floor so\n      that, if it now breaks, the number of floors left to check with the\n      second ball is at most T\u20132; hence the second gap must be T\u20131.\n\n    \u2022 Continue in the same way, letting the gaps shrink by 1 each time.\n      The k-th drop of the first ball is therefore made after a further\n      gap of T\u2013k+1 floors.\n\n    The sum of all these gaps must cover the whole building:\n\n            T + (T\u20131) + (T\u20132) + \u2026 + 1  \u2265  100\n            T(T+1)/2                   \u2265  100.\n\n    The smallest integer T satisfying this is 14, because\n\n            13\u00b714/2 = 91  < 100\n            14\u00b715/2 = 105 \u2265 100.\n\n    Hence no strategy can guarantee success with fewer than 14 drops,\n    and a strategy that always succeeds in 14 drops is optimal.\n\n3.

How the procedure works\n\n    \u2022 Drop the first ball from floor 14.  \n      \u2013 If it breaks, you have 13 drops left and at most 13 lower floors\n        (1\u201313) to check sequentially with the second ball.\n\n    \u2022 Otherwise go to floor 27.  \n      \u2013 If it breaks here you have used 2 drops; 12 drops remain and\n        there are exactly 12 floors (15\u201326) still in doubt, and so on.\n\n    \u2022 Continue up the listed floors until the first time the first ball\n      breaks or until you have reached floor 100 without breaking it.\n      In every possible case the total number of drops (first ball so\n      far + second-ball linear search) is never more than 14.\n\nThus 14 is the minimum worst-case number of drops, and one optimal\nsequence of floors to drop from is\n\n14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100\n(stopping as soon as the first ball breaks).\n\nFinal answer: Drop first from floor 14; if it survives, go to 27; then 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, and finally 100\u2014always stopping when the first ball breaks and then using the second ball to search sequentially upward.

Split into five \u201csub-groups\u201d.  \n    Put the horses into five groups of five and run the five races  \n\n        Race 1 :  A1  A2  A3  A4  A5  \n        Race 2 :  B1  B2  B3  B4  B5  \n        Race 3 :  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  \n        Race 4 :  D1  D2  D3  D4  D5  \n        Race 5 :  E1  E2  E3  E4  E5  \n\n    In each list the horses are written in the order they finished, so\n    A1 is fastest in group A, A2 second fastest in that group, etc.\n\n    After these five races we know the entire ordering inside every group.\n\n2.  Race the five group winners.  \n    Race 6 pits A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1 against one another.  \n    Suppose they finish\n\n        Race 6 :  A1  B1  C1  D1  E1 .\n\n    That gives us much information:\n\n       \u2022  A1 is faster than everyone else in every group.  \n       \u2022  Any horse in group D or E is beaten by at least A1, B1 and C1,   \n          so no horse from D or E can be among the overall top three.  \n       \u2022  Within group C, C2 and C3 are beaten by C1 and therefore by A1 and B1,\n          so they also cannot enter the overall top three.  \n       \u2022  In group B, only B1 and B2 can still hope to be in the overall top three.  \n       \u2022  In group A, besides the winner A1, the horses A2 and A3 are still\n          possible candidates.\n\n    Summarising, the only horses that could still be in the best three are  \n\n        A1,  A2,  A3,  B1,  B2,  C1   ( six horses in all ).\n\n3.  Final deciding race.  \n    We no longer need to race A1 (he already beat everyone once and therefore\n    is certainly in the top three).  We must decide which two out of the remaining\n    five horses join him, so we run\n\n        Race 7 :  A2   A3   B1   B2   C1 .\n\n    The order in which those five finish now completely settles places 2 and 3,\n    because every one of those five has already been beaten by A1.\n\n    For example, if Race 7\u2019s order were B1 \u2013 A2 \u2013 B2 \u2013 A3 \u2013 C1, the overall\n    ranking of the fastest three horses would be  \n\n        1st  A1,   2nd  B1,   3rd  A2.\n\n    Whatever the outcome, after this seventh race we know exactly which\n    three horses are the quickest.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nWhy 7 races are really necessary\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nCould it be done in only six races?  No, and here is a short argument.\n\nAfter the first five races you have only compared horses within their own\ngroups; none of the 2nd- or 3rd-place horses have met any outsiders.\nNo matter what you do for a single sixth race you can compare at most\nfive horses, leaving at least four of the potential candidates for the\ntop three still untested against one another.  With only six races total\nthere would always remain a pair of horses whose mutual order is unknown\nyet either of which could be third fastest overall, so you could not be sure.\nHence at least seven races are required, and we have shown seven are\nsufficient.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nLeast possible number of races\n-------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer: 7", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 170, "completion_tokens": 2486, "total_tokens": 2656, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1536, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

That is $50 000 LESS than Company A\u2019s\n       price.  \n\n   c)  Pay me $1 000 000 if I finish on time and the bridge meets every\n       specification to your complete satisfaction.  \n\n   The choice of a), b) or c) is entirely yours and is to be made only\n   after you have inspected the work.\u201d\n\n3.  Why the offer was irresistible to the Emperor  \n\n\u2022  Worst-case cost \u2013 $1 000 000 \u2013 is only $200 000 more than the price he\n  was already willing to pay to Company A, and he reaches that worst case\n  only if he first pays $200 000 to B and then still has to let A build\n  for $800 000.  \n\n\u2022  Possible saving \u2013 he might pay only $750 000 if the bridge is usable\n  but not perfect.  That is $50 000 cheaper than A\u2019s bid.  \n\n\u2022  Absolute control \u2013 the Emperor himself would decide which figure to\n  pay, after seeing the finished work (or after dismissing B early).  \n\nFrom a simple accounting view the contract strictly dominates the offer\nof Company A: equal or smaller expenditure in every unfavourable\nsituation and a chance of spending less.\n\n4.  The r\u00f4le of Company A in the plan  \n\nCompany A serves as the Emperor\u2019s guaranteed fall-back: if the Emperor\nopts for choice (a) he fires B, keeps the partly finished material, and\nhands the project to A for its original $800 000 price.  This possibility\nis what limits the Emperor\u2019s maximum exposure to $1 000 000 and makes the\ndeal attractive.\n\n5.  How Company B ended up receiving the full $1 000 000  \n\nCompany B was confident in its ability.  It finished the bridge on time,\nexactly to the Emperor\u2019s specifications, and the Emperor, having promised\nto choose price (c) under those circumstances, honestly paid the\n$1 000 000.  Company B neither lied, cheated, nor swindled; the Emperor\npaid the highest amount purely because that was the option he himself had\nselected in advance for a perfect job.\n\nFinal answer: Company B let the Emperor choose the price AFTER seeing the\nresults\u2014$200 000 if he quit early (after which the Emperor could hire\nCompany A for $800 000), $750 000 for an acceptable but not perfect\nbridge, or $1 000 000 for an on-time, perfect bridge.  The proposal could\nonly save the Emperor money or, in the worst case, cost merely $200 000\nmore than Company A\u2019s bid, so he accepted it.

But the symbol \u201c+\u201d need not always refer to that particular operation.  \n    \u2022  If we are working with vectors (directed line-segments) it is natural to let \u201c+\u201d mean vector addition: put the tail of the second vector at the head of the first and draw the resulting diagonal.  \n\n3.  Take a vector of length 3 units pointing, say, due east.  \n    \u2022  Call it v\u2081.  \n    Take a vector of length 4 units pointing due north.  \n    \u2022  Call it v\u2082.  \n    These two vectors are perpendicular.  \n\n4.

Limiting the size of the Parlor\n\nFrom (5)\u2003T_M = T_D + K\u209c = T_D + P\u209c.  \nSince no artist total exceeds 6,\u2003T_M \u2264 6 gives\u2003T_D + P\u209c \u2264 6.  \nFurther, from (4) the two Degas prints are not in the Parlor (otherwise P\u209c could not exceed the total of that same room), so the 2-Degas room must be the Dining-room.  \nThus T_D = 2 + P_D (P_D is Degas in the Parlor, which cannot equal 2).  \nAgain using T_M \u2264 6 one gets\u2003P_D + P\u209c + 2 \u2264 6 \u21d2 P_D + P\u209c \u2264 4.\n\nBecause every room has at least two prints, P\u209c is 2, 3, or 4.  \nIf P\u209c were 2 or 3 the Dining-room, already containing the two Degas prints plus at least one Pissarro, would tie or exceed P\u209c, contradicting clause (4).  \nTherefore\u2003P\u209c = K\u209c = 4.\n\nWith P\u209c = 4, P_D must be 0 (it cannot be 1,3,4 and still satisfy P_D + P\u209c \u2264 4).  \nHence T_D = 2.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.

From A, B, C\u2019s point of view there are eight possible\ntriples of colours:\n\n\u2003BBB\u2003 BBW\u2003 BWB\u2003 BWW\u2003 WBB\u2003 WBW\u2003 WWB\u2003 WWW.\n\nWhatever predetermined strategy is chosen, each player\u2019s guess depends\nonly on the two colours he can see, not on his own colour.  Write\n\n\u2003gXY = the colour a player announces when he sees the other two colours\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003in the order X,Y (X,Y \u2208 {B,W}).\n\nBecause the two colours he sees can be BB, BW, WB or WW, there are only four\nvalues gBB, gBW, gWB, gWW for each player.\n\n1.  Look at the uniform colourings BBB and WWW.  \n    To have at least two correct guesses in BBB we must have gBB = B for\n    every player (otherwise nobody wearing B could be correct).  \n    Similarly WWW forces gWW = W for every player.\n\n2.  Now examine the colouring BWW.  \n    Player A sees WW and therefore says gWW = W, yet his own colour is B, so\n    A is wrong.  To reach the demanded two correct guesses, both B and C have\n    to be right, hence\n\n\u2003\u2003gWB = B\u2003and\u2003gWW = W\u2003\u2003(for Players B and C respectively).\n\n3.  Next look at WBW.  By a symmetric argument we would need\n\n\u2003\u2003gBW = B\u2003and\u2003gWB = B.\n\n4.  Finally consider BWB.  \n    Player B now sees WB, so he says gWB = B while wearing W \u2013 B is wrong.  \n    Player C sees BW and says gBW = B while wearing B \u2013 C is right.  \n    Player A sees BB (both B and C) and says gBB = B while wearing B \u2013 A is\n    right.  Good: we still have two correct guesses \u2026 or do we?\n\n    But we already fixed gWB = B and gBW = B in the earlier steps, so when\n    the triple is WBW instead of BWB the two \u201cguaranteed\u2019\u2019 correct guesses\n    become impossible:\n\n\u2003\u2003WBW gives exactly the same three speeches as BWB,\n\u2003\u2003yet in WBW the hats are W B W,\n\u2003\u2003so only the middle player is correct, i.e. at most one correct guess.\n\nHence no strategy can ensure two correct guesses even for three people,\nlet alone for 500.  Therefore one correct guess is the absolute maximum\nthat can be guaranteed.\n\nStep 4 \u2013  Conclusion  \nThe modulo-500 rule described in Step 2 always produces at least one\ncorrect shout, and Step 3 proves that no strategy can force two correct\nshouts.

Moe\u2019s statement  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter hearing (1) Moe says:  \n\u201cIn that case, I know that all three of our numbers are different.\u201d\n\nFor Moe to deduce that, the two kinds of \u201cties\u201d that are still\npossible after (1) must both be impossible for his own number O.\n\n(a) Could M = O ?  \n\u2003Then 2O + J = 14\u2003\u21d2\u2003J = 14 \u2013 2O > 0.  \n\u2003This is possible exactly when O \u2264 6.  \n\u2003So if O \u2264 6 Moe could not rule out M = O.  \n\u2003Hence O \u2265 7.                                                 (2)\n\n(b) Could M = J ?  \n\u2003Write J = M.  Then                        2M + O = 14  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u21d2\u2003M = (14 \u2013 O)/2 .  \n\u2003For M to be odd, (14 \u2013 O)/2 must be an odd integer.  \n\u2003Compute (14 \u2013 O)/2 for O = 1,2,\u2026  \n\n\u2003\u2003O : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  \n\u2003\u2003(14\u2013O)/2 : 6\u00bd 6 5\u00bd 5 4\u00bd 4 3\u00bd 3 2\u00bd 2 1\u00bd 1  \n\nOdd integers occur for O = 4, 8, 12.  \nSo if O were 4, 8, or 12, Moe would have to admit the\npossibility M = J.  \nHence O \u2209 {4,8,12}.                                  (3)\n\nCombine (2) and (3):  \n\n\u2003O \u2208 {9,10,11}.                                      (4)\n\nAll Moe can tell now is that the numbers are different, but he does\nnot yet know their exact values.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Determining the possibilities for each O in (4)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nBecause M is odd and J \u2260 O, list all triples (M,O,J):\n\nO = 9 :\u2003M + J = 5 with M odd.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 (M,J) = (1,4) or (3,2).\n\nO = 10 :\u2003M + J = 4 with M odd.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 (M,J) = (1,3).\n\nO = 11 :\u2003M + J = 3 with M odd.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 (M,J) = (1,2).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  Jack\u2019s statement  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nJack now says he knows all three numbers.  \nThat can happen only if, among the triples compatible with the\nprevious conversation, there is exactly one having his own J.\n\nList J\u2013values in the table above:\n\n\u2003J = 4 appears once\u2003\u2192\u2003(1,9,4)  \n\u2003J = 2 appears twice\u2003\u2192\u2003(3,9,2)\u2003or\u2003(1,11,2)  \n\u2003J = 3 appears once\u2003\u2192\u2003(1,10,3)\n\nIf Jack were holding 2, two different triples would still be\npossible, so he could not be certain.  \nTherefore J \u2260 2.\n\nIf Jack were holding 3, he would still have to decide between\nM = 1 with O = 10 or M = ?  But there is only the one possibility\n(1,10,3); nevertheless we must also check consistency with Moe\u2019s\nability in step 2.  For O = 10, we already know Moe could say the\nnumbers are all different.  So Jack with J = 3 would *not* face\nany ambiguity; however, the class outside the triangle would still\nhave two possible triples left, because they do not know which J\nJack saw.  The puzzle tells us that a *member of the class*\n(Gretchen) can now solve it uniquely, so the only J that leaves a\nsingle triple for *everyone* is J = 4.\n\nHence J = 4 and the only compatible triple is\n\n\u2003(M,O,J) = (1,9,4).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n5.  Gretchen\u2019s answer  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nThus Gretchen announces:\n\n\u2003Manny has\u20031,\u2003Moe has\u20039,\u2003Jack has\u20034.\n\nOne easily verifies that all the remarks in the story are satisfied\nby these numbers.\n\nFinal answer: Manny \u2013 1, Moe \u2013 9, Jack \u2013 4", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 305, "completion_tokens": 5725, "total_tokens": 6030, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 4608, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

From clue 1:\n        messages(Thursday)  >  messages(Bedroom-day)  <  messages(Tuesday).\n\n   And from clue 3:\n        messages(Bedroom-day)  >  messages(Den-day) (= Friday).\n\n   Combining these we have the strict order\n        messages(Tuesday)  >  messages(Thursday)  >  messages(Bedroom-day)  >  messages(Friday).\n\n4. Bedroom cannot be Wed (Kitchen), Thu (Bathroom) or Fri (Den), so Bedroom is Monday or Tuesday.  \n   But Tuesday\u2019s message total is the highest (see the chain above), so Bedroom cannot be Tuesday.  \n   Hence\n\n        Monday: Bedroom.\n\n5. The numbers 1\u20135 must be distributed with 1 already on Wednesday.  \n   Let the remaining numbers be assigned to (Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri).  \n   To respect the ordering found in step 3, the only way is\n\n        Tuesday   5  \n        Thursday  4  \n        Monday    3  \n        Friday    2\n\n6.

Precise statement of the sub-problem  \n   Let f(n) be the truth\u2013value of the sentence  \n   \u201cWith n lions and one sheep on the island, the original sheep will finally be eaten.\u201d  \n   The only thing that decides f(n) is the number n, because every lion thinks exactly like every other lion and all of them can see the whole future of the game.\n\n2.  Base cases  \n\n   \u2022 n = 0\u2003(trivial but useful)  \n     There is no lion.  The sheep is obviously safe.  So f(0) = false.  \n\n   \u2022 n = 1  \n     One lion can eat the sheep and then will be a sheep himself, surrounded by zero lions.  \n     From the result f(0)=false he knows nobody can then eat him.  \n     He strictly prefers \u201ceat a sheep and survive\u201d to \u201ceat grass forever\u201d,  \n     so he eats.  Hence f(1) = true.  \n\n   \u2022 n = 2  \n     Suppose one of the two lions considers eating.  After doing so he turns into a sheep; the world would then have 1 lion and 1 sheep.  \n     From the previous paragraph the new sheep knows f(1)=true, i.e. with one lion around the sheep gets eaten.  Therefore the prospective eater foresees that, the moment he becomes a sheep, the other lion will surely devour him.  Being rational, he refuses to eat.  The same argument holds for the other lion, hence nobody eats.  Therefore f(2) = false.\n\n3.  Inductive step  \n\n   Assume we already know the value of f(k) for every k \u2264 n.  Consider the situation with n+1 lions.\n\n   \u2022 If n+1 is odd  \n     Any lion can think: \u201cIf I eat the sheep, I become a sheep and there will remain n lions.  By the induction hypothesis, f(n) is false whenever n is even.\u201d  \n     Since n = (n+1)\u22121 is even, the new sheep would be safe.  \n     Safe and having enjoyed a meal is strictly better than eating grass, so one lion will indeed eat.  \n     Therefore f(n+1)=true whenever n+1 is odd.\n\n   \u2022 If n+1 is even  \n     A lion contemplating the same act foresees that after eating, n lions remain, where n is odd.  \n     By the inductive hypothesis f(n)=true for odd n, meaning the new sheep would certainly be eaten.  \n     Because \u201cbeing eaten\u201d is worse than \u201ceating grass\u201d, no lion will take the risk.  \n     Hence f(n+1)=false whenever n+1 is even.\n\n4.  Conclusion of the induction  \n\n   We have shown\n        f(n) = true   if n is odd\n        f(n) = false  if n is even.\n\n5.

The hint tells us that Martha is a grandparent (G).  \n    So G = {Martha , \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad?}.\n\n2.  Clue 5 : \u201cJustin married Mary.\u201d  \n    Married couples occur only in generations G (the two grandparents) and P (the two parental couples).  \n    Because one grandparent spot is already Martha, Justin and Mary must be one of the two parental couples in generation P.\n\n3.  Clue 2 : \u201cJohn\u2019s sister gave birth to Tina.\u201d  \n    Since Tina is a grandchild (C), John and his sister must be the two blood children in generation P.  \n    Therefore the two blood children of the grandparents are  \n        John and (John\u2019s sister).  \n\n4.  Combine with 2.: John\u2019s sister is Mary.  \n    Hence the parental couples are  \n        (Justin , Mary)   and   (John , ?).\n\n5.  Clue 3 : \u201cMary went bowling with her nephew.\u201d  \n    Mary can have a nephew only if her brother John has children.  \n    Thus the couple (John , ?) indeed has two children, both grandchildren.\n\n6.  Clue 7 : \u201cLincoln\u2019s brother showed Justin\u2019s son his baseball cards.\u201d  \n    Justin\u2019s son is a child of (Justin , Mary).  \n    Lincoln and his brother are siblings, so they are the two children of the other parental couple (John , ?).  \n    Consequently Lincoln is John\u2019s son, and John\u2019s other child (his brother) is another boy.\n\n7.  Clue 4 : \u201cAlex is cousins with one of the girls.\u201d  \n    The girls among the grandchildren are Tina and (possibly) someone else, but we already know Tina is in the family (Justin , Mary).  \n    Therefore Alex must be the other son of John; that makes Alex a cousin of Tina.  \n    Now John\u2019s two children are (Lincoln , Alex).\n\n8.  Clue 6 : \u201cJessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.\u201d  \n    Jessica cannot be a grandparent (G) nor one of the grandchildren (C).  \n    The only remaining place that is neither ancestor nor cousin of Tina is the role of John\u2019s wife (Tina\u2019s aunt).  \n    Hence John\u2019s wife is Jessica.\n\n9.  We have now accounted for every name except David and Jamie.  \n    Clue 1 : \u201cOne of Jamie\u2019s ancestors was David.\u201d  \n    If David is placed as the second grandparent, every grandchild will indeed have David as an ancestor.  \n    So let David be Martha\u2019s husband, the second grandparent.  \n    The only unassigned grandchild name left is Jamie, so Jamie is the son of (Justin , Mary).  \n    (This also satisfies Clue 7: Justin\u2019s son = Jamie.)\n\nAll names are now placed:\n\nGeneration 1 (grandparents)  \n    David  \u2500\u2500 Martha  \n\nGeneration 2 (their children & spouses)  \n    John  \u2500\u2500 Jessica  \n    Mary  \u2500\u2500 Justin  \n\nGeneration 3 (grandchildren)  \n    John & Jessica\u2019s children : Lincoln , Alex  \n    Mary & Justin\u2019s children : Tina , Jamie  \n\nVerification of every clue  \n\u2022 Jamie\u2019s ancestor David \u2192 David is Jamie\u2019s grandfather.  \n\u2022 John\u2019s sister (Mary) gave birth to Tina \u2192 true.  \n\u2022 Mary\u2019s nephew \u2192 either Lincoln or Alex \u2192 true.  \n\u2022 Alex is cousin of the girl Tina \u2192 true.  \n\u2022 Justin married Mary \u2192 true.  \n\u2022 Jessica is neither ancestor nor cousin of Tina (she is an aunt) \u2192 true.  \n\u2022 Lincoln\u2019s brother (Alex) showed Justin\u2019s son (Jamie) his baseball cards \u2192 true.\n\nAll conditions are met.\n\nFinal answer:  \nGrandparents: David and Martha.  \nTheir two children: John and Mary.  \nJohn married Jessica and had two sons, Lincoln and Alex.  \nMary married Justin and had two children, Tina (daughter) and Jamie (son).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 301, "completion_tokens": 7641, "total_tokens": 7942, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 6720, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

The five RBI totals (0,1,2,3,4) are all different, and the five error totals are 0, 1, 2, 2, 3 (the only way to satisfy \u201cexactly two players had the same number of errors, either 1 or 2,\u201d together with the later clues).\n\n2.  From the clues:\n    \u2022  LF had 1 RBI.  \n    \u2022  Jimmy Blake had 2 RBIs.  \n    \u2022  Tim had either 2 or 3 RBIs \u2013 since 2 is already Jimmy\u2019s, Tim must have 3 RBIs.  \n    \u2022  Flynn had exactly 1 error.  \n    \u2022  \u201cNo one has the same number of RBIs and errors,\u201d so Flynn cannot have 1 RBI.  \n    \u2022  The player with 0 RBIs made 2 errors and is not the 3-baseman.  \n    \u2022  K.C. made two fewer errors than the catcher \u21d2 catcher\u2019s errors = K.C.\u2019s errors + 2.\n\n3.  Let the duplicate error be \u201c2\u201d.\n    \u2022  Then the set of errors is 0, 1, 2, 2, 3 and we already have Flynn = 1 error.\n    \u2022  For K.C. the only value that lets catcher\u2019s errors stay \u22643 is K.C. = 0 error, making catcher = 2 errors.\n      Thus K.C. = 0 error, catcher = 2 errors.\n    \u2022  So the two players with 2 errors will be the catcher and one other player.\n\n4.  The 0-RBI/2-error player (not at 3B) must therefore be the catcher.  \n    Hence Hank (not named yet) is the catcher with 0 RBIs and 2 errors.\n\n5.  K.C. now has 0 errors and therefore cannot have 0 RBIs (numbers must differ); the still-unused RBI 1 must go to K.C.  Because LF alone has 1 RBI, K.C. is the left-fielder.\n\n6.  RBIs now used: 0 (Hank), 1 (K.C.), 2 (Jimmy), 3 (Tim).  The remaining RBI 4 goes to Flynn (whose 1 error is different from 4 RBIs).\n\n7.  Tim\u2019s error total is one more than the pitcher\u2019s.  Since only the values 2 and 3 remain unused in the error list and two players already have 2 errors (Hank and \u201csomeone\u201d), Tim must be that \u201csomeone\u201d: Tim = 2 errors, pitcher = 1 error.

How many dads does each child have?  \n    \u2022  The narrator has three: his own biological father (Husband #2) plus the two men who have been, at different times, married to his mother (Husbands #1 and #3).  \n    \u2022  The two oldest sisters have only two dads \u2013 their biological father (Husband #1) and their present step-father (Husband #3).  \n    \u2022  The two youngest sisters, like the narrator, still see all three men as dads.\n\nEverything in the riddle is now explained:\n\n\u2013 \u201cI have 3 dads\u201d  \u2192 biological dad + former step-dad + present step-dad.  \n\u2013 \u201c4 sisters\u201d       \u2192 the other four children.  \n\u2013 \u201cMy immediate family \u2026 consists of 7\u201d  \u2192 step-dad #3, the narrator, four sisters, and the nephew.  \n\u2013 \u201cTwo of my sisters only have 2 dads\u201d  \u2192 the two oldest girls missed out on one of the step-dads.  \n\u2013 \u201cMy nephew lives with me and I\u2019m the middle child\u201d  \u2192 Daughter 1\u2019s little boy lives in the same house and the narrator is the third of the five children.\n\nFinal answer: it is an ordinary blended family produced by three successive marriages of the same mother; the narrator has his biological father and two step-fathers, two of the sisters missed one of those step-fathers and therefore have only two dads, and the seven people actually sharing the house are the current step-dad, the narrator, the four sisters, and the eldest sister\u2019s little boy (the nephew).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 131, "completion_tokens": 9930, "total_tokens": 10061, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 9280, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

The \u201cleap-frog\u201d walkway  \n   \u2022 Carlo begins just inside the door, places Plank A on the carpet perpendicular to the wires.  \n   \u2022 He steps onto its near end.  \n   \u2022 He now reaches forward and puts Plank B on the carpet, again perpendicular to the wires and overlapping the first plank a little.  \n   \u2022 He walks onto Plank B, picks up Plank A, moves it ahead of Plank B, and so on.  \n   \u2022 In this leap-frog manner he advances the 7.5 m from the doorway to the pedestal in the centre of the 15 m room.  \n   \u2022 At every stage his weight is on one plank only, and that plank is always resting on at least 31 wires, so no single wire is loaded with more than 4 kg.\n\n5. What the other items are for  \n   \u2022 If he wants additional safety he can pass one of the 2-m leather straps forward first; a strap laid cross-wise spans  \n         2 m \u00f7 0.08 m \u2248 25 wires  \n     and carries only 74 kg \u00f7 25 \u2248 3 kg per wire.  The strap can serve as a temporary bridge while he rearranges a plank.  \n   \u2022 The hammer is used at the end to break the glass cube, and the remaining straps let him tie the diamond to his body for the trip back.  \n\n6.

Each plank rests on about 31 wires, so no wire bears more than about 2.4 kg of his 74 kg weight.
