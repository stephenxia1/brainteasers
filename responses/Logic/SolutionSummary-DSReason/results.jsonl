{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm\" said the wrestler.\nThe swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

{"ID": 1, "Question": "Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, \"You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.\n\"In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.\n\"After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.\"\n\"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.\"\n\"But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'\n\"If it is true, then you will all be set free.

Appoint a \"scorekeeper\" and the other 22 prisoners as \"transmitters\".\n2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.

The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.\n3.

{"ID": 4, "Question": "Question: Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Solution: 199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.

No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.

If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.

Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?\n Solution: First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)\n17th is 8 or 24.\nOn the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)\n17th is 24 and Cutbank.\nMad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).\nWith one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)\nHe fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.\nHumpback is 21st. (2)\nMad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)\nHumpback is Big Little Falls.\nThe deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)\nFirst day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.\n15th then is Bottle.\nMad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).\nMouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.\nDolly is 14th or 15th.\nMad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)\nMayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.\nStonefly is 15th.\nMad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.\nAt least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)\nStonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.\nMad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)\nOnly wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nElk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.\nParachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.\nHis shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nBrookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.\nThe fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)\nAdams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.\n Solution: From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:\n_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.\nBart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.\n_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.\nPatty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.

Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Solution: Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position.

Only person #10 risks a 50% chance of being wrong, but all others survive with certainty.  \n\n**Key Insight:**  \nThe strategy leverages parity (modulo 2 arithmetic) to encode critical information in the first response. Each subsequent responder uses this shared parity and prior answers to reconstruct their own hat color, maximizing survival to **9 guaranteed survivors**.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 23, "Question": "Question: \"Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!\"  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.\n\"Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.\"  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.\nNora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  \"You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?\"\n\"Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.\"\n\"Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.\"\n\"It runs in the family,\" he smiled across two time zones.  \"Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ...\" Vic's voice trailed off.\n\"Except for one interval?\"  Corman filled in.\n\"Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.\"\nNora yelped.  \"You had *eleven*,\" then her left brain caught up, \"no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.\"\n\"De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.\"\n\"So they got it sorted out?\"\n\"Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!\"\n\"So what did they do?\"\n\"Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.\"\nHe took a cleansing breath.  \"On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?\"\n\"I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?\"\nVic broke in, \"He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.\"\nCorman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  \"Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?\"\n\"Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.\"\n\"Got it.\"  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.

The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.\n3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.\n4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.\n5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.\n6.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas.

Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth.

{"ID": 34, "Question": "Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.\n1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.\n2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.\n3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.\n4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.\n5. Bill never played Dave.\n6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.\n7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.\n8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.\n9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.\n10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.\n11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.\n12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.\n13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.\n14. In the first round, Dave didn't play the eventual champion\n Solution: RANKING/ PLAYER/ GAMES\n1st - Jamie McNeilly, 15 games\n2nd - Lottie Averson, 14 games\n3rd - Kristin Toskhaya, 9 games\n4th - Bill White, 7 games\n5th - Patrice Chang, 4 games\n6th - Regina Diaz, 3 games\n7th - Samuel Fitzroy, 2 games\n8th - Dave Gianelli, 1 game\n1st Round\nBeachcomber, Jamie, 5, Patrice, 4\nBrooklyn, Kristin, 5, Regina, 3\nEastlake, Bill, 5, Samuel, 2\nSouthville, Lottie, 5, Dave, 1\n2nd Round\nIslip, Jamie, 5, Bill, 2\nUncle Phil's, Lottie, 5, Kristin, 4\n3rd Round\nN. Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.", "Hint": "Last names: Averson, Chang, Diaz, Fitzroy, Gianelli, McNeilly, Toskhaya and White", "Human Solution": "RANKING/ PLAYER/ GAMES\n1st - Jamie McNeilly, 15 games\n2nd - Lottie Averson, 14 games\n3rd - Kristin Toskhaya, 9 games\n4th - Bill White, 7 games\n5th - Patrice Chang, 4 games\n6th - Regina Diaz, 3 games\n7th - Samuel Fitzroy, 2 games\n8th - Dave Gianelli, 1 game\n1st Round\nBeachcomber, Jamie, 5, Patrice, 4\nBrooklyn, Kristin, 5, Regina, 3\nEastlake, Bill, 5, Samuel, 2\nSouthville, Lottie, 5, Dave, 1\n2nd Round\nIslip, Jamie, 5, Bill, 2\nUncle Phil's, Lottie, 5, Kristin, 4\n3rd Round\nN.

Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1).

Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:\n\"I see a person with blue eyes.\"\nWho leaves the island? And when do they leave?\n Solution: All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island.

Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

Here's how to do it:\nFirst drop the first ball from the 14th floor.

If the first ball survives 99, the next would be 103 (invalid). For floor 99, if the first ball breaks there, the second ball tests 96\u201398 (3 drops). Total drops: \\( 11 + 3 = 14 \\).  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe optimal strategy involves dropping the first ball from floors 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99. If it breaks, use the second ball to test sequentially from the last safe floor +1. This guarantees a maximum of **14 drops** to determine the critical floor.", "Status": true}

When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)\n Solution: It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf.

Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast.

Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem.

This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or have a diagonal distance where the row and column differences are equal.\n\n2. **Row-by-Row Placement:** Since there are 8 rows and 8 queens, place one queen per row. This reduces the problem to selecting a unique column for each row (i.e., a permutation of columns 1\u20138).\n\n3. **Check Column Conflicts:** For each new queen, ensure its column is not already occupied by a previously placed queen.\n\n4. **Check Diagonal Conflicts:** For a queen placed at position \\((r, c)\\), ensure no other queen at \\((r', c')\\) satisfies \\(|r - r'| = |c - c'|\\). This eliminates diagonal threats.\n\n5. **Backtracking Method:** Systematically place queens row by row. If a conflict arises, backtrack to the previous row and try the next valid column. Repeat until all queens are placed without conflicts.\n\n6. **Example Solution Construction:**  \n   - **Row 1:** Place queen at \\(a1\\) (column 1).  \n   - **Row 2:** Avoid columns 1 and 2 (blocked by \\(a1\\) diagonally). Place at \\(g2\\) (column 7).  \n   - **Row 3:** Avoid columns 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 (blocked diagonally/vertically). Place at \\(e3\\) (column 5).  \n   - **Row 4:** Avoid columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place at \\(h4\\) (column 8).  \n   - **Row 5:** Avoid columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. Place at \\(b5\\) (column 2).  \n   - **Row 6:** Avoid columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place at \\(d6\\) (column 4).  \n   - **Row 7:** Avoid columns 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place at \\(f7\\) (column 6).  \n   - **Row 8:** Only remaining column is \\(c8\\) (column 3), which is safe.  \n\n7. **Verification:** Confirm no two queens share a row, column, or diagonal. For example, \\(a1\\) and \\(g2\\) differ by 1 row and 6 columns, so \\(|1-2| \\neq |1-7|\\), satisfying the diagonal constraint.\n\n**ANSWER:**  \nOne valid arrangement is placing queens at **a1, g2, e3, h4, b5, d6, f7, c8** (as in the first example solution). This ensures no two queens threaten each other by sharing a row, column, or diagonal.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 57, "Question": "Question: There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.

Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.

If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full \u00be pay for \u00be of a bridge ($750,000).\nWhen Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.

{"ID": 63, "Question": "Question: The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:\n[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.\n[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.\n[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.\n[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.\n[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.\nThe Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).\nBased on this information, which of these statements is accurate?\n1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.\n2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.\n3. The World Series winner is uncertain.\nThe bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.\n Solution: The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.\n[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored.

Use the third question to force a definitive answer from the remaining candidate, resolving all ambiguities.", "Status": true}

But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.\nThe Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?\n Solution: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

For example:\n     - Row 1 (640) requires contributions like 400 (4\u00d7100) + 200 (2\u00d7100) + 30 (3\u00d710) + 10 (1\u00d710).\n     - Column D (550) requires values like 400 (4\u00d7100) + 100 (1\u00d7100) + 40 (4\u00d710) + 10 (1\u00d710).\n\n3. **Assign Large Values First:**\n   - Place 100s in cells to satisfy high totals while adhering to the Latin square. For example:\n     - Row 1 uses 400 (4\u00d7100) and 200 (2\u00d7100).\n     - Row 4 uses 400 (4\u00d7100) in Column D.\n\n4. **Maintain the Latin Square Structure:**\n   - Ensure no duplicate numbers in rows/columns. For instance:\n     - If 4 is placed in Row 1 (as 400), it cannot reappear in the same row or column until allowed by the Latin square.\n\n5. **Adjust Smaller Values to Match Totals:**\n   - Use smaller scaled values (1s, 10s) to fill gaps. For example:\n     - Row 3 (total 55) uses 4, 1, 30 (3\u00d710), and 20 (2\u00d710) to sum to 55.\n     - Column A (total 316) combines 10 (1\u00d710), 300 (3\u00d7100), 4 (4\u00d71), and 2 (2\u00d71).\n\n6. **Verify All Totals and Constraints:**\n   - Confirm that every row and column sums correctly and that numbers 1\u20134 appear exactly once in each row/column. For example:\n     - Row 2: 300 (3\u00d7100) + 2 (2\u00d71) + 40 (4\u00d710) + 100 (1\u00d7100) = 442.\n     - Column B: 400 (4\u00d7100) + 2 (2\u00d71) + 1 (1\u00d71) + 30 (3\u00d710) = 433.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe grid is filled with appropriately scaled values (e.g., 010, 400) to meet all row/column totals and Latin square constraints.

This aligns with ninjas lying about their own group.\n\n4. **Assess Ninja D's assertion:**\n   - D claims, \"A belongs to B's group.\" A (pirate) and B (ninja) are in different groups. \n   - D, a pirate, lies about pirates, falsely asserting A is in B's group, consistent with pirate behavior.\n\n5. **Examine Ninja E's declaration:**\n   - E, a pirate, says, \"B belongs to C's group.\" Both B and C are ninjas, making this statement true. Pirates tell the truth about ninjas, validating E's role as a pirate.\n\n6. **Verify Ninja F's statement:**\n   - F, a ninja, claims, \"E belongs to A's group.\" E and A are pirates, so the statement is true. Ninjas truthfully report about pirates, confirming F's role as a ninja.\n\n**Final Identifications:**\n- **Pirates:** Ninja A, D, E (lie about pirates, tell truth about ninjas).\n- **Ninjas:** Ninja B, C, F (lie about ninjas, tell truth about pirates). \n\nEach step ensures logical consistency with the rules governing truth-telling for ninjas and pirates.", "Status": true}

The challenge is to reconcile unequal monetary amounts with equal treatment.\n\n2. **Identifying Equality Beyond Absolute Amounts:** The key is recognizing equality in a non-monetary measure. Since Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy have different financial habits (investing, spending, squandering), their inheritances must reflect a common metric tied to their individual circumstances.\n\n3. **Linking Inheritance to Personal Salary:** Stu left each child an inheritance equal to **one year of their own annual salary**. This means:\n   - Derek, who invests wisely (likely a higher salary), receives a larger sum.\n   - Eric, who spends wildly (potentially a moderate salary), receives a moderate sum.\n   - Monkeyboy, who buys magic beans (unknown salary but distinct from the others), receives a sum based on his salary.\n\n4. **Establishing Fairness Through Proportionality:** While the absolute amounts differ, each child receives the equivalent of **one year\u2019s effort in their own financial context**. This ensures fairness by valuing their time equally, even if their earnings (and thus inheritances) vary. \n\n5. **Conclusion:** Stu treated his children equally by providing each with a proportional measure (one year\u2019s salary) rather than identical monetary amounts.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?\n Solution: The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten.

And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done.

However, the dog cannot observe whether poison exists, so the flower\u2019s decision cannot influence the dog\u2019s choice retroactively.\n\n2. **Dog\u2019s Decision-Making:**\n   - If the dog eats the flower:\n     - **Without poison:** Dog survives (100% chance).\n     - **With poison:** Dog dies (0% chance).\n   - If the dog doesn\u2019t eat the flower:\n     - Dog faces a 50% survival chance from the virus.\n   - The dog must compare these outcomes based on its knowledge of the flower\u2019s rationality.\n\n3. **Flower\u2019s Rational Choice:**\n   - Since the dog cannot observe poison, the flower\u2019s choice cannot alter the dog\u2019s action. Whether the dog eats or not, producing poison does not improve the flower\u2019s survival odds (it dies if eaten regardless). Thus, the flower optimally chooses **not to produce poison** to avoid unnecessary effort.\n\n4. **Dog\u2019s Conclusion:**\n   - The dog knows the flower is rational and will not waste effort on poison. Therefore, the dog infers the flower is **not poisonous**.\n   - Eating the flower guarantees survival (100% chance), while not eating offers only a 50% chance. The dog rationally chooses to **eat the flower**.\n\n5. **Outcome:**\n   - The flower does not produce poison, and the dog eats it, surviving with certainty. This outcome is the only Nash equilibrium, as both parties act optimally given their knowledge of each other\u2019s rationality.\n\n**ANSWER:**  \nThe dog will eat the flower. Since the flower cannot deter the dog by producing poison (as the dog cannot observe it), the flower rationally avoids making poison. The dog, knowing this, eats the flower to guarantee survival instead of risking a 50% chance of death.", "Status": true}

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Cutting is ineffective due to uneven burn rates.\n\n2. **Key Insight:** Burning a fuse from both ends halves its total burn time, regardless of irregularity. This principle applies even if the fuse burns unevenly.\n\n3. **Procedure:**\n   - **Step 1:** Light both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse simultaneously.\n   - **Step 2:** The 1-hour fuse burns out in 30 minutes (half its total time). At this moment:\n     - The 2-hour fuse has burned for 30 minutes from one end, leaving 90 minutes of unburned fuse remaining.\n   - **Step 3:** Immediately light the unburned end of the 2-hour fuse. Now, it burns from both ends, halving the remaining time: 90 minutes \u00f7 2 = 45 minutes.\n   - **Step 4:** The 2-hour fuse burns out 45 minutes after the second end is lit. This 45-minute interval (from the 30-minute mark to the 75-minute total) provides the exact measurement.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Burning both ends of the 1-hour fuse guarantees a 30-minute interval.\n   - The 2-hour fuse\u2019s remaining burn time after 30 minutes (90 minutes) is halved to 45 minutes when ignited from both ends.\n   - No reliance on cutting or uniform burn rates; only the total burn time and simultaneous ignition are critical.\n\n**Final Answer:** By burning both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse, then lighting the second end of the 2-hour fuse when the first fuse extinguishes, you measure 45 minutes.", "Status": true}

The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?\n Solution: The sheep would remain untouched.\nIn fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.\nHere's the reasoning:\nConsider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.\nYou can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.", "Hint": "There are two hints.

Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice.

{"ID": 160, "Question": "Question: Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.\nIn due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).\nThe estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.\nHow did they divide Biggie's estate?\n Solution: The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.\n(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.

{"ID": 182, "Question": "Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.\nTaking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.\nNow, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.\nWhat are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again.

{"ID": 190, "Question": "Question: A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?\n Solution: Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat.

On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...\n Solution: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?\n Solution: The high suit is diamonds.\nThe first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.\nIf the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had.

If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club.

One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.\nTorks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments.

The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.\nIn this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:\nGame 1:  4 to 3\nGame 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)\nGame 3:  11 to 7\nGame 4:  16 to 9\nGame 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)\nGame 6:  2 to 1\nGame 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)\nWhich team won the World Series?\n Solution: Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.\nThe team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.\nTherefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.

{"ID": 242, "Question": "Question: A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?\na) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.\nb) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.\nc) One of the groups contains only married couples.\nd) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.\ne) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.\n Solution: The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

{"ID": 249, "Question": "Question: Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?\n1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this\norder): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark\nchocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.\n2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one\nfrom milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.\n3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.\n4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.\n5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.\n6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.\n7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped\nchocolate is #1.\n Solution: Solution:\nPosition - Shape - Flavour\n1 - Triangular - Dark chocolate\n2 - Square - Gianduia\n3 - Rectangular - White chocolate\n4 - Oval - Milk chocolate\n5 - Flower - White chocolate-hazelnut\n6 - Rhombus - Dark chocolate-orange\n7 - Round - Cremino\n8 - Heart - Milk chocolate-cognac\n9 - Hemispherical - Dark chocolate hazelnut\n10 - Hexagonal - Tiramisu\n11 - Trapezoid - Caramel\n12 - Pentagonal - Milk chocolate-cherry", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Solution:\nPosition - Shape - Flavour\n1 - Triangular - Dark chocolate\n2 - Square - Gianduia\n3 - Rectangular - White chocolate\n4 - Oval - Milk chocolate\n5 - Flower - White chocolate-hazelnut\n6 - Rhombus - Dark chocolate-orange\n7 - Round - Cremino\n8 - Heart - Milk chocolate-cognac\n9 - Hemispherical - Dark chocolate hazelnut\n10 - Hexagonal - Tiramisu\n11 - Trapezoid - Caramel\n12 - Pentagonal - Milk chocolate-cherry", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": "**SUMMARY:**\n\n1. **Assign Position 1 (Triangular):**  \n   - Clue 7 states the triangular chocolate is #1. Assign flavor as Dark Chocolate (each row must have one dark and milk, not adjacent).\n\n2. **Determine Row 1's Milk Chocolate:**  \n   - Row 1 must include one milk chocolate. Position 4 is assigned Oval-shaped Milk Chocolate (later linked to Clue 7).\n\n3. **Clue 3 (Cremino, Heart, Trapezoid):**  \n   - Cremino (flavor) is left of Heart-shaped (Milk-Cognac) in the same row (Row 2, positions 7 and 8). Trapezoid (position 11) is directly below Cremino.\n\n4. **Clue 1's Row (Row 2):**  \n   - Row 2 contains Flower-shaped (White-Hazelnut, not Gianduia), Dark-Orange (Rhombus), Heart (Milk-Cognac), and the chocolate below White (position 7, Cremino). White in Row 1 (position 3: Rectangular).\n\n5. **Clue 4 (Hexagonal & Dark-Hazelnut):**  \n   - Hexagonal (position 10) is below Dark-Orange (position 6). Dark-Hazelnut (position 9: Hemispherical) is left of Hexagonal in Row 3.\n\n6. **Clue 5 (Caramel & Square):**  \n   - Square (position 2: Gianduia) and Caramel (position 11: Trapezoid) are in central columns (not same row/column).\n\n7. **Clue 6 (Round, Pentagonal, Gianduia):**  \n   - Gianduia (position 2) < Round (position 7: Cremino) < Pentagonal (position 12: Milk-Cherry), all in different rows.\n\n8. **Final Assignments:**  \n   - Verify all rows have one dark and milk, not adjacent.
