0,"Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.

**BONUS ANSWER:** The year is **2003** (Christmas on a Thursday).",True
1,"Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.
 Solution: 1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".

1. **Assign Roles:**  
   - Designate one prisoner as the **Scorekeeper** responsible for tracking visits.  
   - The remaining 22 prisoners act as **Transmitters**, signaling they have visited.

2. **Transmitter Protocol:**  
   - **First Visit Rule:**  
     - If Switch B is **OFF**, flip it **ON** (this is their only signal).  
     - If Switch B is **ON**, flip Switch A instead.  
   - **Subsequent Visits:**  
     - Always flip Switch A, regardless of the switches’ states (to avoid duplicate signals).  

3. **Scorekeeper Protocol:**  
   - **When Entering the Room:**  
     - If Switch B is **ON**, flip it **OFF** and **increment the count** by 1.  
     - If Switch B is **OFF**, flip Switch A (no count change).  
   - **Declaration Condition:**  
     - Once the Scorekeeper’s count reaches **22**, all Transmitters have signaled at least once. The Scorekeeper declares, ensuring freedom.

**Logical Consistency:**  
- Each Transmitter’s **first valid signal** (turning B ON) is counted exactly once by the Scorekeeper (via turning B OFF).  
- Transmitters flipping A after their first signal prevents double-counting.  
- Random selection and repeated visits are irrelevant, as the system ensures cumulative, non-overlapping counts.  
- The Scorekeeper’s own visits do not interfere with the count, as they only tally others’ signals.

The minimal number of coconuts is **3121**, derived via modular arithmetic or a ""rotten coconut"" trick to resolve divisibility constraints.",True

1. **Determine Key Constraints:**
   - **Clue 9:** \( J = 0 \) (since \( IJ \) is a multiple of 10), and \( I \) is a digit ≠ 0.
   - **Clue 10:** \( JA \) is prime, so \( A \) must be 2, 3, 5, or 7 (as \( J = 0 \), making \( JA \) a prime like 05=5).
   - **Sum Constraints:** Total digits sum to 45. \( A+B+C+D+E = 30 \) (multiple of 6), \( F+G+H+I = 15 \) (multiple of 5), \( A+C+E+G+I = 27 \) (multiple of 9), \( B+D+F+H = 18 \) (multiple of 2).

2. **Analyze FE, HC, and JA Primes:**
   - **FE:** \( EF \) must be a multiple of 7, and \( FE \) must be prime. Valid pairs: \( EF = 14 \) (FE=41), \( 35 \) (FE=53), \( 91 \) (FE=19), \( 98 \) (FE=89).
   - **HC:** \( H \) is even (from GH divisible by 8), and \( HC \) is prime. Valid pairs: 23, 29, 43, 47, 61, 67, 83, 89.
   - **JA:** \( A \) must be 2, 3, 5, or 7.

3. **AB and CD Multiples:**
   - **AB** (multiple of 3): Possible values include 57, 75, 36, 39, etc.
   - **CD** (multiple of 4): Valid pairs depend on \( C \) (e.g., \( C = 3 \Rightarrow CD = 32, 36 \); \( C = 7 \Rightarrow CD = 72, 76 \)).

4. **Assign Digits via Elimination:**
   - **EF = 91** (FE=19 prime) fixes \( E = 9 \), \( F = 1 \).
   - **HC = 43** (prime) fixes \( H = 4 \), \( C = 3 \).
   - **CD = 36** (multiple of 4) fixes \( D = 6 \).
   - **GH = 24** (multiple of 8) fixes \( G = 2 \), \( H = 4 \).
   - **AB = 57** (multiple of 3) fixes \( A = 5 \), \( B = 7 \).
   - **IJ = 80** (multiple of 10) fixes \( I = 8 \), \( J = 0 \).

5. **Verify Sums:**
   - \( A+B+C+D+E = 5+7+3+6+9 = 30 \) ✔️
   - \( F+G+H+I = 1+2+4+8 = 15 \) ✔️

4,"Question: Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?
 Solution: 199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.

(If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understanding Star Construction**: A valid n-point star is drawn by connecting every k-th point, where k (step size) must be coprime to n and 1 < k < n/2. This ensures the star is formed without repeating lines or forming a polygon.

2. **Euler's Totient Function (φ(n))**: Calculate φ(n), which counts integers less than n coprime to n. For n = 1000 (factored as \(2^3 \times 5^3\)):
   \[
   φ(1000) = 1000 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) = 400.
   \]

3. **Adjust for Symmetry and Invalid Steps**:
   - Exclude step sizes 1 and n-1 (they form polygons, not stars), reducing the count by 2.
   - Divide by 2 to account for mirror/rotational symmetry (step size k and n−k produce the same star).

4. **Final Formula**:
   \[
   \text{Number of distinct stars} = \frac{φ(n) - 2}{2}.
   \]
   Substituting φ(1000) = 400:
   \[
   \frac{400 - 2}{2} = 199.

5,"Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?
 Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

1. **Identify the Straight Order:** The opponent's cards are laid out as Ten (T), Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A) from left to right (positions 1-5).

2. **Clue 5 Analysis:** The Ace (position 5) cannot border black cards (clubs/spades) or diamonds. Thus, its only neighbor (King at position 4) must be a heart.

3. **Clue 1 Application:** The King (heart) must border a diamond. This diamond must be the Queen (position 3) since the Ace cannot be a diamond (clue 5).

4. **Clue 3 Constraints:** The Jack (position 2) must border a spade and no hearts. The Ten (position 1) is a spade to satisfy this.

5. **Clue 4 Verification:** The Ten (spade) must border a club. This forces the Jack (position 2) to be a club.

6. **Assign Remaining Suits:** The Queen is diamond (from step 3), King is heart, and the Ace's suit must avoid duplicates adjacent or violating clue 5. The Ace must be a club, creating two non-adjacent clubs (Jack and Ace).

7. **Clue 7 Validation:** Only removing the Ten and Ace leaves Jack, Queen, King in ascending order. Other pairs fail due to the suit constraints and position rules.

6,"Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.
 Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs

7,"Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?
 Solution: First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""

If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **First Question to the Middle God:**
   - **Ask:** ""If I asked you if the god to your left is Random, would you say *ja*?""
   - **Analysis:**  
     - If the answer is *ja*: Either the left god is Random (if the middle is True/False) or the middle is Random. In either case, the **right god is not Random**.  
     - If the answer is *da*: Either the left god is not Random (if the middle is True/False) or the middle is Random. In either case, the **left god is not Random**.  
   - **Outcome:** Identify a god who is **not Random** (either left or right).

2. **Second Question to the Non-Random God:**
   - **Ask:** ""If I asked you if you are True, would you say *ja*?""
   - **Analysis:**  
     - A *ja* answer means the god is **True** (truthful confirmation).  
     - A *da* answer means the god is **False** (lying about their identity).  
   - **Outcome:** Determine if the non-Random god is **True** or **False**.

3. **Third Question to the Same Non-Random God:**
   - **Ask:** ""If I asked you if the middle god is Random, would you say *ja*?""
   - **Analysis:**  
     - If the answer is *ja*: The middle god is **Random**.  
     - If the answer is *da*: The middle god is **not Random**.  
   - **Outcome:**  
     - If the middle is Random, the remaining god (left/right) takes the third identity.  
     - If the middle is not Random, the remaining god is Random.  

**Logical Consistency:**  
- By using **hypothetical questions**, you bypass uncertainty about *ja/da* meanings.  
- True/False gods’ answers are consistent regardless of language, while Random’s answers are filtered out in the first step.  
- Each step isolates one identity, allowing deduction of the remaining gods.  

**Example Flow:**  
1. After the first question, suppose the right god is not Random.  
2. Ask the right god the second question: If *ja*, they are True; if *da*, False.  
3. Ask the same god the third question: If *ja*, middle is Random; else, middle is the opposite of the god’s identity (True/False).  

This method ensures all three gods are uniquely identified in three questions.",True
8,"Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.
 Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.
Summary:
14th, Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16, Little Curl
15th, Stonefly Nymph, Cutthroat, 19, Bottle Well

19th, Yuk Bug, Lake Trout, 27, Big Rock Isle
20th, Parachute Adams, Rainbow, 22, Deep Channel
21st, Humpy, Humpback Trout, 17, Big Little Falls",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Fixed Dates and Locations:**
   - Clue 2 states Mad Ade fished at Big Rock Isle on the 19th. Clue 4 places the Humpback on the 21st at Big Little Falls. The 17th is designated for the Monkey Trout (Clue 4).

2. **Assign Fish Sizes with Parity Constraints:**
   - Sizes are 8, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 27 inches. Even sizes (8,16,22,24) align with even days (14th, 18th, 20th) and odd sizes (17,19,27) with odd days (15th,17th,19th,21st), except one exception (Clue 5). The 17th (odd day) holds 24 inches (even size) as the exception.

3. **Determine Wet vs. Dry Flies:**
   - Wet flies (Stonefly Nymph, Little Mouse, Yuk Bug) are used on the 15th, 17th, and 19th. After the 19th, only dry flies (Elk Hair Caddis, Mayfly, Parachute Adams, Humpy) are used (Clue 3).

4. **Sequence of Flies and Fish:**
   - The Elk Hair Caddis (14th) precedes the Brookside Trout (18th), which precedes Deep Channel (20th) (Clue 1). The Little Mouse (17th) follows the Dolly Varden (14th) and precedes the Parachute Adams (20th) (Clue 3). The Stonefly Nymph (15th) precedes the Mayfly (18th) by two fishing days (Clue 3).

5. **Resolve Fish Sizes and Varieties:**
   - The 19-inch Cutthroat is at Bottle Well (15th) (Clue 5). The Monkey Trout (24 inches, 17th) is smaller than the Lake Trout (27 inches, 19th) and larger than the Rainbow (22 inches, 20th) (Clue 4). The Humpback (17 inches, 21st) satisfies the size parity rule (Clue 5).

6. **Finalize Locations and Comparisons:**
   - Little Curl (14th, 16 inches) > Dish Creek (18th, 8 inches) < Big Little Falls (21st, 17 inches) (Clue 2). The Rainbow (22 inches) > Cutthroat (19 inches) (Clue 5).

**Final Assignments:**
- **14th:** Elk Hair Caddis (dry), Dolly Varden (16""), Little Curl.  
- **15th:** Stonefly Nymph (wet), Cutthroat (19""), Bottle Well.  
- **17th:** Little Mouse (wet), Monkey Trout (24""), Old Cutbank.  
- **18th:** Mayfly (dry), Brookside Trout (8""), Dish Creek.  
- **19th:** Yuk Bug (wet), Lake Trout (27""), Big Rock Isle.  
- **20th:** Parachute Adams (dry), Rainbow (22""), Deep Channel.  
- **21st:** Humpy (dry), Humpback (17""), Big Little Falls.  

**Key Logic:** Constraints on dates, size parity, fly types, and fish variety were systematically resolved through elimination and sequencing based on clues. The exception to size parity on the 17th and the use of wet/dry flies after the 19th were pivotal in narrowing assignments.",True

11,"Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?
 Solution: Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.

1. **Determine the Planting Days and Locations:**
   - From clue 2.2, the East side was planted on the week's last day (Saturday, May 25th).
   - Clue 1.4 rules out Tomatoes in the East. Radishes are planted on May 25th in the East (clue 1.1 links Radishes to Peppers three days later).
   - Radishes (25th, East) → Peppers on May 28th (25 + 3 days).

2. **Assign Days Based on Sequence:**
   - Clue 1.3: West planted one day before Broccoli. Possible pairs: West on 29th → Broccoli on 30th.
   - Clue 3.3: South planted one day before Lettuce. South on 28th → Lettuce on 29th (West location).

3. **Assign Rows Using Clues:**
   - South has 3 rows (clue 2.1), assigned to Peppers (planted on 28th).
   - Lettuce has fewer than 3 rows (clue 3.2) → 1 row (West, 29th).
   - Broccoli (not in West or 29th) → Northwest with 2 rows (even number per clue 2.4), planted on 30th.
   - Radishes (4 rows) > Broccoli (2 rows) but < Tomatoes (5 rows) per clue 1.2 → Tomatoes in North on May 27th.

4. **Verify All Constraints:**
   - Tomatoes (5 rows, North, 27th) avoid East (clue 1.4).
   - Order of planting rows: 4 (Radishes), 5 (Tomatoes), 3 (Peppers), 1 (Lettuce), 2 (Broccoli) satisfies clue 3.1.
   - All days (25, 27–30), locations, and row counts (1–5) are uniquely assigned.

**FINAL ANSWER:**

- **Tomatoes:** 5 rows, May 27th, North  
- **Peppers:** 3 rows, May 28th, South  
- **Radishes:** 4 rows, May 25th, East  
- **Lettuce:** 1 row, May 29th, West  
- **Broccoli:** 2 rows, May 30th, Northwest",True

I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.

1. **Determine Possible Values for A and B Using Clues 9 and 10:**
   - Clue 9 links A to the comparison of I and J. If I > J, A = 3 or 7; else, A = 4 or 8.
   - Clue 10 links B to the comparison of J and A. If J > A, B = 0 or 9; else, B = 2 or 3.
   - Since A cannot be 0 (no leading zeros), possible values for A are 3, 4, 7, or 8. B can be 0, 9, 2, or 3.

2. **Test A = 8 (Logical Starting Point Due to Constraints):**
   - Assume A = 8 (clue 9: I ≤ J). From clue 10, J < A, so B = 2 or 3. Choose B = 2 (since J will later resolve to 3, avoiding duplication).

3. **Apply Clue 1 (A > B):**
   - Since 8 > 2, C must be 5 or 7. Select C = 7 (5 is eliminated in later steps).

4. **Apply Clue 2 (B < C):**
   - 2 < 7 ⇒ D = 4 or 9. Assign D = 4 (9 conflicts with later steps).

5. **Apply Clue 3 (C > D):**
   - 7 > 4 ⇒ E = 6 or 9. Assign E = 9 (6 conflicts with F).

6. **Apply Clue 4 (D < E):**
   - 4 < 9 ⇒ F = 1 or 6. Assign F = 6 (1 conflicts with G).

7. **Apply Clue 5 (E > F):**
   - 9 > 6 ⇒ G = 5 or 6. Assign G = 5 (6 duplicates F).

8. **Apply Clue 6 (F > G):**
   - 6 > 5 ⇒ H = 1 or 4. Assign H = 1 (4 conflicts with D).

9. **Apply Clue 7 (G > H):**
   - 5 > 1 ⇒ I = 0 or 8. Assign I = 0 (8 duplicates A).

10. **Apply Clue 8 (H > I):**
    - 1 > 0 ⇒ J = 3 or 8. Assign J = 3 (8 duplicates A).

11. **Verify Clues 9 and 10:**
    - Clue 9: I = 0 < J = 3 ⇒ A = 4 or 8 (matches A = 8).
    - Clue 10: J = 3 < A = 8 ⇒ B = 2 or 3 (matches B = 2).

16,"Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.
 Solution: From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.

Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).

Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.

17,"Question: Johnny was given 16 coins by his older, somewhat meaner brother, Mark.  He told him that he could keep them all if he could place all 16 on the table in such a way that they formed 15 rows with 4 coins in each row.
After 10 minutes, Johnny walked away with the coins and Mark, after complaining futilely to his mother, left with nothing.
How did Johnny place the coins?
 Solution: If you draw a 5-pointed star with all sides of equal length, you will create a pentagon in the middle with all 5 sides of equal length. Then draw another 5 pointed star, upside-down, using the 5 points of the interior pentagon as the points of the inner star,  This will give you another 5-sided pentagon in the interior of the second, smaller star.
Now, take your 16 coins and place 5 on the outside points of the outside star.  Then place 5 more on the points of each of the two pentagons you have created.  Finally, place the last coin in the dead center of this drawing.
The lines are as follows:
5 lines for the actual drawing of the outside star
5 lines for the actual drawing of the inside star
5 lines that start from any outside point of the outside star and go to the opposite point of the inside star, passing through 1 point of the inner pentagon, the dead center coin on the way.

1. **Create an Outer Pentagram:**
   - Draw a regular 5-pointed star (pentagram) with 5 outer vertices. Place 1 coin on each outer vertex (5 coins total).

2. **Form an Inner Pentagon:**
   - The intersections of the outer star’s lines form a smaller pentagon inside. Place 1 coin on each of these 5 inner vertices (total now 10 coins).

3. **Add an Inverted Inner Star:**
   - Draw another 5-pointed star inside the inner pentagon, rotated 36 degrees (upside-down relative to the outer star). This creates a second inner pentagon. Place 1 coin on each of its 5 vertices (total now 15 coins).

4. **Place the Central Coin:**
   - Position the 16th coin at the exact geometric center where all star lines intersect.

5. **Define the 15 Rows:**
   - **Outer Star Rows (5):** Each line of the outer pentagram connects 2 outer vertices and passes through 2 inner pentagon vertices (4 coins per line).
   - **Inner Star Rows (5):** Each line of the inverted inner star connects 2 vertices of the second inner pentagon, passing through 2 other inner points (4 coins per line).
   - **Radial Rows (5):** Lines connecting each outer vertex to the diametrically opposite inner vertex, passing through 1 inner pentagon vertex and the center (4 coins per line).

**Result:** All 16 coins are used, with each of the 15 rows containing exactly 4 coins. The overlapping geometric design ensures maximum reuse of coins across multiple rows.",True

1. **Clue 6 & 9**: Column I must have three odd numbers (rows 1,3,5). I5 is forced to be 25 (only odd multiple of 5 in 16-30). I3 (divisible by 3) must be 27, as 27*51=1377 (clue 9), fixing G3=51.

2. **Clue 13**: N4 is the average of I1 and G1. Since I1 must be odd (column I), G1 must also be odd. Solving (I1 + G1)/2 = N4 (divisible by 4), we find I1=23 and G1=57, yielding N4=40.

3. **Clue 10**: B1 + O1 = 82. With B1 in 1-15 and O1 in 61-75, B1=7 and O1=75 fit uniquely (7+75=82).

4. **Clue 5**: Column B contains consecutive numbers. After assigning B1=7, B4=8 (from clue 12), and B5=10 (clue 4), the sequence 6,7,8,9,10 completes column B.

5. **Clue 2 & 12**: Row 2 must have all units digits as 6. Assign B2=6, I2=26, G2=56, O2=66. N2=36 (midway between B4=8 and O4=64).

6. **Clue 3**: Row 4 units digits must differ. Assign I4=16 (smallest even in column I), G4=52, O4=64 (from clue 12), ensuring unique units digits (6, 6, 0, 2, 4 corrected to 8,6,0,2,4 via B4=8).

7. **Clue 4 & 7**: Row 5 sum divisible by 7. Assign B5=10, I5=25, G5=60 (clue 7), O5=70. Total sum 210 (divisible by 7).

Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.  From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.
1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.
2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.
3) The most populous group has 10 more members than the least populous group.
4) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs.
5) There are as many snake heads as there are spider heads.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).

Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Adjust for Extra Heads:**
   - Total heads = 100, but 3 extra heads (2 from snake, 1 from bird) mean **97 total animals**.
   - Each group has distinct quantities, with the largest group **10 more** than the smallest.

2. **Find Valid Group Sizes:**
   - List sets of 5 distinct numbers summing to 97, differing by at most 10. Example sets include:
     - `15, 17, 19, 21, 25` (validates all constraints).

3. **Apply Insect-Bird Leg Relationship:**
   - Insect legs = 2 × bird legs. Formula: \( B = \frac{(6I - 2)}{4} \).
   - Valid pairs: \( (I=13, B=19) \), \( (I=15, B=22) \), \( (I=17, B=25) \).

4. **Match Snake and Spider Heads:**
   - Snake heads = Spider heads. Since one snake has +2 heads: \( \text{Snakes} + 2 = \text{Spiders} \).
   - Valid pairs: \( \text{Snakes}=19 \), \( \text{Spiders}=21 \).

5. **Verify Total Legs:**
   - Calculate legs for remaining candidate sets:
     - **Set 1** (13,19,20,22,23): Total legs = 380 (invalid).
     - **Set 2** (15,17,19,21,25): Total legs = 376 (valid).

**Final Answer:**
- **Snakes:** 19  
- **Birds:** 25  
- **Mammals:** 15  
- **Insects:** 17  
- **Spiders:** 21  

**Verification:**
- **Heads:** \(19 + 2 + 25 + 1 + 15 + 17 + 21 = 100\) (including extra heads).  
- **Legs:** \(19×0 + 25×2 + (15×4 -1) + (17×6 -2) + (21×8 -1) = 376\).",True
20,"Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?
 Solution: Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car.

21,"Question: Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?
 Solution: Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.
If d=2, the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 can be made into 1*8*9=3*4*6=72, and we can have c=9, e=4: 9*2*4=72.
If d=8, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 can be made into 1*4*9=2*3*6=36, but 36 is not divisible by 8.
Therefore, the middle sportsman's number is 2.","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.

1. **Identify Excluded Digits:** Since each sportsman has a unique 1-digit number and the products must be equal, primes 5 and 7 are excluded (they cannot be formed by multiplying other digits). The remaining digits are **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9**.

2. **Prime Factorization Analysis:** Factorize all digits:  
   - Total product of all seven digits: \(2^7 \times 3^4\).  
   - Let \(abc = cde = efg = P\). The total product is \(P^2 \times d\), so \(P^2 \times d = 2^7 \times 3^4\).  

3. **Determine Valid Middle Digit (d):**  
   - For \(P^2\) to be a perfect square, \(d\) must divide \(2^7 \times 3^4\) such that \(2^7 \times 3^4 / d\) is a perfect square.  
   - Only **d = 2 or 8** satisfy this condition (they adjust exponents of 2 and 3 to even values).  

4. **Case 1: d = 2**  
   - \(P^2 = 2^6 \times 3^4\) ⇒ \(P = 72\).  
   - Split remaining digits **1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9** into triplets with product 72:  
     - Middle triplet: \(c \times 2 \times e = 72\) ⇒ \(c \times e = 36\). The valid pair is **c = 9, e = 4**.  
     - First triplet: \(1 \times 8 \times 9 = 72\).  
     - Last triplet: \(4 \times 3 \times 6 = 72\).  

5. **Case 2: d = 8**  
   - \(P^2 = 2^4 \times 3^4\) ⇒ \(P = 36\).  
   - Middle triplet: \(c \times 8 \times e = 36\) ⇒ \(c \times e = 4.5\), which is impossible with integers.

22,"Question: The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.
 Solution: Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.

1. **Establish a Parity Agreement:**  
   The group agrees that the first responder (person #10) will use their answer to communicate the parity (even or odd) of the total number of **white hats** they observe on the other 9 people. For example:  
   - ""White"" = Even number of white hats.  
   - ""Black"" = Odd number of white hats.  

2. **First Person’s Role (Sacrificial Clue):**  
   Person #10 (last in line) counts the white hats on persons #1–#9. They announce ""white"" or ""black"" to encode the parity. This gives no direct information about their own hat but provides a reference for others.  

3. **Subsequent Deductions:**  
   Each subsequent person (#9 to #1) uses the parity announced by #10 and the answers of all previous responders to determine their own hat color:  
   - Person #9 calculates the parity of white hats they see (#1–#8) and compares it to the initial parity. The difference reveals their own hat color.  
   - Person #8 repeats this process, incorporating #9’s answer to deduce their own hat color, and so on.  

4. **Guaranteed Survival for 9:**  
   By propagating the parity information through their answers, persons #9–#1 can always deduce their hat color correctly. Only person #10 risks a 50% chance of being wrong, but all others survive with certainty.  

**Key Insight:**  
The strategy leverages parity (modulo 2 arithmetic) to encode critical information in the first response. Each subsequent responder uses this shared parity and prior answers to reconstruct their own hat color, maximizing survival to **9 guaranteed survivors**.",True

""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?

   - Names (by last letter): Elena (a), Caleb (b), Derec (c), Brand (d), Adele (e). Alphabetical order would be Elena, Caleb, Derec, Brand, Adele. Reverse order would be Adele, Brand, Derec, Caleb, Elena. The actual birth order must have all names misplaced compared to both orders.

3. **Assign Names to Birth Times:**
   - **6:00 (1st):** Derec (last letter 'c'). In alphabetical order, Derec should be 3rd; in reverse, 3rd. Neither matches 1st.
   - **6:10 (2nd):** Adele (last letter 'e'). In alphabetical order, Adele should be 5th; in reverse, 1st. Neither matches 2nd.
   - **6:40 (3rd):** Brand (last letter 'd'). In alphabetical order, Brand should be 4th; in reverse, 2nd. Neither matches 3rd.
   - **7:30 (4th):** Elena (last letter 'a'). In alphabetical order, Elena should be 1st; in reverse, 5th. Neither matches 4th.
   - **7:50 (5th):** Caleb (last letter 'b'). In alphabetical order, Caleb should be 2nd; in reverse, 4th. Neither matches 5th.

4. **Validate the 50-Minute Interval:**
   - Brand (6:40) and Elena (7:30) are separated by 50 minutes, matching the clue.

5. **Confirm Birth Order Consistency:**
   - Nora and Caleb share the same birth position (5th). Since Nora’s older sister Cogita is the mother, Nora cannot be the firstborn, aligning Caleb as the 5th child.

**Final Birth Order:**
- **6:00:** Derec  
- **6:10:** Adele  
- **6:40:** Brand  
- **7:30:** Elena  
- **7:50:** Caleb",True
24,"Question: Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.
 Solution: SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.
The names of BEAUTY's mom and aunt and that of the oldest black are immaterial. The same is true with the color of lucky.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.

1. **Derby Age Requirement**: Only 3-year-old horses can enter. The horse that lost last year must now be 4.

2. **Current 3-Year-Olds**:  
   - **BILLY** (brown male) is explicitly 3.  
   - **BEAUTY** and **LUCKY** (cousins) are each half their aunt’s age. For them to be 3, their aunt must be 6.  

3. **BEAUTY’s Lineage**:  
   - **BEAUTY’s mother** (a black mare) won the Derby when she was 3. Since BEAUTY is 3, her mother must now be ≥4 (likely 5 or older to avoid conflict with last year’s loss).  
   - **BEAUTY’s aunt** (the other half-sister) is 6.  

4. **Identifying the 4-Year-Old**:  
   - **SNOWY** is white. The only possible 4-year-old (eligible to have raced last year at 3).  
   - **BILLY** (3 now) was too young last year.  
   - The oldest black horse (a stallion) is older than BEAUTY’s mother (≥4), making him ≥5 and ineligible for last year’s Derby.  

5. **Stallion Requirement**:  
   - The problem specifies the **stallion** (male) lost last year. **SNOWY** is male, white, and 4, fitting all criteria.

25,"Question: There is a 10-digit number, represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) A + D = a square number
2) G + J = a triangle number
3) B + I = an even number
4) E * F = an odd number
5) C * H = a prime number
6) A / G = G / C
7) E + I = B + H
 Solution: 4615972308
For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.","A triangle number can be expressed as the sum of the numbers 1 to n, for any integer value of n.

1. **Identify Prime Constraint (Clue #5):**  
   Since \( C \times H \) is prime, one must be 1. Possible pairs: \( (C=1, H \text{ prime}) \) or \( (H=1, C \text{ prime}) \).

2. **Geometric Progression (Clue #6):**  
   \( \frac{A}{G} = \frac{G}{C} \implies A \times C = G^2 \). Valid triplets:  
   - \( 931 \) (\( 9/3 = 3/1 \)),  
   - \( 421 \) (\( 4/2 = 2/1 \)),  
   - \( 842 \) (invalid due to \( D=1 \) conflicting with \( H=1 \)).  
   Eliminate \( 842 \).

3. **Test \( AGC = 931 \):**  
   - \( A + D \) must be square: \( D = 0 \) or \( 7 \).  
   - \( G + J \) must be triangular: \( J = 0 \) or \( 7 \).  
   - Conflicts arise with odd digits (only 5 left for \( E \times F \)), so invalid.  

4. **Confirm \( AGC = 421 \):**  
   - \( A = 4 \), \( G = 2 \), \( C = 1 \).  
   - \( A + D \) square: \( D = 0 \) or \( 5 \).  
   - \( G + J = 10 \implies J = 8 \).  
   - \( D = 5 \) (since \( J=8 \), avoiding duplication).  

5. **Assign Remaining Digits:**  
   - Used digits: \( 4, 2, 1, 5, 8 \). Remaining: \( 0, 3, 6, 7, 9 \).  
   - \( B + I \) even: \( (0,6) \) or \( (3,9) \).  
   - \( C \times H = \text{prime} \implies H = 3 \).  
   - \( E \times F \) odd: \( E = 9 \), \( F = 7 \).  
   - \( E + I = B + H \implies 9 + 0 = 6 + 3 \). Assign \( B = 6 \), \( I = 0 \).  

6. **Final Verification:**  
   - Digits: \( A=4, B=6, C=1, D=5, E=9, F=7, G=2, H=3, I=0, J=8 \).  
   - All clues satisfied.

26,"Question: Did you know that the mango is one of the world's most popular fruits? The mango is grown in North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, south and central Africa, as well as its native southern and south-east Asia.
The mango is also packed with vitamins A, B and C.
While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:
BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH
QUEST
QUICK
VIEUX
Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?
 Solution: Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.
1: M, C, T, W, X
2: A, L, R, V, Q
3: N, H, F, B, U
4: G, E, Y, J, K
5: O, P, D, I, S","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.

Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J

1. **Initial Assignment Based on MANGO:**
   - Pyramid 1: M
   - Pyramid 2: A
   - Pyramid 3: N
   - Pyramid 4: G
   - Pyramid 5: O

2. **Resolve LEMON and PEACH Conflicts:**
   - LEMON shares M, N, O. Assign L to Pyramid 2 (with A) and E to Pyramid 4 (with G). 
   - PEACH requires E (Pyramid 4) and A (Pyramid 2) to be on separate pyramids. P is assigned to Pyramid 5 (with O).

3. **Assign Letters for OCHRE and CANDY:**
   - OCHRE: C (Pyramid 1), H (Pyramid 3), R (Pyramid 2), E (Pyramid 4). 
   - CANDY: C (Pyramid 1), D (Pyramid 5), Y (Pyramid 4). 

4. **Handle FORTY and LIGHT:**
   - FORTY: F (Pyramid 3), T (Pyramid 1), Y (Pyramid 4). 
   - LIGHT: I (Pyramid 5), T (Pyramid 1). 

5. **Assign JABOT and BELOW:**
   - JABOT: J (Pyramid 4), B (Pyramid 3). 
   - BELOW: W (Pyramid 1), B (Pyramid 3). 

6. **Finalize HELIX, VIEUX, QUEST, and QUICK:**
   - HELIX: X (Pyramid 1). 
   - VIEUX: V (Pyramid 2), U (Pyramid 3). 
   - QUEST: Q (Pyramid 2), S (Pyramid 5). 
   - QUICK: K (Pyramid 4).

- **Pyramid 1:** M, C, T, W, X  
- **Pyramid 2:** A, L, R, V, Q  
- **Pyramid 3:** N, H, F, B, U  
- **Pyramid 4:** G, E, Y, J, K  
- **Pyramid 5:** O, P, D, I, S  

**Key Logic:** Each word uses one letter from each pyramid. Conflicts (e.g., shared letters in words) are resolved by ensuring no two letters from the same word share a pyramid. Overlapping words guide letter placement through elimination.",True

28,"Question: Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated
 Solution: Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.
Ivy & Carl were swapped",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify the Liar through conflicting statements:**
   - Carl claims Ivy is the Liar (Statement 2). If true, Ivy lies in Statements 6 (""I wasn't switched"") and 12 (""I'm the Spy""). Both must be false, confirming Ivy as the Liar. If Carl were lying, he’d be the Liar, but this contradicts later truths (Steps 3–5).

2. **Establish truth-tellers via role constraints:**
   - Xavior’s statements (4, 10, 16) align if he’s the Detective:
     - ""Draco or June is Normal"" (10): June is later confirmed as Cupid, so Draco = Normal.
     - ""I know the Switcher"" (4) and ""I’m not the Spy"" (16) hold if Xavior is Detective.

3. **Determine Cupid through pairing logic:**
   - June’s Statement 7 (""Emma knows Draco’s role"") implies Draco and Emma were paired by Cupid. Since Cupid can’t pair themselves, June must be Cupid. Her Statement 13 (""Cupid wasn’t switched"") confirms she remained Cupid post-switch.

4. **Assign Switcher using process of elimination:**
   - Emma cannot be Normal (Xavior’s truthful Statement 10), Detective (Xavior), Liar (Ivy), Spy (Statement 11: ""I don’t know the Spy""), or Cupid (June). Thus, Emma = Switcher.

5. **Resolve Spy and final roles:**
   - Carl’s Statements 8 (""Xavior knows who was switched"") and 14 (""Xavior isn’t Cupid"") are true, so Carl isn’t the Liar. He must be the Spy, as Ivy’s false claim (12) rules her out. Draco, the Normal, has no conflicting statements.

**ROLE ASSIGNMENTS:**
- **Normal**: Draco  
- **Liar**: Ivy  
- **Detective**: Xavior  
- **Switcher**: Emma  
- **Cupid**: June  
- **Spy**: Carl  

**KEY LOGIC:**
- Ivy’s lies and Carl’s truths resolve the Liar/Spy conflict.  
- Xavior’s Detective role explains his knowledge of the Switcher.  
- June’s Cupid role and pairing explain Draco/Emma’s knowledge.  
- Switcher Emma’s action post-Statement 1 aligns with Ivy’s false denial of being switched.",True
29,"Question: One day, an eccentric billionaire decided to give a destitute man a break. But not a total break, as we shall see. So, he invites him into a room in his mansion with seven doors. There is also a large-screen projector that projects the following five images, repeatedly, one at a time:
A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.
The poor man was allowed an entire day to study the images, after which he would have to choose the door that corresponded to the commonality of the images. The next day the man walked through the correct door, and the billionaire made him rich. What door did the man choose?
 Solution: The man chose door number FOUR. Here's why:
The image of the human brain made the man think of 'four corners of the mind.'
He recognized the capital letters AZCONMUT to be the abbreviations of the 'Four corner states' Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. He completed the phrase
'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners. Thus, the poor guy walked into a mansion poorer than poor, and walked out with a cheese sandwich, and enough dough to buy a small country. What he actually did with the money is anybody's guess.","Take a snack break, have one of the images.","The man chose door number FOUR. Here's why:

30,"Question: A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler.  The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.
Suspect A:
1. C and I have met many times before today.
2. B is guilty.
3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Suspect B:
1. D did not do it.
2. D's third statement is false.
3. I am innocent.
Suspect C:
1. I have never met A before today.
2. B is not guilty.
3. D knows how to drive.
Suspect D:
1. B's first statement is false.
2. I do not know how to drive.
3. A did it.
Which one is the car thief?
 Solution: Consider that six statements are false. A's first statement and C's first statement contradict each other.  One of them is false.  C's and D's  contradict each other.  One of them is false.  Therefore, there are four additional false statements.
Assume A is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's second statement, and D's first statement are the additional false statements.
Assume D is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's first statement, and D's third statement are false.  This also only makes five false statements.  D did not do it.
Assume C did it.  If so, A's second statement, D's first and third statements are false.  This again, makes only five false statements.
After ruling out suspects A, C and D, B is the culprit.  B's third statement, C's second statement, and D's first and third statements are the additional false statements.

   - This accounts for 2 truths and 2 falsehoods. Remaining: 4 truths and 4 falsehoods.

2. **Test Each Suspect as the Thief:**
   - **Assume A is guilty:** Results in 7 true and 5 false statements (invalid).
   - **Assume B is guilty:**
     - B3 (""I'm innocent"") is false. B1 (""D didn't do it"") and B2 (""D3 is false"") are true.
     - A2 (""B is guilty"") and A3 (""thief didn't know"") are true. A1 is true (met C), making C1 false.
     - C3 (""D drives"") is true, so D2 (""doesn't drive"") is false.
     - D1 (""B1 is false"") is false; D3 (""A did it"") is false.
     - Total: 6 true (A1, A2, A3; B1, B2; C3) and 6 false (C1, C2; D1, D2, D3; B3). **Valid.**
   - **Assume C is guilty:** Results in mismatched counts (7T/5F).
   - **Assume D is guilty:** Results in mismatched counts (6T/5F).

32,"Question: These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed
 Solution: First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant.

3. **Identify Surnames and Companies:**
   - Edgar’s surname is Casson or Graves (clue 6). Casson works for Blue Teeth/Chiptech (clue 9). Since Edgar is in Chiptech (Twin Room), he is **Edgar Casson (Chiptech)**.

4. **Position Assignments:**
   - Director cannot work for Lantel/Blue Teeth (clue 2). Thus, Director must be Edgar Casson (Chiptech).
   - CEO cannot be Alan or Joshua (clue 10) and must work for Reed Right (exclusion of other companies). CEO is **Joshua Graves (Reed Right)**.

Here are your constraints:
-You have nothing else at your disposal.
-There is no other water aside from the two 8-liter water filled jugs.
-Once water is poured into any of the 4 pools it cannot be removed from there.
-The jugs are not symmetric so you cannot measure amount by eye or judge based on shape.

1. **Initial Distribution to Pools:**
   - Transfer 3 liters from Jug A to Pool 1 using Jug C.
   - Transfer 2 liters from Jug A to Pool 2 by partially filling Jug C and leaving the remainder.

2. **Creating Intermediate Quantities:**
   - Use Jug C to redistribute water between Jugs A and B, creating 6 liters in Jug A and leaving 5 liters in Jug B.
   - Further transfers reduce Jug B to 2 liters and leave 1 liter in Jug C, which is then added to Pool 3.

3. **Final Adjustments to Pools:**
   - Transfer 1 liter from Jug C to Pool 1 (completing Pool 1 to 4 liters).
   - Use Jug B's remaining 5 liters to fill Jug C and add 3 liters to Pool 3 (total 4 liters).
   - Transfer the last 3 liters from Jug B (via Jug C) to Pool 4 and the remaining 2 liters to Pool 2 (completing all pools to 4 liters).

**LOGICAL STEPS:**

1. **Fill Pool 1 and Pool 2:**
   - Pour from Jug A (8L) into Jug C (3L), leaving 5L in A. Empty C into Pool 1 (3L).
   - Repeat, leaving 2L in A, which is poured into Pool 2 (2L).

2. **Redistribute Between Jugs:**
   - Move remaining 3L from C to A (now 3L in A). Fill C from B (8L → 5L in B, 3L in C).
   - Transfer C to A (A: 6L). Refill C from B (B: 2L, C: 3L). Pour 2L from B into C, leaving 1L in C.

3. **Partial Fill for Pools 3 and 4:**
   - Transfer 1L from C to Pool 3. Fill C from B’s remaining 2L (now B: 0, C: 2L).
   - Refill C from A (now A: 7L, C: 3L). Transfer C to B (B: 3L). Repeat to fill B to 6L.

4. **Final Transfers to Complete All Pools:**
   - Pour 1L from A into Pool 4. Use remaining 4L in A to fill C and transfer to B (B: 8L).
   - Distribute B’s 8L: 2L to Pool 2 (total 4L), 3L to Pool 3 (total 4L), and 3L to Pool 4 (total 4L).

**RESULT:** All four pools contain exactly 4 liters, and all jugs are empty.",True
34,"Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.","Last names: Averson, Chang, Diaz, Fitzroy, Gianelli, McNeilly, Toskhaya and White","RANKING/ PLAYER/ GAMES

1. **Total Games Calculation:**
   - Total games: 55 (Clue 7). 
   - First round: 30 games, leaving 25 for later rounds.
   - Final match (Clue 3): Maximum 9 games (5-4 score). Thus, second round: 25 - 9 = 16 games.
   - Second round has two matches. Winners need ≥5 games. Let winners' games be \(5 + 5 = 10\), leaving 6 games for losers. Since totals must be unique, losers in second round have 2 and 4 games (total 6).

2. **First Round Losers’ Games:**
   - Four first-round losers lose 1, 2, 3, 4 games (sum = 10) to meet the 30-game total (4 matches × 5 wins + 10 losses).

Block 3: I, U, N, H, J, C
Block 4: D, L, O, V, T, F",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**  
To determine the letter assignments for each block such that all given words can be formed without repeating blocks, follow these steps:

1. **List All Letters and Words**:  
   Extract all unique letters from the provided words. There are 24 letters, matching the 4 blocks × 6 letters each.

2. **Identify Incompatible Letters**:  
   For each letter, list all letters it appears with in any word. These pairs cannot share the same block.  
   *Example*:  
   - **A** appears with H, O, X, R, N, D, F, I, V, E, C, B, L.  
   - **O** appears with H, A, X, J, E, Y, M, N, K, S, P.  

3. **Partition Letters into Blocks**:  
   Group letters such that no two letters in the same block are incompatible. This requires ensuring that:  
   - No two letters in a block co-occur in any word.  
   - Each block contains exactly 6 letters.  

4. **Verify Block Assignments**:  
   Check that every word uses one letter from each block. For example:  
   - **skid**: S (Block1), K (Block2), I (Block3), D (Block4).  
   - **hoax**: H (Block3), O (Block4), A (Block2), X (Block1).  

**Final Block Assignments**:  
- **Block1**: S, E, M, B, R, X  
- **Block2**: K, W, Y, A, G, P  
- **Block3**: I, U, N, H, J, C  
- **Block4**: D, L, O, V, T, F  

**Key Observations**:  
- Letters in the same block never appear together in any word.  
- The partitioning avoids overlaps by grouping letters with mutually exclusive incompatibilities.  
- Systematic elimination of conflicting pairs ensures valid assignments.",True

1. **Identify Initial Girls and Boys:**
   - **Girls (Clue 4):** Prime-numbered positions: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 (12 girls).
   - **Boys (Clue 5):** Square/cube-numbered positions: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 36 (8 boys).

2. **Meet Row/Column Constraints (Clue 2):**
   - Each row must have 2–4 girls, and each column must have 2–4 girls.
   - **Rows needing adjustments:** Row 5 initially has 1 girl (37); add 1 girl (33) to meet the minimum of 2.
   - **Columns needing adjustments:** Columns 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 require additional girls to meet the minimum of 2. Assign 8 more girls to these columns:
     - Column 1: Add girl at 33.
     - Column 2: Add girl at 10.
     - Column 4: Add girls at 12 and 20.
     - Column 6: Add girls at 30 and 38.
     - Column 8: Add girls at 32 and 40.

3. **Ensure Girls Border Each Other (Clue 3):**
   - Verify all new girls (e.g., 33, 10, 12, 20, 30, 38, 32, 40) border at least one other girl.

4. **Final Adjustments for Row Limits:**
   - Ensure no row exceeds 4 girls. For example, adjust placements in rows 3–5 to maintain limits.

5. **Identify Jacob (Clue 6):**
   - Calculate the number of girls each boy borders. Boys in rows 1–5 border varying numbers of girls (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
   - **Unique Case:** The boy at position 20 borders 6 girls (adjacent to girls at 12, 13, 19, 21, 27, and 28), making him the only boy with this unique count.

**ANSWER:** Jacob’s picture is at position **20**.",True
37,"Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?
 Solution: All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island.

If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understanding Common Knowledge:**  
   The guru’s statement (""I see a person with blue eyes"") converts the existence of at least one blue-eyed person from individual knowledge (everyone already saw others) into *common knowledge*. Now, everyone knows that everyone else knows there’s at least one blue-eyed person, and this allows logical induction to proceed.

2. **Base Case (1 Blue-Eyed Person):**  
   If there were 1 blue-eyed person, they would see no others with blue eyes. Hearing the guru’s statement, they would immediately deduce their own eye color and leave on the first night.

3. **Inductive Step for \( n \) Blue-Eyed People:**  
   If there are \( n \) blue-eyed people, each sees \( n-1 \) others. They all wait \( n-1 \) nights. If no one leaves by the \( (n-1)^{\text{th}} \) night, each infers their own eye must be blue (since others would have left earlier if \( n-1 \) were the total). All \( n \) leave on the \( n^{\text{th}} \) night.

4. **Applying to 100 Blue-Eyed People:**  
   Each blue-eyed person sees 99 others. They wait 99 nights. When no one leaves by the 99th night, they conclude their own eye color must be blue. All 100 blue-eyed people leave simultaneously on the 100th night.

5. **Brown-Eyed Islanders:**  
   The brown-eyed islanders see 100 blue-eyed people. However, they cannot deduce their own eye color because there are 100 brown-eyed people as well. The guru’s statement does not provide information about brown eyes, so they remain uncertain.

**Conclusion:**  
All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave on the 100th night. The inductive logic, triggered by the guru’s public statement and enforced by common knowledge, ensures they deduce their eye color in unison after 100 days.",True
38,"Question: It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.
 Solution: If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.

By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Determine the maximum number of drops (n):**  
   The goal is to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is at least 100 (the number of floors).  
   - The sum \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \geq 100 \).  
   - Solving for \( n \), the smallest integer is \( n = 14 \), since \( \frac{14 \times 15}{2} = 105 \geq 100 \).  

2. **Define the dropping sequence for the first ball:**  
   Start at floor 14, then increase by decreasing intervals (13, 12, 11, etc.) to ensure the total drops never exceed 14.  
   - **Sequence:** 14, 27 (14+13), 39 (27+12), 50 (39+11), 60 (50+10), 69 (60+9), 77 (69+8), 84 (77+7), 90 (84+6), 95 (90+5), 99 (95+4), 100.  

3. **Procedure if the first ball breaks:**  
   - Suppose the first ball breaks at the \( k \)-th drop (e.g., floor 39).  
   - Use the second ball to test floors sequentially starting from the previous floor +1 (e.g., after 27, test 28–38).  
   - The maximum number of additional drops with the second ball is \( (n - k) \), ensuring the total drops \( \leq 14 \).  

4. **Worst-case guarantee:**  
   - If the critical floor is 99, the first ball is dropped 11 times (14, 27, ..., 99).  
   - The second ball then tests 96–99, requiring 4 drops. Total drops: \( 11 + 4 = 15 \). Wait, this contradicts the initial claim. Let's correct:  
   - Correction: The sequence stops at 99 (11th drop). If the first ball survives 99, the next would be 103 (invalid). For floor 99, if the first ball breaks there, the second ball tests 96–98 (3 drops). Total drops: \( 11 + 3 = 14 \).  

**Final Answer:**  
The optimal strategy involves dropping the first ball from floors 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99. If it breaks, use the second ball to test sequentially from the last safe floor +1. This guarantees a maximum of **14 drops** to determine the critical floor.",True

1. **Analyze Camel Rankings and Prize Structure:**
   - Ali Bobo owns the 3rd (Aluminum), 6th (Boron), and 9th (Copper) fastest camels.
   - Competitors: Kareem (1st, 4th, 7th) and Sharif (2nd, 5th, 8th).
   - Races A, B, and C offer decreasing prize amounts. Bonuses (Slam/Sweep) are unattainable for Ali.

2. **Identify Last Year’s Strategy and Earnings:**
   - Ali placed each camel in separate races, earning 3rd place in all three: $100 (A) + $75 (B) + $50 (C) = **$225**.

3. **Devise a New Strategy to Maximize Minimum Earnings:**
   - Assign camels to races where they can outperform slower competitors:
     - **Copper (9th) in Race A**: Competes against Kareem’s 1st and Sharif’s 2nd, ensuring 3rd place ($100).
     - **Aluminum (3rd) in Race B**: Outruns Kareem’s 4th and Sharif’s 5th, securing 1st place ($250).
     - **Boron (6th) in Race C**: Outpaces Kareem’s 7th and Sharif’s 8th, winning 1st place ($150).

4. **Evaluate Scenarios for Risk-Free Improvement:**
   - **Best Case**: Ali earns **$500** if competitors spread camels (Scenario 1).
   - **Worst Case**: Competitors mirror Ali’s strategy, resulting in **$225** (Scenario 7), matching last year’s earnings.
   - **Intermediate Cases**: Earnings range between **$250–$600** depending on competitors’ strategies (Scenarios 2–6).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The strategy guarantees **no loss** compared to last year and offers potential gains. Since the worst-case outcome equals prior earnings and better scenarios yield more, it is **risk-free** and optimal. 

**STRATEGY:**  
Ali Bobo should enter **Copper in Race A**, **Aluminum in Race B**, and **Boron in Race C**. This ensures a minimum of $225 (no risk) and up to $500+ depending on competitors’ actions.",True
40,"Question: Six sets of twins ( a boy and a girl in every case) made several errors in their history and geography examinations; and it was noted that every girl made precisely the same number of errors as her brother in the two subjects. Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.
 Solution: Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12.

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12.

41,"Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)
 Solution: It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.

1. **Observation:** Each red-hatted dwarf sees \( r-1 \) red hats (where \( r \) is the total number of red hats).  
2. **Assumption:** Each assumes there are exactly \( r-1 \) red hats. If true, those \( r-1 \) dwarves would deduce their own red hats and leave on day \( r-1 \).  
3. **Induction:** If no dwarves leave by day \( r-1 \), each red-hatted dwarf infers there must be \( r \) red hats (including themselves).  
4. **Action:** All \( r \) red-hatted dwarves conclude their own hats are red and leave on day \( r \).  
5. **Result:** From day \( r+1 \) onward, no red hats remain.

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?
 Solution: The Order the finished in was: Ben, Paul, Jessica, Stephen, Brianna, Clark, Luke, Anna, Kelsey, Felicia, Brad, Abby.
Here is how they got there:
On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.
On the third lap the 10th and 11th place people switched spots, putting Kelsey in 10th, and Felicia in 11th. 5th and 6th place switched, making Brianna in 5th, and Clark in 6th, and the 7th and 8th place people switched, putting Luke in 7th and Anna in 8th. Brad was passed by the two people who were directly behind him which made Kelsey in 9th, Felicia in 10th, and Brad in 11th.

ABC
DEF
GHI
1. The sum of the top row is greater than the sum of the middle row, which is greater than the sum of the bottom row.
2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.
 Solution: A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

1. **Analyze Clue 2 (E and G relationship):**  
   - E must be a prime factor of G. Possible primes (2, 3).  
   - If **E=2**, G could be 4, 6, or 8.  
   - If **E=3**, G could be 6 or 9 (but G=9 forces B=0 for Clue 4, invalid). Thus, **E=2** is the only viable option.

   - **Top row (ABC):** A + 1 + C = 17 → A + C = 16. Assign **A=7, C=9** (since F=8 > A=7 satisfies Clue 3).

The nine letter code word, <$^&?*!#>, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Solution: Religious and Atheistic.",Belief,Religious and Atheistic.,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Symbol Mappings:** Each symbol in the code `< $ ^ & ? * ! # >` corresponds to a set of possible letters. For example, `<` can be R, C, A, S, or B.

2. **Determine Word Requirements:** The code must translate into two nine-letter English words that are opposites. The sample solution suggests ""Religious"" and ""Atheistic.""

3. **Map Symbols to ""Religious"":**
   - `<` → R (options: R, C, A, S, B)
   - `$` → E (options: T, E, N, I, H)
   - `^` → L (options: O, L, G, I, H)
   - `&` → I (options: J, I, E, P, K)
   - `?` → G (options: F, G, A, Q, I)
   - `*` → I (options: I, D, E, U, S)
   - `!` → O (options: T, E, O, Z, Y)
   - `#` → U (options: N, I, W, A, U)
   - `>` → S (options: L, S, N, C, E)

4. **Map Symbols to ""Atheistic"":**
   - `<` → A (options: R, C, A, S, B)
   - `$` → T (options: T, E, N, I, H)
   - `^` → H (options: O, L, G, I, H)
   - `&` → E (options: J, I, E, P, K)
   - `?` → I (options: F, G, A, Q, I)
   - `*` → S (options: I, D, E, U, S)
   - `!` → T (options: T, E, O, Z, Y)
   - `#` → I (options: N, I, W, A, U)
   - `>` → C (options: L, S, N, C, E)

5. **Verify Consistency:** Confirm that every symbol’s required letter for both words exists in its predefined options. All mappings align with the given constraints.

6. **Conclusion:** The code ambiguously represents both ""Religious"" and ""Atheistic"" by assigning different valid letters to each symbol, fulfilling the requirement of opposites. 

**Answer:** Religious and Atheistic.",True
45,"Question: MADADIA has been chosen to host the latest United Nations Kebab Annual Liaisons (U.N.K.A.L).
Madadia's mayoress, Madka Owdiseez, has invited several wives of delegates of UNKAL for an informal luncheon.
She plans to seat her 9 guests in a row such that each lady will be able to converse with the person directly to her left and right. She has prepared the following list.
Mrs. F speaks English only.
Mrs. G speaks English and French.
Mrs. H speaks English and Russian.
Mrs. J speaks Russian only.
Mrs. K speaks English only.
Mrs. L speaks French only.
Mrs. M speaks French and German.
Mrs. N speaks English and German.
Mrs. O speaks English only.
How many distinct seating arrangements are possible? Give all possible seating arrangements. Bear in mind that Madka Owdiseez is not one of the 9 to be seated in a row.
Note that ABCD and DCBA are the same
 Solution: With each arrangement considered identical to its reverse, there are 126 possible arrangements.
FKO are interchangeable, and can be arranged 6 ways. FKO stays together unless N is next to M outside GLM (more on that below).
JH must be together, and J must be at the end, because H is the only other Russian speaker. JH has 2 slots in the above configuration (H next to FKO, with J on the outside).
GLM has 1 slot in the above configuration (G next to FKO, opposite JH).
2[JH]*6[FKO]*1[MLG]=12 arrangements, or 2 mirror groups of 6 arrangements each. Thus, 6 distinct arrangements - 1 for each FKO order.
Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML. If N is between FKO and GLM, GLM can scramble, and G can be anywhere touching FKO, except N cannot touch L. When G-[L/M]-N are consecutive in either direction, FKO can straddle that subgroup. That makes 126 arrangements - 21 for each FKO order.
Here are the 21 arrangements, using xxx for the interchangeable FKO.

1. **Identify Fixed Pair (JH):**  
   Mrs. J (Russian only) must be seated next to Mrs. H (Russian/English) at one end. Due to the symmetry of the problem (reversed arrangements are identical), we fix JH at the left end, eliminating duplicate counts.

2. **English-Speaking Cluster (F, K, O):**  
   F, K, and O only speak English and are interchangeable. They form a flexible subgroup that can be permuted in **3! = 6 ways** (e.g., F-K-O, F-O-K, etc.), provided they remain adjacent to other English speakers.

3. **French-German Cluster (G, L, M):**  
   - Mrs. L (French only) must be adjacent to G (French/English) or M (French/German).  
   - G acts as a bridge between the English cluster and French speakers (L/M).  
   - M connects to N (German/English) via German.  
   - GLM permutations (e.g., G-L-M, G-M-L, M-L-G) depend on N’s placement.

4. **Placement of Mrs. N (English/German):**  
   - N can be inserted into 5 key positions:  
     - Within the FKO cluster (2 slots).  
     - Between FKO and H (1 slot).  
     - Between FKO and G (1 slot).  
     - Adjacent to M (1 slot).  
   - N’s position determines the flexibility of GLM permutations (e.g., GLM vs. GML).

5. **Generate Base Arrangements:**  
   - With JH fixed, N’s 5 placements and GLM permutations yield **21 distinct base configurations** (e.g., `JHNxxxGLM`, `JHxxxGNML`).  

6. **Account for FKO Permutations:**  
   - Each base configuration is multiplied by **6 permutations** of F, K, O.  
   - Total arrangements: **21 base configurations × 6 permutations = 126 distinct seating arrangements**.

**Answer:**  
The least number of distinct seating arrangements is **126**.",True

47,"Question: The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?
 Solution: ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**  
To determine the Neptunian Assassin, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Traits**: The assassin is the only one who is green, tentacled, and slimy.

2. **Analyze Clue 2**:  
   - Agurgle (Uranus) has two non-green neighbors.  
   - Since only the assassin is green, Agurgle must be in a middle position (2 or 3), with neighbors 1 & 3 or 2 & 4, all non-green.  

3. **Deduce Positions**:  
   - Assume Agurgle is in position 2.  
   - Neighbors 1 (Wym-Inar) and 3 (Mr. Arthur Johnson) are non-green.  
   - The assassin (green) must be in position 4 (ChimChim from Pluto).  

4. **Apply Clue 1**:  
   - Wym-Inar (position 1) has exactly one tentacled neighbor (Agurgle).  
   - Agurgle (position 2) is tentacled.  
   - Mr. Arthur Johnson (position 3) has two tentacled neighbors (Agurgle and ChimChim).  
   - ChimChim (position 4) has no tentacled neighbors.  
   - This satisfies Clue 1: Only Wym-Inar has one tentacled neighbor.  

5. **Apply Clue 3**:  
   - ChimChim (position 4) is slimy and adjacent to Mr. Arthur Johnson (slimy), giving ChimChim **0 Un-slimy neighbors**.  
   - Wym-Inar (Un-slimy) is adjacent to Agurgle (Un-slimy).  
   - Agurgle and Mr. Arthur Johnson each have **1 Un-slimy neighbor**.  
   - This satisfies Clue 3: ChimChim is the exception.  

6. **Verify All Clues**:  
   - **Clue 2**: Agurgle’s neighbors (positions 1 & 3) are non-green.  
   - **Clue 1**: Only Wym-Inar has one tentacled neighbor.  
   - **Clue 3**: ChimChim has 0 Un-slimy neighbors; others have 1.  

**CONCLUSION**:  
ChimChim from Pluto is the Neptunian Assassin, as they are green, tentacled, and slimy. NASA boffins do not let ChimChim out of the booth.

Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man.
Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Who is fair, handsome and unscarred?
 Solution: Cliff Hedge is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:

1. **Clue Analysis:**
   - **Clue 2** implies Mad Ade is positioned between two non-fair individuals (positions 2 or 3 in the line).
   - **Clue 1** restricts the fair, handsome, unscarred (F/H/¬S) trait to one person.
   - **Clue 3** identifies Buster Artery as the only person adjacent to exactly one handsome individual.
   - **Clue 4** states Cliff Hedge is the only person not adjacent to exactly one scarred individual.

2. **Case Elimination:**
   - **Case 1:** Assume Mad Ade is F/H/¬S. This forces his neighbors to be non-fair, but leads to contradictions with Clues 3 and 4 (e.g., Cliff Hedge would wrongly satisfy Clue 3).
   - **Case 2:** Assume the F/H/¬S person is at the line’s end (position 4). This aligns Mad Ade in position 2 with non-fair neighbors, satisfying Clue 2. Cliff Hedge, in position 4, becomes F/H/¬S.

3. **Adjacency Validation:**
   - **Clue 4:** Cliff Hedge (position 4) is adjacent to one non-scarred individual (position 3), fulfilling ""not adjacent to exactly one scarred.""
   - **Clue 3:** Buster Artery (position 1 or 3) is adjacent to exactly one handsome person (Mad Ade or Cliff), satisfying uniqueness.

4. **Final Configuration:**
   - Positions: [Non-fair, Mad Ade (non-fair), Non-fair, Cliff Hedge (F/H/¬S)].
   - Scarring/handsomeness assignments ensure all other clues hold true.

Note that it is only the ranking of the horses being found not the actual timings.
 Solution: Answer: 7 races
Race #1 to Race #5 - Divide the horses into 5 groups of 5. Race each group to rank the first 3 in each - that's 5 races.
Race #6 - Race the winner from each group. The winner in this race is the fastest horse.
Race #7 - Race the second and third horses from the race in which the fastest horse raced initially,
the first and second horses from the group of the second horse in Race #6, and the third horse in Race #6 (that's a total of 5 horses).

1. **Initial Group Races (Races 1-5):**  
   - Divide the 25 horses into 5 groups of 5.  
   - Race each group. Record the top 3 finishers in each group (since only these could potentially be in the global top 3).  
   - **Total races: 5.**

2. **Determine the Fastest Horse (Race 6):**  
   - Race the 5 group winners from the first round.  
   - The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.  
   - **Total races: 6.**

3. **Identify Candidates for Second and Third Place (Race 7):**  
   - The horses that could be second or third globally are:  
     - The 2nd and 3rd place finishers from the fastest horse’s original group (they might be faster than other group winners).  
     - The 1st and 2nd place finishers from the group whose winner came second in Race 6 (they might be faster than the third-place group winner).  
     - The 1st place finisher from the group whose winner came third in Race 6.  
   - Race these 5 horses. The top two in this race are the second and third fastest overall.  
   - **Total races: 7.**

**Key Logic:**  
- After Race 6, only horses from the first three groups in Race 6 and their immediate competitors need to be considered. Horses from groups with winners ranked fourth or fifth in Race 6 cannot be in the top 3.  
- The seventh race resolves ambiguities between the remaining candidates, ensuring the correct second and third places are determined.

50,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Solution: 1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.
4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.
5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.
10) Check both machines that were active and are now turned off. The one that is warmer is connected to switch B (since it was on most recently), and the cooler one is connected to switch C (which was turned off first).
11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside.

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   - Turn off two machines using their internal switches inside the room. These become ""inactive,"" while the remaining three are ""active.""

2. **Identify Active/Inactive Switches:**  
   - From outside, test combinations of turning off three switches. The correct combination (which silences the active machines) identifies the three active switches (A, B, C). The remaining two (D, E) control inactive machines.

3. **Map Active Switches to Machines:**  
   - Turn on switches A and B, leave C off. Wait for the machine connected to C to cool. Turn off B.  
   - Re-enter the room:  
     - The running machine is connected to A.  
     - The warmer stopped machine is B (recently off), and the cooler one is C (off longer).

4. **Map Inactive Switches to Machines:**  
   - Turn on switch E and leave D off. Reactivate the inactive machines’ internal switches inside the room.  
     - The machine that starts is connected to E.  
     - The non-starting machine is connected to D.

**Logical Steps:**  
1. Use sound to isolate active switches by silencing the room.  
2. Use temperature differences to distinguish recently turned-off machines.  
3. Reactivate inactive machines with known external switch states to finalize mappings.  
This method leverages both auditory and thermal feedback to uniquely identify each switch-machine pair.",True

1. **Understand the Constraints:** Each queen must occupy a unique row, column, and diagonal. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or have a diagonal distance where the row and column differences are equal.

2. **Row-by-Row Placement:** Since there are 8 rows and 8 queens, place one queen per row. This reduces the problem to selecting a unique column for each row (i.e., a permutation of columns 1–8).

3. **Check Column Conflicts:** For each new queen, ensure its column is not already occupied by a previously placed queen.

4. **Check Diagonal Conflicts:** For a queen placed at position \((r, c)\), ensure no other queen at \((r', c')\) satisfies \(|r - r'| = |c - c'|\). This eliminates diagonal threats.

5. **Backtracking Method:** Systematically place queens row by row. If a conflict arises, backtrack to the previous row and try the next valid column. Repeat until all queens are placed without conflicts.

6. **Example Solution Construction:**  
   - **Row 1:** Place queen at \(a1\) (column 1).  
   - **Row 2:** Avoid columns 1 and 2 (blocked by \(a1\) diagonally). Place at \(g2\) (column 7).  
   - **Row 3:** Avoid columns 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 (blocked diagonally/vertically). Place at \(e3\) (column 5).  
   - **Row 4:** Avoid columns 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place at \(h4\) (column 8).  
   - **Row 5:** Avoid columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. Place at \(b5\) (column 2).  
   - **Row 6:** Avoid columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place at \(d6\) (column 4).  
   - **Row 7:** Avoid columns 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Place at \(f7\) (column 6).  
   - **Row 8:** Only remaining column is \(c8\) (column 3), which is safe.  

7. **Verification:** Confirm no two queens share a row, column, or diagonal. For example, \(a1\) and \(g2\) differ by 1 row and 6 columns, so \(|1-2| \neq |1-7|\), satisfying the diagonal constraint.

**ANSWER:**  
One valid arrangement is placing queens at **a1, g2, e3, h4, b5, d6, f7, c8** (as in the first example solution). This ensures no two queens threaten each other by sharing a row, column, or diagonal.",True

 Solution: Alan Thompson, Liar
Boris Paley, liar
Chuck Thomson, truthteller
Dalman Paley, liar
Edwin Paley, truthteller
Finney Thomson, truthteller
Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.

Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.

1. **Identify Boris as a liar:**  
   Boris's claim that both his brothers tell the truth is impossible, as it would make his family all truth-tellers. Thus, Boris lies and is a Paley (from Finney's truthful statement).

2. **Determine Finney's truthfulness:**  
   If Finney lies, Edwin would also be a liar (contradicting the three-truth-teller requirement). Thus, Finney tells the truth:  
   - Finney is a Thomson.  
   - Edwin is truthful (validating Edwin's claim that he and Boris are brothers, making Edwin a Paley).  
   - Boris is a Paley (as per Finney's second statement).

3. **Assign remaining Paleys and Thomsons:**  
   - Paleys: Boris (liar), Edwin (truth), and one more.  
   - Dalman lies about being Chuck's brother, so he is the third Paley (liar).  
   - Thomsons: Alan, Chuck, and Finney.  

4. **Resolve Alan and Chuck's status:**  
   - Chuck truthfully states Alan and Boris are liars, making Chuck a truthful Thomson.  
   - Alan, a Thomson, falsely claims both his brothers (Chuck and Finney) are liars, confirming Alan as a liar.

54,"Question: A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?
 Solution: At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:

1. **Initial Calculation Misconception:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate total water loss as \(13 \text{ locks} \times 7,000 \text{ L/lock} = 91,000 \text{ L}\). Compare this to the truck’s capacity (\(22 \text{ tons} = 22,000 \text{ L}\)).  
   - **Step 2:** Conclude the truck’s 22,000 L is insufficient to offset 91,000 L loss, making the contract unreasonable.  

2. **Correct Hydraulic Analysis:**
   - **Step 3:** Recognize that each lock transfers water from the upper pound to the lower pound. When a boat traverses all 13 locks upward, the **topmost pound** loses \(7,000 \text{ L}\) (not cumulative).  
   - **Step 4:** The total loss per boat transit is \(7,000 \text{ L}\), not \(91,000 \text{ L}\).  

3. **Revised Net Gain:**
   - **Step 5:** Subtract the single transit loss from the truck’s capacity:  
     \(22,000 \text{ L (truck)} - 7,000 \text{ L (loss)} = 15,000 \text{ L net gain}\).  
   - **Step 6:** Conclude the contract is reasonable because the truck replenishes more water than is lost.  

4. **Engineering and Economic Considerations (Ancillary):**
   - **Step 7:** Acknowledge potential losses from evaporation, leaks, or time delays (not quantified in the problem).  
   - **Step 8:** Suggest coordination (e.g., simultaneous up/down traffic) to minimize losses, but these are secondary to the core hydraulic logic.  

**CONCLUSION:**  
The contract is reasonable because the truck’s 22,000 L compensates for the **7,000 L loss** from the top pound during a single transit, resulting in a **15,000 L surplus**. The initial misconception of multiplying losses per lock is incorrect due to the cascading nature of water transfer in locks.",True

1. X is 3.
2. If X is 2, then the following statement is false.

5. X is a square number.
6. If X is less than 3, then the previous statement is false.
7. If X is greater than 2, then the previous statement is false.
Which statements are true?
 Solution: If X is 2, then statements 2 and 3 create a paradox. Therefore, X is not 2, so statements 2 and 3 are both true because the ""if"" part is not satisfied.
Therefore, statement 6 must be true, because if X is less than 3, we know X must be 2. In this case, statement 5 is false.
However, because statement 6 is true, there are at least 3 true statements, meaning we can't conclude if statement 5 is false based on this statement alone.
Statement 7 is false because X is definitely greater than 2, and the previous statement was true.
Statement 1 and 4 must be false, because their truth will imply their falseness.
For example, if statement 4 was true, then it won't be satisfied anymore (as there are at least 4 statements true), so it can't be true.
But statement 5 must then be true, else statements 1 and 4 will become true.

However, because statement 6 is true, there are at least 3 true statements, meaning we can't conclude if statement 5 is false based on this statement alone.
Statement 7 is false because X is definitely greater than 2, and the previous statement was true.

1. **Identify Possible Values for X:**  
   X is the number of true statements (1-7). Possible values are 0-7. Statement 5 (X is a square number) limits X to 0, 1, 4. Eliminate 0 (contradicts itself) and 1 (leads to inconsistency with other statements).

2. **Analyze X=4:**  
   - Statement 5 (X=4 is a square) is **true**.  
   - Statement 4 (X<4) is **false** (since X=4).  
   - Statements 2 and 3: Both conditions assume X=2 (false), making them **true** (implications with false premises).  
   - Statement 6: ""If X<3, then statement 5 is false."" X=4 invalidates the premise, so **true**.  
   - Statement 7: ""If X>2, then statement 6 is false."" X=4>2, but statement 6 is true, so **false**.  
   - Statement 1 (X=3) is **false**.  

3. **Verify Consistency:**  
   True statements are 2, 3, 5, 6 (total of 4), matching X=4. No contradictions arise.

4. **Eliminate Other Values:**  
   - X=2 creates a paradox between statements 2 and 3.  
   - X=3 leads to more than 3 true statements.  
   - Higher values (5-7) are inconsistent with the true statement count.

**Final Answer:**  
Statements **2, 3, 5, and 6** are true.",True

She is very protective over her precious cats and, hence, has a high-tech alarm system which requires a 10-digit code to deactivate it. Unfortunately, you have forgotten the code to disarm the alarm! Oddly however, you remember some mathematical facts about them...
Can you figure it out in time to feed the hungry cats?!?
* Each digit from 0 to 9 is used once only in the code.
* The sum of the numbers in the 3rd and 4th positions is equal to the product of the numbers in the 6th and 9th positions.
* The product of the numbers in the 5th and 10th positions is odd.
* The 2nd number (i.e. the number in the 2nd position) is larger than the 5th, which is larger than the 7th.
* The 8th number is larger than the 6th, which is larger than the 2nd.
* The sum of the 2nd, 6th, and 9th numbers is a perfect square.

1. **Identify Constraints on Odd Positions:**
   - The 5th and 10th digits must be odd and distinct. Possible pairs: (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (1,9), (3,1), (3,5), (3,7), (3,9), (5,1), (5,3), (5,7), (5,9).  
   - From **pos8 > pos6 > pos2**, deduce **pos5 ≤ 5** (since pos8 must be ≤9). This narrows **pos5** to 1, 3, or 5.

2. **Analyze pos5 = 1:**
   - **pos7 = 0** (since **pos5 > pos7**).  
   - **pos1 = pos10 - 1** (from **pos1 + pos5 = pos7 + pos10**).  
   - Test **pos10 = 9** (the largest odd digit):  
     - **pos1 = 8** (since 9 - 1 = 8).  
     - **pos4 + pos9 = 9** (from **pos4 + pos9 = pos10**). **pos9** must be even (2, 4, 6).  
     - Valid pair: **pos9 = 4**, **pos4 = 5** (5 + 4 = 9).  

3. **Apply Constraints to Remaining Positions:**
   - **pos3 + pos4 = pos6 × pos9**: Substitute **pos3 = 4×pos6 - 5**.  
   - **pos2 > pos5 = 1** and **pos8 > pos6 > pos2**. Test **pos2 = 2**:  
     - **pos6 = 3** (next available digit >2).  
     - **pos3 = 7** (4×3 - 5 = 7).  
     - **pos8 = 6** (remaining digit > pos6 =3).  

4. **Verify All Conditions:**
   - **Sum of pos2, pos6, pos9 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9** (perfect square).  
   - **pos8 = 6 > pos6 = 3 > pos2 = 2**.  
   - All digits (0-9) are used uniquely.

2. Solve for **pos7 = 0** and **pos1 = 8** using constraints.  
3. Determine **pos9 = 4** and **pos4 = 5** from their sum equaling **pos10 = 9**.  
4. Derive **pos3 = 7** and **pos6 = 3** using the product-sum equivalence.  
5. Assign remaining digits (**pos2 = 2**, **pos8 = 6**) to satisfy inequalities and uniqueness.  
6. Confirm all constraints are met, resulting in the unique valid code.",True
57,"Question: There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?
 Solution: Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.","2 Hints:

1. **Initial Bids and Revised Offer:**
   - Company A bid $800,000, while Company B initially asked for $1,000,000.
   - Contractor B restructured their offer: The Emperor could pay $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000, depending on the outcome of a phased construction process.

2. **Phased Construction Proposal:**
   - Both companies would build the first 25% of the bridge from opposite ends, each paid $200,000 for their initial work.
   - After evaluating the quality of both 25% segments, the Emperor would choose one company to complete the remaining 75%.

3. **Payment Structure for Completion:**
   - If Company A was chosen, they would receive an additional $600,000 (total $800,000: $200K + $600K).
   - If Company B was chosen, they would receive an additional $750,000 (total $950,000: $200K + $750K).
   - This made the offer seem competitive, as the Emperor could theoretically pay less than $1,000,000.

4. **Company A's Withdrawal:**
   - Company A realized their inferior quality would likely lose them the completion phase, making the $200,000 initial payment unprofitable.
   - They withdrew entirely to avoid losses, leaving the Emperor with no alternative but to award the full contract to Company B.

5. **Outcome:**
   - With no competition, the Emperor had to pay Company B’s original full price of $1,000,000.
   - Contractor B’s honesty was preserved: The offer was valid only if both companies participated. Company A’s withdrawal voided the phased plan, necessitating the full payment.

**Logical Flow:**  
The phased offer created a risk for Company A, incentivizing their withdrawal. This left the Emperor no choice but to accept Company B’s highest bid, fulfilling the contractual terms without deception.",True
58,"Question: A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?
 Solution: There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of friends (initially) and \( N \) be the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially. Total tokens = \( G \times N \).

2. **Family Division Equation:**
   - If divided by families, there are \( G - 2 \) families (since two groups of sisters reduce the count by 2). Each family gets \( N + 5 \) tokens. Thus:
     \[
     G \times N = (N + 5)(G - 2)
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     2N = 5G - 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad N = \frac{5G - 10}{2}
     \]
   - \( G \) must be even (to make \( N \) an integer) and less than 10.

3. **Check Possible Values for \( G \):**
   - Test even \( G \): 2, 4, 6, 8.
     - \( G = 6 \): \( N = \frac{5(6) - 10}{2} = 10 \). Valid since \( N = 10 \) is divisible by \( G - 1 = 5 \).

4. **Verify Divisibility Constraints:**
   - Total tokens = \( 6 \times 10 = 60 \).
     - Divisible by \( G = 6 \), \( G - 2 = 4 \), and \( G - 1 = 5 \).
   - Family division: \( 60 \div 4 = 15 \) tokens/family (\( N + 5 = 15 \), consistent).
   - After Wendy leaves: \( 10 \) tokens split among \( 5 \) friends, each gets \( 10 + 2 = 12 \).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - **Number of Friends:** 6 (originally).
   - **Tokens per Friend:** 12 (after redistribution, excluding Wendy).

**ANSWER:**  
There were **6 friends**, and each friend ended up with **12 Golden kebab tokens**.",True

At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?
 Solution: -You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field

1. **Establish Kvakk's and Quack's Positions:**
   - Clue 10 places Quack's house east of Kvakk's. 
   - Clue 1 states two gardens lie between them on the shortest route (Kvakk → Garden1 → Garden2 → Quack). 
   - Clue 5 excludes The Field, The Forest, Angel’s Valley, or Star from this path. Clue 7 links Quack to Duck Country and The Forest. Since the shortest path avoids The Forest, the two intermediate gardens must be **The Pool** and **Duck Country** (Kvakk → The Pool → Duck Country → Quack).

2. **Position Flower-Heaven Relative to Quack:**
   - Clue 11 places flower-heaven southwest of Quack. 
   - Clue 9 specifies two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven, distinct from those between Kvakk and Quack. These gardens are **The Forest** and **Angel’s Valley** (Quack → The Forest → Angel’s Valley → flower-heaven).

3. **Identify Connections to Flower-Heaven:**
   - Clue 13 allows three entry points to flower-heaven. 
   - Clue 3 links The Field to flower-heaven via one garden (**Longo**). 
   - Clue 6 connects The Forest to The Mountain via **Longo**, and Clue 14 links Star to The Mountain. Thus, flower-heaven is adjacent to **Longo**, **The Mountain**, and **Angel’s Valley**.

4. **Determine the Shortest Route:**
   - From Kvakk’s house, Clue 8 connects directly to **The Field**. 
   - The Field connects to **Longo** (Clue 8), which leads directly to flower-heaven (Clue 3). 
   - This creates the path: **Kvakk’s House → The Field → Longo → Flower-Heaven**, passing through **two gardens** (The Field and Longo), the minimal number possible.

61,"Question: In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?
 Solution: The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison.

1. **Treasurer's Initial Plan:**
   - The treasurer, knowing he can't create a stronger poison, pre-drinks a **weak poison** before the meeting. 
   - He plans to bring **water** (disguised as poison) to the test. 

2. **Intended Outcome of Treasurer's Plan:**
   - During the test, he drinks the pharmacist’s strong poison first, which **neutralizes his pre-consumed weak poison** (since the strong poison overpowers the weak one). 
   - He then drinks his own “poison” (water), surviving. 
   - The pharmacist would drink the treasurer’s water (no effect) followed by his own strong poison, leading to his death. 

3. **Pharmacist’s Counterplan:**
   - Anticipating the treasurer’s trick, the pharmacist also brings **water** as his “poison”. 

4. **Actual Outcome:**
   - The treasurer drinks the pharmacist’s water (no effect) and his own water (no effect), **failing to neutralize the weak poison he pre-drank**. He dies from the weak poison. 
   - The pharmacist drinks the treasurer’s water and his own water, surviving unharmed. 
   - The king receives no strong poison, as both brought water. 

**Key Logic:**  
The treasurer’s survival depended on neutralizing his pre-consumed weak poison with the pharmacist’s strong poison. By substituting water, the pharmacist ensured the treasurer’s weak poison remained active, causing his death.",True
62,"Question: Edgar, Frank, and George are regulars at a pub. All three of them have been regulars since before this month.
1. One regular goes to the pub every two days, one goes every three days, and one goes every seven days.
2. The first day of a certain month that Edgar went to the bar was a Monday. The first day of the same month that Frank went to the bar was a Wednesday. The first day of the same month that George went to the bar was a Friday.
3. There was only one day in that month that all three men went to the pub.
On which day of that month did all three men go to the bar?
 Solution: All three men went on the 27th.
From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd.

1. **Assign Intervals to Individuals:**
   - Edgar, Frank, and George have intervals of 2, 3, and 7 days. Their first visits in the month are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, respectively.

2. **Determine Starting Dates:**
   - The 2-day interval individual cannot start on a day adjacent to the 3-day individual’s start date (to avoid overlaps). This eliminates scenarios where their first visits are on consecutive days.
   - **Scenario 1 (Invalid):** Assume Edgar (2-day) starts on Monday (1st), Frank (3-day) on Wednesday (3rd), George (7-day) on Friday (5th). This results in no common day for all three.
   - **Scenario 2 (Valid):** Assign Frank as the 2-day individual starting Wednesday (1st), George as the 3-day individual starting Friday (3rd), and Edgar as the 7-day individual starting Monday (6th).

3. **List Visit Days for Each:**
   - **Frank (2-day):** 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31.

63,"Question: The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.
 Solution: The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.

1. **Analyze Common Clues:**
   - Each team has 4 prime runs (2,3,7,11), 2 perfect squares (0,4,9), and 1 even non-prime/square run (6,8,10,12).
   - Only one shutout (0 runs) exists. The team with 0 must have another square (4 or 9).
   - Each team has 3 even-run games (from clue [2]).

2. **Determine Team Configurations:**
   - **Reds (36 runs):** To satisfy clue [7] (two pairs summing to 9), their runs include 0,9,2,3,3,7,12. This gives pairs (0,9) and (2,7).
   - **Tigers (30 runs):** Without a 0, their squares are 4,4, primes are 3,3,3,7, and 7th game 6. Runs: 3,3,3,4,4,6,7.

3. **Compare Game Wins:**
   - Pair Tigers' highest runs against Reds' lowest to maximize wins:
     - Tigers' 7 > 0, 6 > 2, 4 > 3, 4 > 3 → 4 wins.
     - Reds' 7,9,12 > Tigers' remaining 3s → 3 wins.

1. **Identify Statement Pairs:**  
   Statements are grouped in pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10) where each pair refers to the maximum number of ""True"" or ""False"" answers. These pairs cannot both be true (e.g., if ""True ≤1"" is true, ""False ≤1"" must be false because there are 10 total statements).

2. **Analyze Contradictions:**  
   - Statements 7 (""True ≤4"") and 10 (""False ≤5"") conflict because if ""True ≤4,"" then ""False ≥6,"" making 10 false.  
   - Statements 8 (""False ≤4"") and 9 (""True ≤5"") conflict because ""False ≤4"" implies ""True ≥6,"" contradicting ""True ≤5.""

65,"Question: The Antisocial Club meets every week at Jim's Bar.  Since they are so antisocial, however, everyone always sits as far as possible from the other members, and no one ever sits right next to another member.  Because of this, the 25-stool bar is almost always less than half full and unfortunately for Jim the members that don't sit at the bar don't order any drinks.  Jim, however, is pretty smart and makes up a new rule:  The first person to sit at the bar has to sit at one of two particular stools.  If this happens, then the maximum number of members will sit at the bar.  Which stools must be chosen?  Assume the stools are numbered 1 to 25 and are arranged in a straight line.
 Solution: The first person must take either stool 9 or 17 (because of symmetry, it doesn't matter which).  Assume they pick seat 9.  The next person will pick seat 25, since it is the furthest from seat 9.  The next two people will take Seats one and 17.  The next three will occupy 5, 13, and 21.  The next six will occupy 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 23.  This seats the maximum of 13 people, and no one is sitting next to another person.

1. **Understand the Goal:** Determine the first two stools (9 and 17) that allow seating the maximum of 13 people, ensuring no two are adjacent.  
2. **Optimal Starting Point:** The first person must split the 25-stool line into segments that can be recursively filled symmetrically. Starting at **9** or **17** (midpoints of the bar's left and right halves) creates balanced segments.  
3. **Seating Sequence:**  
   - **First person** sits at **9**, splitting the bar into **1–8** and **10–25**.  
   - **Second person** takes **25** (farthest from 9).  
   - **Third and fourth** take **1** (farthest from 9 and 25) and **17** (midpoint of 10–25).  
   - Subsequent people fill midpoints of the largest gaps: **5, 13, 21**, then **3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23**.  
4. **Avoid Blocking:** Each choice maximizes the minimum distance to occupied seats, ensuring no adjacency. Starting elsewhere (e.g., center or edges) creates asymmetric segments, reducing the total to fewer than 13.  
5. **Result:** Starting at **9** or **17** systematically partitions the bar, allowing 13 non-adjacent seats. Other starting points disrupt this symmetry, leading to suboptimal arrangements.

67,"Question: A road leading to a secret military base is 20 feet wide. Private Roberts was ordered to plant 20 land mines on the road in a 20-foot by 20-foot area. He laid out the area in a grid, with 100 2-foot squares arranged in 10 columns (running parallel with the road) and 10 rows (running perpendicular with the road).  He planted each land mine within a square on the grid so that there were exactly two mines in each row and two in each column. When he was finished, he found himself on the wrong side of the minefield, and he couldn't get back to the base without crossing the minefield.
He labeled the columns A-J from left to right, and numbered the rows 1-10 starting with the row closest to the base.

He could remember the following facts about where the mines were planted:
1. There was no mine in any of the four corners.
2. Row 10 was the only row where the two mines were next to each other.
3. The two mines in column C were in the same rows as the two mines in column H.
4. One of the mines in column B was in row 7.
5. In row 9, there were 3 empty squares between the two mines.
6. Both mines in column E were in row 5 or higher.
7. One of the mines in column I was in row 9 or 10.
8. Both mines in column H were in odd number rows.
9. The two mines in column D were in the same rows as the two mines in column J.
10. One of the mines in column A was in row 5.
Can you find a safe path to the other side of the mine field moving one square at a time (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), starting in row 10 and moving through row one?

A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.

       3. Unreliable (lying) → Bob is truth-teller or liar.  
     - **Second Question:** Ask Alex, ""Is Bob the liar?""  
       - **""Yes"" to both:**  
         - Alex is liar (Bob = truth-teller) or unreliable (Bob = liar).  
       - **""Yes"" then ""No"":**  
         - Alex is truth-teller (Bob = unreliable) or unreliable (Bob = truth-teller).  

   - **""No"" Answer:**  
     - Alex could be:  
       1. Truth-teller → Bob is liar.  
       2. Liar → Bob is unreliable.  
       3. Unreliable (truthful) → Bob is truth-teller or liar.  
     - **Second Question:** Ask Alex, ""Is Bob the truth-teller?""  
       - **""No"" to both:**  
         - Alex is truth-teller (Bob = liar) or unreliable (Bob = truth-teller).  
       - **""No"" then ""Yes"":**  
         - Alex is liar (Bob = unreliable) or unreliable (Bob = liar).  

2. **Analyze Responses to First Two Questions:**  
   - **Case A (Both ""Yes""):**  
     - Alex = liar (Bob = truth-teller) or unreliable (Bob = liar).  
     - **Third Question:** Ask Bob, ""Is Alex the truth-teller?""  
       - **""Yes"" →** Alex unreliable, Bob liar, Chuck truth-teller.  
       - **""No"" →** Alex liar, Bob truth-teller, Chuck unreliable.  

   - **Case B (Both ""No""):**  
     - Alex = truth-teller (Bob = liar) or unreliable (Bob = truth-teller).  
     - **Third Question:** Ask Bob, ""Is Alex the liar?""  
       - **""Yes"" →** Alex truth-teller, Bob liar, Chuck unreliable.  
       - **""No"" →** Alex unreliable, Bob truth-teller, Chuck liar.  

   - **Case C (""Yes"" then ""No""):**  
     - Alex = truth-teller (Bob = unreliable) or unreliable (Bob = truth-teller).  
     - **Third Question:** Ask Chuck, ""Is Alex the truth-teller?""  
       - **""Yes"" →** Alex unreliable, Bob truth-teller, Chuck liar.  
       - **""No"" →** Alex truth-teller, Bob unreliable, Chuck liar.  

   - **Case D (""No"" then ""Yes""):**  
     - Alex = liar (Bob = unreliable) or unreliable (Bob = liar).  
     - **Third Question:** Ask Chuck, ""Is Alex the liar?""  
       - **""Yes"" →** Alex liar, Bob unreliable, Chuck truth-teller.  
       - **""No"" →** Alex unreliable, Bob liar, Chuck truth-teller.  

3. **Final Determination:**  
   - Each third question leverages the known behavior of the responder (truth-teller/liar/unreliable) to resolve ambiguities.  
   - By systematically eliminating possibilities through the three questions, the roles of Alex, Bob, and Chuck are conclusively identified.  

**Logical Steps:**  
1. Use the first question to narrow down Bob’s role relative to Alex.  
2. Use the second question to test consistency (for unreliable’s alternation) or confirm roles.  
3. Use the third question to force a definitive answer from the remaining candidate, resolving all ambiguities.",True
71,"Question: Mad Ade is once again babysitting for family. The devil's spawn...er...three year old nephew he is watching is playing with some painted wooden blocks that have letters on the side, much like they did in teaser #15201.
Once again there are four blocks, each with a different letter on each side, making a total of 24 letters altogether.
Mad Ade noticed that the devil's...er...his nephew managed to make the following words from the four blocks.
BOXY,
BUCK,
CHAW,
DIGS,
EXAM,
FLIT,
GIRL,
JUMP,
OGRE,
OKAY,
PAWN,
ZEST
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Solution: Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.

Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.

From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.

1. **Identify Constraints from Each Word:** Each word uses four distinct blocks. For example, in ""EXAM,"" E, X, A, M must be on separate blocks.  
   - **EXAM**: E, X, A, M → different blocks.  
   - **OGRE**: O, G, R, E → different blocks.  
   - **OKAY**: O, K, A, Y → different blocks.  

2. **Assign A, E, O to Different Blocks:**  
   - From ""EXAM,"" ""OGRE,"" and ""OKAY,"" deduce **A**, **E**, **O** must be on distinct blocks. Assume:  
     - **A** → Block 1,  
     - **E** → Block 2,  
     - **O** → Block 3.  

3. **Place Letters Based on Word Overlaps:**  
   - **BOXY**: B (Block 1), O (Block 3), X (Block 4), Y (Block 2).  
   - **OKAY**: K → Block 4 (since A, O, Y are on 1, 3, 2).  
   - **BUCK**: U (Block 2), C (Block 3) (as B, K are on 1, 4).  
   - **PAWN**: W (Block 2), N (Block 3), P (Block 4).  
   - **JUMP**: J (Block 1), U (Block 2), M (Block 3), P (Block 4).  

4. **Resolve Remaining Letters:**  
   - **CHAW**: H → Block 4 (A on 1, W on 2, C on 3).  
   - **ZEST**: Z → Block 3, T → Block 4 (E on 2, S on 1).  
   - **GIRL**: G → Block 4, R → Block 1, L → Block 2, I → Block 3.  
   - **FLIT**: F → Block 1, L → Block 2, I → Block 3, T → Block 4.  
   - **DIGS**: D → Block 2, S → Block 1.  

5. **Final Block Assignments:**  
   - **Block 1**: A, B, F, J, R, S.  
   - **Block 2**: D, E, L, U, W, Y.  
   - **Block 3**: C, I, M, N, O, Z.  
   - **Block 4**: G, H, K, P, T, X.

72,"Question: You have:
- two 10-liter jugs, full of water
- one 9-liter jug, empty
- two large pools, empty
Your objective is to end up having 4 liters of water in each pool, and one liter of water in the 9-liter jug.
You have nothing else at your disposal and you can not measure using eye or shape of jugs. You can not pour water from pools, only into them.
 Solution: Label the 10-liter jugs as A and B, the 9-liter jug as C, and the two pools as Pa and Pb. The problem can be solved in 33 steps, as shown below. Each step is shown in one row, starting with the step number, followed by the jug we poured water from, then the quantity of water, then the jug/pool we poured water into... i.e. A ->( 1)-> Pb means we poured 1 liter of water from jug A (being 1st 10-liter jug)  to pool Pb  (being 2nd pool). Finally in the row we show how much water we have in each jug/pool after performing this step.

1. **Initialize the Jugs and Pools:**  
   - Start with both 10-liter jugs (A and B) full, 9-liter jug (C) empty, and pools (Pa, Pb) empty.

2. **Transfer 9 Liters to C and Begin Filling Pa:**  
   - Pour 9L from A to C (A=1, C=9).  
   - Pour 1L from A to Pa (A=0, Pa=1).  
   - Empty C into A (A=9, C=0).  
   - Pour 9L from B to C (B=1, C=9).  
   - Pour 1L from B to Pa (B=0, Pa=2).  

3. **Cycle to Build Pa to 4 Liters:**  
   - Transfer water between jugs to create 1L remainders and add them to Pa.  
     - Example: Pour 1L from C to A (A=10, C=8), then pour 8L from C to B. Repeat similar steps to increment Pa to 3, then 4 liters.  

4. **Start Filling Pb Using Same Method:**  
   - After Pa reaches 4L, shift focus to Pb.  
   - Use remaining water in A and B to create 1L increments for Pb:  
     - Pour 1L from A to Pb (step 17: Pb=1).  
     - Continue transfers to increment Pb to 2, 3, and finally 4 liters.  

5. **Adjust Final Quantities in Jugs:**  
   - Ensure 1L remains in C by transferring excess to B:  
     - Pour 8L from C to B (step 33: B=10, C=1).  

**Key Logic:**  
- Use the 9-liter jug (C) to transfer water between the 10-liter jugs (A and B), leaving 1L remainders.  
- Each 1L remainder is added to a pool (Pa or Pb) until both reach 4L.  
- Final transfers ensure C retains exactly 1L.  

**Result:**  
After 33 steps, pools Pa and Pb each hold 4L, and jug C holds 1L.  
**Minimum Steps:** 33.  
**Final State:** A=1L, B=10L, C=1L, Pa=4L, Pb=4L (as required).",True

5. The number of the 3rd place winner's board is at least 10 higher or at least 10 lower than that of Mr. Baird.
6. The number of the board of the contestant who placed immediately after Bert is exactly 15 higher than the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately before Tom.
7. The lowest board number of the top 4 finishers was exactly half the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately after the one who played the Giuoco Piano opening.
8. The highest board number was exactly 8 higher than the board number of the man who finished exactly two places after Bert.
 Solution: Firstly, work out the board numbers. We know that Bert finished in the first 2 (Clue 8) and board 31 finished in the last 2 (Clue 4). Using all combinations of these, we can eliminate all but the correct numbers, ie 16, 31, 32 and 40.

Fourth: Larry Hart, King's Indian, board 32",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Determine Board Numbers:**
   - Clue 4: Mr. Rose is 2 places ahead of board 31. Since there are 4 places, Mr. Rose must be 1st (board 31 is 3rd) or 2nd (board 31 is 4th). The solution assumes Mr. Rose is 1st, making board 31 = 3rd place.
   - Clue 8: The highest board (40) is 8 higher than the board of the player two places after Bert. If Bert is 2nd, the player two places after is 4th (32). Thus, 40 = 32 + 8.
   - Clue 7: The lowest board (16) is half the board of the player after the Giuoco Piano user. The next player after Giuoco Piano (3rd place on 31) is 4th place on 32 (16 × 2 = 32).
   - Clue 6: The board after Bert (3rd place: 31) is 15 higher than the board before Tom (2nd place: 16). 31 - 16 = 15.
   - **Boards confirmed:** 16 (2nd), 31 (3rd), 32 (4th), 40 (1st).

2. **Assign Names and Openings:**
   - Clue 1: Mr. Hart uses King’s Indian → 4th place (Larry Hart, board 32).
   - Clue 3: Top 4 include Larry, Mr. Korn, Queen’s Gambit, and an even board. Queen’s Gambit assigned to 1st place (Steve Rose, board 40).
   - Clue 2: Steve (1st) is ahead of Ruy Lopez user → Ruy Lopez assigned to 2nd place (Bert Baird, board 16).
   - Remaining opening (Giuoco Piano) and last name (Korn) assigned to 3rd place (Tom Korn, board 31).

3. **Verify Consistency:**
   - Clue 5: 3rd place’s board (31) is 15 away from Mr. Baird’s board (16) → 31 - 16 = 15 (≥10).
   - All placements, names, openings, and boards align with all clues.

**Final Answer:**
- **1st:** Steve Rose, Queen’s Gambit, Board 40  
- **2nd:** Bert Baird, Ruy Lopez, Board 16  
- **3rd:** Tom Korn, Giuoco Piano, Board 31  
- **4th:** Larry Hart, King’s Indian, Board 32",True

76,"Question: With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?
 Solution: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

1. **Define Hand Movements:**
   - The swapped hour hand moves at 6° per minute (minute hand speed) starting from 6 (180°).
   - The swapped minute hand moves at 0.5° per minute (hour hand speed) starting from 6 (180°).
   - The correct hour hand moves at 0.5° per minute from 6 (180°).
   - The correct minute hand moves at 6° per minute from 12 (0°).

2. **Equations for Alignment:**
   - **Hour Hands Align:** The swapped (fast) and correct (slow) hour hands align when the fast laps the slow by 360°:
     \[
     6t - 0.5t = 360° \implies 5.5t = 360° \implies t = \frac{720}{11} \text{ minutes (65 5/11)}.
     \]
   - **Minute Hands Align:** The correct (fast) minute hand catches the swapped (slow) minute hand starting 180° behind:
     \[
     6t - 0.5t = 180° \implies 5.5t = 180° \implies t = \frac{360}{11} \text{ minutes (32 8/11)}.
     \]

3. **Find Common Time:**
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of \(\frac{720}{11}\) and \(\frac{360}{11}\) is \(\frac{720}{11}\) minutes.
   - Convert \(\frac{720}{11}\) minutes to hours: \(1\) hour and \(5 \frac{5}{11}\) minutes.

4. **Result:**
   - The first correct time occurs at \(6:00 + 1\text{ hr }5 \frac{5}{11}\text{ min} = 7:05 \frac{5}{11}\).

78,"Question: Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.
 Solution: Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

3. **Clue 4 (Column I - Equal Intervals):**  
   - **Arithmetic Sequence:** Column I must form an arithmetic progression. The only valid sequence with one multiple of 6 (clue 10) is 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 (common difference = 1).  

4. **Clue 5 (Column O - Unequal Intervals):**  
   - **Intervals Differ:** Column O must have increasing differences. The sequence 61, 63, 66, 70, 75 (differences: 2, 3, 4, 5) satisfies this.  

5. **Clue 7 (Product Equality):**  
   - **Ratio Relationship:** B4/O4 = B5/O5. With B4=14, B5=15, O4=70, O5=75, the equation \(14 \times 75 = 15 \times 70 = 1050\) holds.  

6. **Clue 9 (Midpoint for N4):**  
   - **Midpoint Calculation:** N4 = (B4 + G4)/2 = (14 + 52)/2 = 33.  

7. **Clue 8 (Product Equality for I and G):**  
   - **Cross-Column Product:** \(I2 \times G2 = I3 \times G3\) → \(18 \times 57 = 19 \times 54 = 1026\).  

8. **Clue 10 (Multiples of 6):**  
   - **One Multiple per Column:** B=12, I=18, N=36, G=54, O=66.  

9. **Clue 6 (Sum Equality):**  
   - **Row 1 Sum = Row 5 Sum:** Both rows sum to 189.  

10. **Clue 11 (Single Square Number):**  
    - **Only 36 (6²):** Ensured no other squares (e.g., 64, 49) are present.

L (50) multiplied by 2 equal C (100).
Divide C by 20 and you have V. Divide V by 5 and you have I.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"SUMMARY:
1. **Identify the Letter-Number Mapping**: Recognize that each letter in the five-letter word corresponds to a Roman numeral value (e.g., C=100, I=1, V=5, L=50).
   
2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - **First Condition**: The fifth letter (L5) multiplied by 2 equals the first letter (L1):  
     \( L1 = 2 \times L5 \).
   - **Second Condition**: The first letter (L1) divided by 20 equals the third letter (L3):  
     \( L3 = \frac{L1}{20} \).
   - **Third Condition**: The third letter (L3) divided by 5 equals both the second (L2) and fourth (L4) letters:  
     \( L2 = L4 = \frac{L3}{5} \).

3. **Determine Valid Roman Numerals**:
   - For \( L5 \), select a Roman numeral that, when doubled, results in another valid numeral.  
     **Example**: \( L5 = 50 \) (L) → \( L1 = 100 \) (C).
   - Calculate \( L3 \):  
     \( L3 = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \) (V).
   - Calculate \( L2 \) and \( L4 \):  
     \( L2 = L4 = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \) (I).

4. **Verify Word Formation**:
   - Combine the letters: \( L1 = C \), \( L2 = I \), \( L3 = V \), \( L4 = I \), \( L5 = L \).

002 030 010 400",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Grid Constraints:**
   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 exactly once (Latin square).
   - Each number can be multiplied by \(10^0\), \(10^1\), or \(10^2\) (i.e., 1, 10, or 100), forming values like 1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200, etc.

2. **Analyze the Required Totals:**
   - High totals (e.g., 640, 550) necessitate large values (100s) in specific cells. For example:
     - Row 1 (640) requires contributions like 400 (4×100) + 200 (2×100) + 30 (3×10) + 10 (1×10).
     - Column D (550) requires values like 400 (4×100) + 100 (1×100) + 40 (4×10) + 10 (1×10).

3. **Assign Large Values First:**
   - Place 100s in cells to satisfy high totals while adhering to the Latin square. For example:
     - Row 1 uses 400 (4×100) and 200 (2×100).
     - Row 4 uses 400 (4×100) in Column D.

4. **Maintain the Latin Square Structure:**
   - Ensure no duplicate numbers in rows/columns. For instance:
     - If 4 is placed in Row 1 (as 400), it cannot reappear in the same row or column until allowed by the Latin square.

5. **Adjust Smaller Values to Match Totals:**
   - Use smaller scaled values (1s, 10s) to fill gaps. For example:
     - Row 3 (total 55) uses 4, 1, 30 (3×10), and 20 (2×10) to sum to 55.
     - Column A (total 316) combines 10 (1×10), 300 (3×100), 4 (4×1), and 2 (2×1).

6. **Verify All Totals and Constraints:**
   - Confirm that every row and column sums correctly and that numbers 1–4 appear exactly once in each row/column. For example:
     - Row 2: 300 (3×100) + 2 (2×1) + 40 (4×10) + 100 (1×100) = 442.
     - Column B: 400 (4×100) + 2 (2×1) + 1 (1×1) + 30 (3×10) = 433.

**Final Answer:**  
The grid is filled with appropriately scaled values (e.g., 010, 400) to meet all row/column totals and Latin square constraints. The minimal solution is achieved by strategically placing 100s, 10s, and 1s where required.",True
84,"Question: Mary Beem, who was a wife, mother of four and grandmother of nine, was shot to death by an angry relative. Find out the name of the relative it was by piecing together the relationships of each person with the clues below.
The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?
 Solution: From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.

     - **Robin** married to **Mo** (children: Bart, Buck, Bruce).  
     - **Maria** married to **Barry** (children: Bo, Molly).  
     - **Bill** married to **Myra** (children: Brad, Megan).  

2. **Analyze the Killer’s Sister’s Interactions:**  
   - The sister spoke to **Bob** (grandfather), **Bo** (cousin), and **Bill** (uncle).  
   - This means the sister is a grandchild (child of one of Mary’s children), and her parent must be a sibling of Bill.  

3. **Determine the Sister’s Parent:**  
   - Bill’s siblings are May, Robin, and Maria.  
   - The sister’s parent must be one of these.  
   - **Robin’s children are all male** (Bart, Buck, Bruce), so the sister cannot be Robin’s child.  
   - **Maria’s children are Bo (male) and Molly (female)**. If the sister were Molly, Bo would be her brother (not cousin), ruling this out.  
   - **May’s children are Missy (female) and Bernie (male)**. The sister must be **Missy**, making **Bernie** the killer.

Ninja B: Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group
Ninja C: Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group
Ninja D: Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group
Ninja E: Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group
Ninja F: Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group
Remember, the ninjas and pirates will lie about individual ninjas or pirates, not groups of ninjas or pirates.
 Solution: Ninja A is a pirate
Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja C is a ninja
Ninja D is a pirate
Ninja E is a pirate
Ninja F is a ninja
Ninja A said that Ninja B is a ninja. This is because Ninja A is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja A told the truth.
Ninja B said that Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja B is a ninja and Ninja C is a ninja, so Ninja B lied.
Ninja C said that Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group. Ninja C is obviously from the same group as Ninja C, so Ninja C lied.
Ninja D said that Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group. Ninja D is a pirate and Ninja A is a pirate so Ninja D lied.
Ninja E said that Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group. Ninja E is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja E told the truth.

1. **Determine the role of Ninja A:**
   - Assume Ninja A is a pirate. Pirates tell the truth about ninjas and lie about pirates.
   - Ninja A's statement: ""Ninja B is a ninja."" If true, B is a ninja. Since A is a pirate, this must be truthful, confirming B as a ninja.

2. **Analyze Ninja B's statement:**
   - B, a ninja, lies about ninjas and tells the truth about pirates.
   - B's statement: ""Ninja C belongs to A's group (pirates)."" Since C is actually a ninja, B's claim is false, satisfying the ninja's rule to lie about fellow ninjas.

3. **Evaluate Ninja C's claim:**
   - C, a ninja, states, ""C doesn't belong to F's group."" 
   - If F were a pirate, C (ninja) would truthfully deny being in F's group. However, F is later deduced to be a ninja, making C's statement false. This aligns with ninjas lying about their own group.

4. **Assess Ninja D's assertion:**
   - D claims, ""A belongs to B's group."" A (pirate) and B (ninja) are in different groups. 
   - D, a pirate, lies about pirates, falsely asserting A is in B's group, consistent with pirate behavior.

5. **Examine Ninja E's declaration:**
   - E, a pirate, says, ""B belongs to C's group."" Both B and C are ninjas, making this statement true. Pirates tell the truth about ninjas, validating E's role as a pirate.

6. **Verify Ninja F's statement:**
   - F, a ninja, claims, ""E belongs to A's group."" E and A are pirates, so the statement is true. Ninjas truthfully report about pirates, confirming F's role as a ninja.

**Final Identifications:**
- **Pirates:** Ninja A, D, E (lie about pirates, tell truth about ninjas).
- **Ninjas:** Ninja B, C, F (lie about ninjas, tell truth about pirates).

The six letter code word, <([])>, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Solution: Casual and Formal",Attire,Casual and Formal,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Symbol Mappings:** Each symbol in the code `<([])>` corresponds to specific letters:
   - `<`: F, E, C, R, P
   - `(`: N, A, H, O, B
   - `[`: F, S, E, D, R
   - `]`: W, M, J, U, Y
   - `)`: T, E, S, A, L
   - `>`: E, R, L, K, S

2. **Determine Word Structure:** The six-symbol code must split into two three-letter words that are opposites. Common three-letter opposites include ""NEW/OLD,"" ""WET/DRY,"" or ""HOT/COLD,"" but these are checked against the symbol mappings.

3. **Test Possible Words:** Evaluate combinations of letters for each symbol to form valid three-letter words. For example:
   - **First Three Symbols (`<`, `(`, `[`):** Possible letters for positions 1-3 include F, C, R (e.g., ""FAR,"" ""CAR"").
   - **Last Three Symbols (`]`, `)`, `>`):** Possible letters for positions 4-6 include W, M, Y, E, S (e.g., ""YES,"" ""RYE"").

4. **Find Opposites:** Check if the derived words are antonyms. For instance:
   - If the first three symbols map to ""FAR,"" the opposite ""NEAR"" is invalid due to length.
   - If the second three symbols map to ""YES,"" the opposite ""NO"" is too short.

5. **Leverage Example Solution Clues:** The provided answer (""Casual"" and ""Formal"") suggests mapping symbols to form these words despite apparent contradictions. This involves:
   - Mapping `<` to F (for ""Formal"") or C (for ""Casual"").
   - Assigning other symbols to letters like O, R, M, A, L (for ""Formal"") or A, S, U, A, L (for ""Casual"").

6. **Final Mapping:** Despite constraints, the symbols are assigned letters to form ""FORMAL"" and ""CASUAL"" by allowing each symbol to represent different letters in each word (though this stretches the problem's rules).

**ANSWER:**  
The two opposite words are **FORMAL** and **CASUAL**.  
**Key Letters:**  
- `<` → F (Formal) or C (Casual)  
- `(` → O (Formal) or A (Casual)  
- `[` → R (Formal) or S (Casual)  
- `]` → M (Formal) or U (Casual)  
- `)` → A (both words)  
- `>` → L (both words).",True
89,"Question: Mad Ade was looking after his two year old Nephew (He charges two Kebabs an hour if you are in need of a babysitter).
His Nephew had 4 play blocks each with 6 sides. Each side has a letter from the alphabet. No letters are ever repeated. By arranging the blocks in different ways Mad Ade's nephew managed (By complete and utter fluke) to spell all the words listed below:
BODY
MAZE
CURT
MOVE
DRAW
NOTE
FEAR
PICK
HUNT
QUIT
JOKE
SNOB
KNEW
TYPE
LIFE
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on the Kebabs he was earning.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Solution: Out of the 26 letters in the alphabet, Only G and X are not used.
There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE. It means that none of the letters in these 7 words can be on the same block as the letter 'E'. Hence, the other 5 letters must be from B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.
As BODY is one of the possible word, B and D can not be on the same block.Similarly, C and U also can not be on the same block as CURT is one of the possible word. Hence, E, H, Q, S are on the same block.
Also, S and B can not be on the same block (SNOB). Q and U can not be on the same block (QUIT). Hence, first Block contains C, D, E, H, Q, S
the easiest way is to write down 4 rows each with A to Z, except G and X. Take each word one by one, remove not possible letters and circle the possible letters.
The letters on four blocks are:
Block 1 : C, D, E, H, Q, S
Block 2 : A, B, K, L, T, V
Block 3 : F, O, P, U, W, Z
Block 4 : I, J, M, N, R, Y","There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE.

Block 4 : I, J, M, N, R, Y",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify High-Frequency Letters:**  
   The letter 'E' appears in 7 words (MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE). This means all other letters in these words cannot share a block with 'E'. These excluded letters are M, A, Z, O, V, N, T, F, R, J, K, W, Y, P, L, I.

2. **Determine Possible Letters for E's Block:**  
   Letters not excluded for E’s block are B, C, D, H, Q, S, U (7 letters). Since each block holds 6 letters, one must be omitted. Constraints from other words (e.g., C and U in CURT, Q and U in QUIT) force E’s block to exclude U. Thus, Block 1: **C, D, E, H, Q, S**.

3. **Assign Letters with Conflicts:**  
   - **B** and **D** (BODY) cannot coexist, so B is placed on Block 2.  
   - **C** (Block 1) and **U** (CURT) must be separate, so U goes to Block 3.  
   - **Q** (Block 1) and **U** (QUIT) are separated, confirming U on Block 3.  
   - **S** (Block 1) and **B** (SNOB) are split, placing B on Block 2.  

4. **Distribute Remaining Letters Logically:**  
   - **Block 2**: Includes A (MAZE), B, K (KNEW), L (LIFE), T (TYPE), V (MOVE).  
   - **Block 3**: Contains F (FEAR), O (BODY, MOVE, NOTE), P (PICK), U (CURT, QUIT), W (DRAW), Z (MAZE).  
   - **Block 4**: Houses I (QUIT, LIFE), J (JOKE), M (MAZE), N (SNOB), R (DRAW), Y (BODY, TYPE).  

5. **Verify All Words Fit:**  
   Each word’s letters are spread across distinct blocks, adhering to the rule that no word uses two letters from the same block.  

**Final Arrangement:**  
- **Block 1**: C, D, E, H, Q, S  
- **Block 2**: A, B, K, L, T, V  
- **Block 3**: F, O, P, U, W, Z  
- **Block 4**: I, J, M, N, R, Y",True

Reverse the order of the numbers given, then from beginning to end, that is the number of the letter in each word; once you have all 6 letters reverse them and that forms the password.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Reverse the number sequence**: The given number is 341223. Reversing it yields 322143.  
   *Reasoning*: The problem states reversing the order of the numbers to start the decoding process.

2. **Map each digit to a word in the phrase**: The phrase ""wish about happiness but never ask"" has six words. Each digit in 322143 corresponds to one word in order:  
   - 3 → 1st word (""wish"")  
   - 2 → 2nd word (""about"")  
   - 2 → 3rd word (""happiness"")  
   - 1 → 4th word (""but"")  
   - 4 → 5th word (""never"")  
   - 3 → 6th word (""ask"").  
   *Reasoning*: Each digit represents the position of a letter within its respective word.

3. **Extract letters using the numbers**:  
   - 3rd letter of ""wish"" → **s**  
   - 2nd letter of ""about"" → **b**  
   - 2nd letter of ""happiness"" → **a**  
   - 1st letter of ""but"" → **b**  
   - 4th letter of ""never"" → **e**  
   - 3rd letter of ""ask"" → **k**.  
   *Resulting sequence*: **s, b, a, b, e, k**.

4. **Reverse the extracted letters**: Reversing **s, b, a, b, e, k** gives **k, e, b, a, b, s**.  
   *Reasoning*: The final step to form the password is reversing the order of the extracted letters.

1. **Fix Known Digits:**
   - Position 3 is 0 (given).

2. **Analyze 5th and 10th Digits:**
   - Their sum is a square (1, 4, 16) but not 9. Only valid possibility is 16 (7 + 9 or 9 + 7). Since 10th digit must pair with 9th to form a cube (1 or 8), 10th digit = 7 (as 9 + 7 = 16 and 1 + 7 = 8, a cube). Thus:
     - 5th digit = 9, 10th digit = 7.
     - 9th digit = 1 (since 1 + 7 = 8).

3. **Place 8 and 9:**
   - 8 and 9 must be two positions apart. With 9 in position 5, 8 is placed in position 7 (two positions away).

4. **Locate Digit 3:**
   - 3 must be adjacent to 9 (position 5) but not next to 0. The only valid spot is position 6.

5. **Assign 4th, 6th, and 8th Digits:**
   - Sum must be ≤9. With 6th digit = 3, remaining digits for 4th and 8th are 2 and 4 (sum = 6). Position 4 ≠ 4, so:
     - 4th digit = 2, 8th digit = 4.

1. **Identify Goats (Clue 7 & 3):**  
   - Goats must be in two of B, C, K, O. B and L are the same (Clue 3), so they cannot be goats (they would use both goats, conflicting with Clue 7). Thus, goats are in **K and O**.

2. **Place Horse (Clue 2):**  
   - Since O is a goat, E must be a **horse** (E ≠ O, and one has a horse).

3. **Assign Lions (Clue 8):**  
   - Lions are in two of A, E, F, M. E is a horse, so lions are in **A and F**.

4. **Determine Dog (Clue 1):**  
   - A (lion) and D must differ; one is a dog. Thus, **D = dog**.

5. **Resolve C and M (Clue 4):**  
   - C and M are the same, not beavers. They cannot be lions (A/F), goats (K/O), dogs (D), or horses (E). They are **walruses**.

6. **Assign Beavers (Clue 11):**  
   - Beavers and walruses must connect. Walruses (C, M) connect to **G and J (beavers)**.

7. **Place Cats (Clue 3 & 9):**  
   - B and L are the same, not tigers. They cannot be adjacent to dogs (D or I). **B and L = cats**.

8. **Locate Tigers (Clues 5, 6, 10):**  
   - Tigers must be in different columns and adjacent to goats (K/O). **H and N** fit, satisfying all constraints.

4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.
10. The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15.
 Solution: 6:45, Damien Ivens, Oakland, Beekeeper
7:00, Alice Lautremont, Palo Alto, Antique car collector
7:15, Cathy Morley, Berkeley, Hypnotherapist
7:30, Brandon Jaspersen, Corte Madera, Bungee jumper
7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.
Since Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto. Likewise, Kreiger, who must be from Daly City, cannot be Francine, and must be named Evan. This leaves Francine at 8:00.","Females are Alice, Cathy and Francine; males are Brandon, Damien and Evan.","6:45, Damien Ivens, Oakland, Beekeeper

97,"Question: Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.
 Solution: Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.

1. **Identify Key Clues and Constraints:**
   - Two fishermen won no categories.
   - First place was a tie between two with equal points.
   - Each clue provides constraints on names, lures, and categories.

2. **Assign Last Names and Lures:**
   - From clue 5, the spinner bait user won the largest fish (not Mr. Smith). 
   - From clue 6, Mr. Jones won ""most fish"" (3 points) and didn’t use deep crank.
   - Clue 1 links Mike, Mr. Black, and the plastic worm user. Since Terry cannot be Mr. Black, Kevin becomes Mr. Black (spinner bait user).

3. **Resolve Categories and Points:**
   - Kevin Black (spinner bait) wins largest and second-largest fish (2+1 points) + bonus = 4 points.
   - Mike Smith (deep-running crank) wins total weight (4 points), tying with Kevin.
   - Vick Jones (plastic worm) wins most fish (3 points).
   - Sam McNess (weighted jig) and Terry Larson (wounded minnow) win no categories.

4. **Verify All Clues:**
   - Ensure no contradictions in last names, lures, or categories.
   - Confirm boat trouble, proximity, and non-winning status for Sam and Terry.

**FINAL MAPPING:**
- **Kevin Black**: Spinner bait. Won largest fish (2), second-largest (1), bonus (1) → **4 points**.
- **Mike Smith**: Deep-running crank. Won total weight → **4 points**.
- **Vick Jones**: Plastic worm. Won most fish → **3 points**.
- **Sam McNess**: Weighted jig. No categories → **0 points**.
- **Terry Larson**: Wounded minnow. No categories → **0 points**.

From the statements below identify each of the 5 Handy people's height (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hands) and their ages (100, 110, 120, 130 and 140 years).
TWIST: One statement is FALSE.
1. Har was not the oldest, nor was he the shortest or tallest.
2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.
 Solution: Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years
Tolo, 12 hands, 120 years
Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.

3. **Assign Ages:**  
   - Statement 4: Oldest (140 years) is **Frer (13 hands)**.  
   - Statement 3: Tolo is older than Har and not second oldest → Tolo = **120 years**, Har = **110 years** (fourth oldest).  
   - Statement 6: Edvo > Winn in age → Edvo = **130 years**, Winn = **100 years**.

101,"Question: You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.
How many survivors can you guarantee, assuming the tribe leader is not lying and that each person will follow your instructions? For example, if you tell everybody to guess, you can guarantee zero survivors because you have a slight chance of getting zero survivors.
 Solution: You can guarantee that 1/2 of the people will survive.

1. **Pairing Strategy:**  
   Divide the 500 participants into 250 pairs. Each pair consists of two people, Person A and Person B.

2. **Guessing Rules:**  
   - **Person A** is instructed to guess their own headband color as the **same** color as Person B’s visible headband.  
   - **Person B** is instructed to guess their own headband color as the **opposite** color of Person A’s visible headband.  

3. **Outcome Analysis:**  
   For every possible combination of headband colors in a pair:  
   - If both have the **same color**, Person A guesses correctly, and Person B guesses incorrectly.  
   - If they have **different colors**, Person B guesses correctly, and Person A guesses incorrectly.  
   **Result:** Exactly one person in each pair survives, regardless of the actual headband colors.  

4. **Guaranteed Survivors:**  
   Since there are 250 pairs and each pair guarantees 1 survivor, the minimum number of survivors is **250**.  

**Answer:**  
You can guarantee that **250 survivors** will always correctly guess their headband color.",True
102,"Question: Captain John has escaped his home town onto his ship, the ""Wasp"", and now Captain John sits in his cabin reading his map. Standing up, he walks out the door into the middle of the deck and announces ""we have made it this far, but next we need to find both shipwrecks in the right order to point us the right way, towards the island"", followed by tons of ""ehs"".
There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.
With what Captain John knows about the sea, can you figure out where the nine things in a 3-by-3 grid(Wasp, sunken ship 1, sunken ship 2, 2 oceans, 3 reefs, and the island) and go in the right path to the first sunken ship, the second, then the island, without passing over a reef.
The ship can move 1 space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and it can only pass each space once.
1. The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships.
2. There are at least two reefs to the right of sunken ship 2, but the ship isn't in the same row as either of the reefs.
3. One of the oceans is diagonal to only two reefs.
4. The columns and rows of the Wasp and island together take up every single space except the 2nd row of the 3rd column.
5. The island is between two reefs.
6. One of the reefs is somewhere above the other two reefs.
 Solution: The 9 things in the grid go as followed.

1. **Determine Wasp and Island Positions (Clue 4):**
   - The Wasp and Island’s rows/columns must cover all cells except (2,3). Thus:
     - Wasp at (1,1) and Island at (3,2).
     - This ensures rows 1 & 3 and columns 1 & 2 are covered, leaving (2,3) excluded.

2. **Place Sunken Ships (Clue 1):**
   - Wasp is in row 1, so both sunken ships must be in row 1 or column 1.
   - Assign:
     - Sunken Ship 1 (SS1) at (1,3) (same row as Wasp).
     - Sunken Ship 2 (SS2) at (1,2) (same row as Wasp).

3. **Position Reefs (Clues 2, 5, 6):**
   - **Clue 2:** At least two reefs to the right of SS2 (1,2). These are in column 3: (2,3) and (3,3).
   - **Clue 5:** Island (3,2) is between two reefs horizontally: place reefs at (3,1) and (3,3).
   - **Clue 6:** One reef above others: reef at (2,3) (row 2) is above reefs at (3,1) and (3,3).

4. **Assign Oceans (Clue 3):**
   - Remaining cells: (2,1) and (2,2).
   - **Clue 3:** The ocean at (2,2) is diagonal to two reefs (3,1 and 3,3). Both oceans are placed at (2,1) and (2,2).

5. **Verify Path Validity:**
   - Path: Wasp (1,1) → Ocean (2,2) → SS1 (1,3) → SS2 (1,2) → Ocean (2,1) → Island (3,2).
   - Movement: All steps are 1 space (diagonal/vertical/horizontal), no reefs crossed, no repeats.

**FINAL GRID:**

| Wasp (1) | SS2 (4) | SS1 (3) |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Ocean (5)| Ocean (2)| Reef (X)|
| Reef (X) | Island (6) | Reef (X) |

**Key Steps Confirming Clues:**
- **Clue 1:** Wasp shares row 1 with both ships.
- **Clue 2:** Two reefs (2,3 and 3,3) are right of SS2 (1,2); Wasp’s row (1) has no reefs.
- **Clue 3:** Ocean (2,2) diagonally adjacent to two reefs (3,1 and 3,3).
- **Clue 4:** Excluded cell (2,3) is a reef, adhering to row/column coverage.
- **Clue 5/6:** Island (3,2) between reefs; reef (2,3) is above others.

**Answer:** The grid is arranged as above, with the path sequence traversing Wasp → SS1 → SS2 → Island, avoiding reefs. The minimal configuration satisfies all constraints.",True
103,"Question: You are blindfolded before a table. On the table are a very large number of pennies. You are told 128 of the pennies are heads up and the rest are tails up. How can you create two subgroups of pennies, each with the same number of heads facing up, while remaining blindfolded?
 Solution: Create a subgroup of any 128 pennies. Then flip over all 128. That group of 128 and the group of all the remaining pennies will have the same number of heads facing up.
This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",You can flip some subgroup of the pennies!,"Create a subgroup of any 128 pennies.

1. **Form a subgroup of 128 pennies:**  
   Blindfolded, separate any 128 pennies from the total. Let the number of heads in this subgroup be \( H \). The remaining pennies then have \( 128 - H \) heads (since the total heads are 128).

2. **Flip all pennies in the subgroup:**  
   Flipping converts \( H \) heads to tails and \( 128 - H \) tails to heads in the subgroup. The subgroup now contains \( 128 - H \) heads.

3. **Equate the heads in both groups:**  
   The remaining pennies already had \( 128 - H \) heads. After flipping, both subgroups (the flipped 128 and the rest) now have \( 128 - H \) heads, satisfying the requirement.  

**Key Insight:**  
The tails in the subgroup (\( 128 - H \)) directly correspond to the heads left in the remaining pile. Flipping the subgroup swaps tails and heads in the subgroup, equalizing the counts.",True
104,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?
 Solution: Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

1. **Manny's Statement (A is odd):**  
   Manny knows his number (A) is odd because if A were even, B and C could be equal. Thus, possible A: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.

2. **Moe's Deduction (B must ensure all distinct after Manny's clue):**  
   Moe, knowing B and hearing that B ≠ C, concludes all numbers are distinct. This eliminates B = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Valid B: 2, 6, 10.  
   - For B = 2, 6, 10: All triples (A, B, C) must have distinct values after A is confirmed as odd and C ≠ B.

3. **Jack's Final Deduction (Unique C identifies the triple):**  
   Jack knows C and the prior deductions. Only C = 9 or 11 uniquely identifies a single triple.  
   - If C = 11: Triple is (1, 2, 11), but Jack would know this immediately after Manny's statement, contradicting the flow.  
   - If C = 9: Triple is (3, 2, 9), which Jack deduces only after Moe's statement.

2. **Apply Clue 1 (Peter’s Love):**  
   Peter (M1) loves a girl (G1), who loves Albert (M2). This sets the start of the cycle:  
   **Peter → G1 → Albert → G2 → …**

3. **Apply Clue 2 (Joseph’s Love):**  
   Joseph loves a girl (Gx) who loves a man (My) who loves Elaine. Elaine must be two steps after Joseph. Two scenarios are tested:  
   - **Case A:** Joseph is placed later in the cycle (e.g., M3 → G3 → M4 → Elaine).  
   - **Case B:** Elaine is placed earlier (e.g., Peter → Elaine → Albert → …).  

4. **Incorporate Paolo and Clue 3 (Liza’s Connection):**  
   - **Case A:** Paolo (M4) loves Elaine (G4). Liza is loved by Peter (M1), who is loved by Elaine (G4), who is loved by Paolo. This fits: **Paolo → Elaine → Peter → Liza.**  
   - **Case B:** Conflicts arise when trying to satisfy Liza’s connection.  

5. **Apply Clue 4 (Linda’s Hate):**  
   - **Case A:** Linda (G2) is hated by the man Amy loves (Paolo). Since Paolo loves Elaine, not Linda, this works.  
   - **Case B:** Paolo loves Linda, violating the clue.  

6. **Finalize Valid Cycle (Case A):**  
   The valid cycle is:

   - Possible pairs: (C=3, F=6) or (C=2, F=4), but only **C=3, F=6** works (CE=30).

4. **Solve Equation 4 (G * I = CF):**
   - CF = 36 (C=3, F=6), so G and I multiply to 36.
   - Valid pairs: **G=9, I=4** (since 9*4=36).

5. **Solve Equation 3 (D * G = BH):**
   - G=9, so D * 9 must be a two-digit number (BH).
   - **D=8** (8*9=72 → B=7, H=2).

6. **Solve Equation 2 (B * H = JI):**
   - B=7, H=2 → 7*2=14 → JI=14 (J=1, I=4). Valid.

7. **Assign Remaining Digits:**
   - Only remaining digit for D is 8.
   - Verify all digits (5,7,3,8,0,6,9,2,4,1) are unique and fit all equations.

**Final Number:**  
**A=5, B=7, C=3, D=8, E=0, F=6, G=9, H=2, I=4, J=1** → **5738069241**.",True
108,"Question: In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?
 Solution: He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.  So in reality he left them all the same thing.",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.  So in reality he left them all the same thing.,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Stu Pidfule left different amounts of money to his three children but treated them equally. The challenge is to reconcile unequal monetary amounts with equal treatment.

2. **Identifying Equality Beyond Absolute Amounts:** The key is recognizing equality in a non-monetary measure. Since Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy have different financial habits (investing, spending, squandering), their inheritances must reflect a common metric tied to their individual circumstances.

3. **Linking Inheritance to Personal Salary:** Stu left each child an inheritance equal to **one year of their own annual salary**. This means:
   - Derek, who invests wisely (likely a higher salary), receives a larger sum.
   - Eric, who spends wildly (potentially a moderate salary), receives a moderate sum.
   - Monkeyboy, who buys magic beans (unknown salary but distinct from the others), receives a sum based on his salary.

4. **Establishing Fairness Through Proportionality:** While the absolute amounts differ, each child receives the equivalent of **one year’s effort in their own financial context**. This ensures fairness by valuing their time equally, even if their earnings (and thus inheritances) vary. 

5. **Conclusion:** Stu treated his children equally by providing each with a proportional measure (one year’s salary) rather than identical monetary amounts. The disparity in inheritance reflects their individual earning capacities, not unequal treatment.",True

Each of the five council members cast an aye or a nay vote for each of the five proposals, with no abstentions. Use the clues below to discover how each council member voted on each of the proposals.
1. Each proposal got a different number of aye votes (possibly zero).
2. All in all, there was one more aye vote than nay vote cast.
3. At no time did Quincy vote nay on two consecutive proposals.
4. Orlando, Penny and Sven voted the same way on the second proposal.
5. Rosina voted aye on the fourth proposal.
6. Quincy and Sven voted differently from each other on each of the first three proposals.
7. The third proposal received one more aye vote than the second proposal did.
 Solution: Orlando - nay, aye, aye, aye, nay

Quincy - aye, nay, aye, aye, nay
Rosina - nay, nay, aye, aye, nay
Sven - nay, aye, nay, aye, nay",Write down all your steps and be sure to check that each logical deduction follows with 100% certainty from the information you have,"Orlando - nay, aye, aye, aye, nay
Penny - nay, aye, aye, aye, nay
Quincy - aye, nay, aye, aye, nay
Rosina - nay, nay, aye, aye, nay
Sven - nay, aye, nay, aye, nay",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Total Votes and Ayes/Nays:**
   - Each proposal has 5 votes (5 council members).
   - Total votes: \(5 \times 5 = 25\).
   - Clue 2: Total ayes = nays + 1 → \(13\) ayes and \(12\) nays.

2. **Determine Aye Counts per Proposal:**
   - Clue 1: Distinct aye counts (0–5). The only valid combination summing to 13 is \(0, 1, 3, 4, 5\).
   - Clue 7: Proposal 3 has one more aye than Proposal 2 → Proposals 2 and 3 must be \(3\) and \(4\) ayes, respectively.

3. **Assign Aye Counts to Proposals:**
   - Proposal 2: \(3\) ayes.
   - Proposal 3: \(4\) ayes.
   - Remaining counts \(0, 1, 5\) assigned to Proposals 1, 4, 5. Since Proposal 4 must have at least 1 aye (Clue 5):
     - Proposal 4: \(5\) ayes (all members vote aye).
     - Proposal 1: \(1\) aye.
     - Proposal 5: \(0\) ayes (all nay).

4. **Deduce Votes Using Clues:**
   - **Clue 4:** Orlando (O), Penny (P), Sven (S) vote identically on Proposal 2 (all aye → 3 ayes total). The 4th aye must be from Rosina (R) or Quincy (Q). 
   - **Clue 6:** Q and Sven vote oppositely on Proposals 1–3. Since Sven votes aye on Proposal 2, Q votes nay.
   - **Proposal 1:** Only 1 aye (Q votes aye; others nay to satisfy distinct counts).
   - **Proposal 3:** 4 ayes. Q and Sven must differ → Q votes aye, Sven nay.
   - **Proposal 4:** All aye (including Rosina per Clue 5).
   - **Proposal 5:** All nay.

5. **Verify Consistency:**
   - **Clue 3:** Quincy’s votes: aye (P1), nay (P2), aye (P3), aye (P4), nay (P5). No consecutive nays.
   - **Clue 6:** Q and Sven differ on P1 (aye/nay), P2 (nay/aye), P3 (aye/nay).

111,"Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?
 Solution: The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't."," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive.

9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Analyze the Flower's Incentives:**
   - The flower's primary goal is survival; it will only produce poison if it prevents being eaten.
   - Producing poison is costly (undesirable) and ineffective unless it deters the dog. However, the dog cannot observe whether poison exists, so the flower’s decision cannot influence the dog’s choice retroactively.

2. **Dog’s Decision-Making:**
   - If the dog eats the flower:
     - **Without poison:** Dog survives (100% chance).
     - **With poison:** Dog dies (0% chance).
   - If the dog doesn’t eat the flower:
     - Dog faces a 50% survival chance from the virus.
   - The dog must compare these outcomes based on its knowledge of the flower’s rationality.

3. **Flower’s Rational Choice:**
   - Since the dog cannot observe poison, the flower’s choice cannot alter the dog’s action. Whether the dog eats or not, producing poison does not improve the flower’s survival odds (it dies if eaten regardless). Thus, the flower optimally chooses **not to produce poison** to avoid unnecessary effort.

4. **Dog’s Conclusion:**
   - The dog knows the flower is rational and will not waste effort on poison. Therefore, the dog infers the flower is **not poisonous**.
   - Eating the flower guarantees survival (100% chance), while not eating offers only a 50% chance. The dog rationally chooses to **eat the flower**.

5. **Outcome:**
   - The flower does not produce poison, and the dog eats it, surviving with certainty. This outcome is the only Nash equilibrium, as both parties act optimally given their knowledge of each other’s rationality.

**ANSWER:**  
The dog will eat the flower. Since the flower cannot deter the dog by producing poison (as the dog cannot observe it), the flower rationally avoids making poison. The dog, knowing this, eats the flower to guarantee survival instead of risking a 50% chance of death.",True
112,"Question: In a survey to find the greatest human being, the top four people and their occupation were listed in Clock magazine. However, only one entry in each field was correctly positioned. The following facts were true. (1) Albert was two places above the bricklayer, (2) Darling was one place below Charles, (3) Curious was two places below the welder. Can you find the 1st name, surname and occupation for each position?
First Name
1st place - Isaac
2nd place - Albert

4th place - Darling
Occupation
1st place - Welder
2nd place - Gardener
3rd place - Cleaner
4th place - Bricklayer
 Solution: Using (1), Albert is at 1 or 2. If he is at 1, then from (3), Charles is at 2 or 3. However, with Charles at 2 (and Darling at 3), from (2), Curious can only be at 4 and so it is not possible to find just one correct entry in the Surname list (Newtune and Eyeline must be both correct or both incorrect). If Charles is at 3 (with Darling at 4), then from (2), Curious can only be at 3. This gives both Curious and Darling correct (invalid). So Albert must be at 2 (with the bricklayer at 4). From (3), Charles can be at 1 or 3. However, if Charles is at 3 (with Darling at 4), then both Curious and Darling are correct (invalid). So Charles is at 1 (with Darling at 2).

1. **Clue (1): Albert is two places above the bricklayer.**
   - Possible pairs: Albert at 1 & Bricklayer at 3, or Albert at 2 & Bricklayer at 4.
   - Assume Albert is at 2 (correct position). Then Bricklayer is at 4 (correct occupation). This aligns with the original lists, meaning First Name (Albert) and Occupation (Bricklayer) each have one correct entry.

2. **Clue (2): Darling is one place below Charles.**
   - If Charles is in position \( x \), Darling must be at \( x+1 \).
   - Charles cannot be at 4 (original position) since First Name has only Albert correct. Testing positions:
     - If Charles is at 1, Darling is at 2 (Surname). Original Surname at 2 is Eyeline, so Darling at 2 would be incorrect, making it the valid correct entry in Surnames.

3. **Clue (3): Curious is two places below the welder.**
   - Welder’s position \( w \) implies Curious is at \( w+2 \).
   - Original Welder at 1 is incorrect. Assign Welder to position 3 (originally Cleaner), making Curious at 5 (invalid). Contradiction.
   - Correct Welder position must be 1 (original), but since only Bricklayer is correct in Occupation, Welder is actually at 1 (incorrectly listed). Adjust to resolve contradictions.

4. **Resolving Conflicts:**
   - First Name: Albert at 2 (correct).
   - Surname: Darling at 2 (incorrect original; correct entry is Darling moved to 2).
   - Occupation: Bricklayer at 4 (correct). Welder must be at 1 (incorrect original), satisfying clue (3) by placing Curious at 3 (two below Welder at 1).

**Final Answer:**
- **1st Place:** Charles Newtune Welder  
- **2nd Place:** Albert Darling Gardener  
- **3rd Place:** Marie Curious Bricklayer  
- **4th Place:** Isaac Eyeline Cleaner  

**Validation:**
- **First Name:** Only Albert at 2 is correct.
- **Surname:** Only Darling at 2 is correct (moved from original 4).
- **Occupation:** Only Bricklayer at 4 is correct.
- **Clues Satisfied:**
  1. Albert (2) is two above Bricklayer (4).
  2. Darling (2) is one below Charles (1).

113,"Question: Little Mad Ade, son of Mad Ade, leaves home in the morning to go to school. As he leaves the house he looks at the clock in the mirror. The clock has no number indication and for this reason the boy makes a mistake in interpreting the time (mirror-image). Just assuming the clock must be out of order, the Little Mad Ade cycles to school, where he arrives after twenty minutes. At that moment, the clock at school shows a time that is two and a half hours later than the time that Little Mad Ade saw on the clock at home.
At what time did he reach school?
 Solution: The difference between the real time and the time of the mirror image is two hours and ten minutes (two and a half hours, minus the twenty minutes of cycling). Therefore, the original time on the clock at home that morning could only have been five minutes past seven:
The difference between these clocks is exactly 2 hours and ten minutes (note that also five minutes past one can be mirrored in a similar way, but this is not in the morning!).

Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the actual time when Little Mad Ade leaves home.
   - The mirror time he sees is \( M = 12:00 - T \).

2. **Establish Relationships:**
   - School arrival time is \( T + 20 \) minutes.
   - According to the problem, school arrival time = \( M + 2.5 \) hours.

3. **Set Up Equation:**
   - Substitute \( M \) into the arrival time equation:
     \[
     T + 20 = (12:00 - T) + 2:30
     \]

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Convert times to minutes for calculation:
     \[
     T + 20 = (720 - T) + 150 \implies 2T = 850 \implies T = 425 \text{ minutes (7:05 AM)}.
     \]

5. **Calculate Arrival Time:**
   - Add 20 minutes to departure time:
     \[
     7:05 \text{ AM} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 7:25 \text{ AM}.
     \]

6. **Verify Consistency:**
   - Mirror time at departure: \( 12:00 - 7:05 = 4:55 \).
   - School time: \( 4:55 + 2:30 = 7:25 \), confirming consistency.

**Final Answer:**  
Little Mad Ade reached school at **twenty-five minutes past seven (7:25 AM)**.",True
114,"Question: You have four alphabet blocks.  Each block has a different letter of the alphabet on each of its six sides.  Using these four blocks, you can spell any of the following words.  Can you figure out what six letters appear on each of the four blocks?
BODY
CRUX
JACK
JOHN
KNOW
LIFT
MANX
PUGS
QUAD
SHIM
WRIT
YELP
 Solution: The first thing that you should notice is that all of the letters except V and Z appear.  Therefore each letter appears only on one block.  The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).  But block 4 must also have a letter from YELP, which can only be P, and a letter from BODY, which can only be D.  G is on block 3 (PUGS), as is Q(QUAD).  Block 3, which already has C, G, I, N, and Q, can only have one more letter:  this sixth letter must be in both BODY and YELP, so it must be Y.  B is on block 1 (BODY).  Block 1, then, contains B, J, M, U, and W, and can have only one more letter:  this sixth letter must be in both LIFT and YELP, so it must be L.  Finally, block 2 holds E (YELP) and F (LIFT).

115,"Question: One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?
 Solution: The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The Stooges set a pattern where each person taps others with the **same number of vowels in their name**, **once per vowel** in the tapper's name.  
   - Example: Moe (2 vowels: O, E) taps others with 2 vowels (James, Gandhi, Pope, Saul) twice each (2 taps per person).

2. **Analyze Vowel Counts:**
   - **Kings:** James (2), Saul (2), Henry (1).  
   - **Queens:** Victoria (4), Elizabeth (4), Candace (3).  
   - **Religious Figures:** Pope (2), Mother Teresa (5), Gandhi (2).  
   - **Stooges:** Moe (2), Larry (1), Curly (1).  

3. **Apply the Pattern to All Actions:**
   - **Moe (2 vowels):** Taps 2-vowel individuals (James, Gandhi, Pope, Saul) twice each.  
   - **Larry (1 vowel):** Taps 1-vowel individuals (Henry, Curly) once each.  
   - **Curly (1 vowel):** Taps 1-vowel individuals (Henry, Larry) once each.  
   - **Kings follow suit:** James/Saul (2 vowels) tap 2-vowel people twice; Henry (1 vowel) taps 1-vowel people once.  
   - **Queens follow:** Victoria/Elizabeth (4 vowels) tap each other four times.  

4. **Identify Untouched Individuals:**
   - **Candace (3 vowels):** No tapper has 3 vowels to match her count.  
   - **Mother Teresa (5 vowels):** No tapper has 5 vowels, and religious figures don’t tap others.  

**Untouchables:** Candace (3 vowels) and Mother Teresa (5 vowels) remain untapped, as no one shares their vowel counts to trigger taps.",True

How many points did each player score?
 Solution: 1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.

There are 6 zeros, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Problem Structure:**
   - We need a 10-digit number where each digit \( D_i \) (0 ≤ i ≤ 9) represents the count of digit \( i \) in the entire number.
   - The sum of all digits \( D_0 + D_1 + \dots + D_9 = 10 \).

2. **Determine Constraints:**
   - \( D_0 \) (the first digit) cannot be 0.
   - Each \( D_i \) must equal the number of times digit \( i \) appears in the number.

3. **Assume \( D_0 = 6 \) (Number of Zeros):**
   - If \( D_0 = 6 \), there are six zeros. The remaining four non-zero digits must sum to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \).

4. **Assign Values to Non-Zero Digits:**
   - Let \( D_1 = 2 \) (two '1's), \( D_2 = 1 \) (one '2'), and \( D_6 = 1 \) (one '6'). These sum to \( 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \).
   - Verify consistency:
     - **Zeros:** Positions 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 are zeros (total 6).
     - **Ones:** Positions 2 (\( D_2 = 1 \)) and 6 (\( D_6 = 1 \)) are '1's (total 2).
     - **Two:** Position 1 (\( D_1 = 2 \)) is a '2' (total 1).
     - **Six:** Position 0 (\( D_0 = 6 \)) is a '6' (total 1).

5. **Final Number:**
   - The digits are \( 6, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 \), forming the number **6210001000**.

119,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?
 Solution: Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.  There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.  Namely, for (Snap, Crackle, Pop) they are:
(1, 7, 6)
(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.
And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",,"Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.

And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Snap's Statement (S is Odd):**  
   - The sum S + C + P = 14.  
   - Snap knows his number S and deduces C ≠ P.  
   - For C and P to always differ, 14 − S must be odd (since an odd sum requires one even and one odd number).  
   - Thus, **S must be odd**. Possible S: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.  

2. **Crackle's Statement (C ≥ 7):**  
   - Crackle knows C and hears Snap’s statement.  
   - To ensure all three numbers are distinct, C must be ≥ 7.  
     - If C ≤ 6, there exist possible pairs (S, P) where S or P equals C (e.g., C = 5 allows S = 5).  
   - Valid C values: **7, 9, 11**.  

3. **Possible Triples:**  
   - For **C = 7**: (S, P) pairs: (1, 6), (3, 4), (5, 2).  
   - For **C = 9**: (S, P) pairs: (1, 4), (3, 2).  
   - For **C = 11**: (S, P) pair: (1, 2).  
   - Total valid combinations:  
     (1, 7, 6), (3, 7, 4), (5, 7, 2), (1, 9, 4), (3, 9, 2), (1, 11, 2).  

4. **Pop's Deduction (Unique Solution):**  
   - Pop knows P and infers the unique triple.  
     - If **P = 6**: Only possible triple is (1, 7, 6).  
     - If **P = 4**: Two possibilities: (3, 7, 4) or (1, 9, 4).  
     - If **P = 2**: Three possibilities: (5, 7, 2), (3, 9, 2), (1, 11, 2).  
   - **Only P = 6 leads to a unique solution.**  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - The numbers are **Snap = 1, Crackle = 7, Pop = 6**.  
   - Gretchen identifies this as the only combination where Pop’s number (6) uniquely determines all values.  

**Answer:**  
Snap has 1, Crackle has 7, and Pop has 6. Gretchen deduced this because Pop’s unique number (6) eliminated all other possibilities.",True

123,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Solution: Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room.

1. **Turn Off Two Machines**:  
   The brother enters the room and turns off the local switches of two machines (e.g., Machines 3 and 4). This leaves two machines (1 and 2) running, dependent on their backup switches outside.

2. **Identify Backup Switches for Active Machines**:  
   Outside, he tests all six possible pairs of turning off two backup switches. The correct pair (e.g., Switches A and B) will silence the room, indicating they control the two active machines (1 and 2).

3. **Map Specific Backup Switches**:  
   - He leaves one identified backup switch off (e.g., Switch A) and turns the other on (Switch B).  
   - He re-enters the room:  
     - The machine now off (Machine 1) corresponds to the toggled backup switch (A).  
     - The still-running machine (Machine 2) corresponds to the untouched backup switch (B).

4. **Determine Remaining Backup Switches**:  
   - The two untested backup switches (C and D) must control the initially turned-off machines (3 and 4).  
   - By turning the local switches of Machines 3 and 4 back on, their state depends on their backup switches:  
     - If Switch C is on, Machine 3 runs; if Switch D is on, Machine 4 runs. The brother observes which starts, confirming their mappings.

By reducing active machines, testing combinations, and observing state changes, the brother systematically maps all backup switches to their respective machines.",True
124,"Question: A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?
 Solution: White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Analyze Final Face Colors:**
   - **Top:** Purple (Red + Blue).
   - **Left/Right:** Red with Pink circles (Red + White).
   - **Front:** Black with Gray circle (Black + White).
   - **Back:** Dark Blue (Blue + Black).
   - **Bottom:** Purple with Light Blue circle (Blue + White).

2. **Determine Order Constraints:**
   - **Gray (Black + White) on Front:** White must be applied before Black (step **b** before **c**).
   - **Dark Blue (Blue + Black) on Back:** Blue must precede Black (step **d** before **c**).
   - **Pink (Red + White) on Left/Right:** Red must precede White (step **a** before **b**).
   - **Purple (Red + Blue) on Top/Bottom:** Red must follow Blue (step **a** after **d**).

3. **Resolve Logical Order:**
   - Black (**c**) must come after White (**b**) and Blue (**d**) (due to Gray and Dark Blue).
   - Red (**a**) must come last to avoid overriding permanent Black/Blue layers.
   - This sequence satisfies: **White (b) → Blue (d) → Black (c) → Red (a)**.

4. **Validate Against True Statement:**
   - Exactly one statement is true: **""Blue was added after White.""** This matches the deduced order. Other statements are false.

**Final Order:**  
**White (b) → Blue (d) → Black (c) → Red (a)**.",True
125,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?
 Solution: The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:
F H J K M O Q V W X
U P R E D  I  C A B L
The pairs S-T and Y-Z can each only be placed in one spot here:
F H J K M O Q S V W X Y
U P R E D  I  C T A B L Z
Our 13th pair can now clearly be placed in only one spot:
F G H J K M O Q S V W X Z
U N P R E D  I  C T A B L Y",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.

1. **Determine the Number of Common Letters (X):**  
   Each word (FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, WORLD) must share the same number of letters with the password. Testing possibilities reveals **X = 3** (e.g., assuming fewer/more leads to contradictions in overlapping pairs).

2. **Identify Password Letters for Each Word:**  
   - **QUEST:** Contains 3 password letters. Since S-T are paired (only one can be in the password), and Q-U-E are in separate pairs, the valid triplet is **U, E, T** (excluding Q and S).  
   - **FACE:** Must include **A, C, E** (since F is excluded due to U being in the password).  
   - **QUICK:** Shares **U, I, C** (Q and K are excluded due to C and E being in the password).  
   - **SWITCH:** Shares **I, T, C** (S, W, H are excluded).  
   - **WORLD:** Shares **R, L, D** (W, O excluded due to other pairs).  

3. **Resolve Letter Pairs:**  
   - From the above, password letters include **U, E, T, A, C, I, R, L, D**.  
   - Remaining letters are determined by pairs and ensuring no duplicates: **N (G-N pair), P (H-P), B (B-W), Y (Y-Z)**.  

4. **Construct the Password:**  
   - List ""other"" letters (excluded from the password) alphabetically: **F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Z**.  
   - Map each ""other"" letter to its paired password letter:  
     F→U, G→N, H→P, J→R, K→E, M→D, O→I, Q→C, S→T, V→A, W→B, X→L, Z→Y.  
   - Arrange password letters under sorted ""other"" letters to spell **UNPREDICTABLY**.  

**ANSWER:** The password is **UNPREDICTABLY**.",True
126,"Question: The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.
 Solution: The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.

Available Directors are Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh and Zoltan Pepper.
Available Musicians are Howard Eyeno, Eve O'Looshun, Di O'Bolic and Brighton Early.
Ty Tanick, Howard Eyeno and Eve O'Looshun are Actors.
Winnie DePooh and Brighton Early are Singers.
Howard Eyeno will not sit in the same room with Ty Tanick, and will take part only if Holly Wood is there.
Winnie DePooh refuses to take part with Eve O'Looshun.
Zoltan Pepper refuses to take part with Brighton Early.
How many acceptable groups can the producer put together?
 Solution: There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians. However, some of them are not acceptable, because they do not include both an actor and a singer. This brings the possible combinations down to 36. When you eliminate the combinations that represent people who refuse to work together, you end up with 9.The acceptable groups are:
1) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Howard Eyeno, and Brighton Early;
2) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Eve O'Looshun, and Brighton Early;

8) Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early;
9) Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early.
Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else. Winnie DePooh doesn't get a similar advantage by being the only director/singer because he refuses to work with Eve O'Looshun, which limits his availability. I guess the moral of the story is, be willing to work with anybody and you'll be able to work more.",,"There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians.

1. **Determine Total Possible Groups:**
   - Choose 2 Directors from 5: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \).
   - Choose 2 Musicians from 4: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \).
   - Total groups: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \).

2. **Apply Actor/Singer Requirement:**
   - **Invalid groups (no Actor or no Singer):**
     - *No Actor:* Directors (non-Actors: Holly, Jed, Winnie, Zoltan) + Musicians (non-Actors: Di). Only 6 groups.
     - *No Singer:* Directors (non-Singers: Holly, Jed, Ty, Zoltan) + Musicians (non-Singer: Howard, Eve, Di). 18 groups.
   - **Valid groups:** \( 60 - (6 + 18) = 36 \).

3. **Apply Constraints:**
   - **Howard Eyeno:** Must include Holly if present; cannot pair with Ty.
   - **Winnie DePooh:** Cannot pair with Eve O’Looshun.
   - **Zoltan Pepper:** Cannot pair with Brighton Early.

4. **Evaluate Valid Groups:**
   - Iterate through all Director pairs and Musician pairs, filtering out invalid combinations due to constraints.
   - **Valid groups reduce to 9** after eliminating conflicts.

**Final Answer:**  
The producer can form **9 acceptable groups**.

9. Ty, Winnie, Di, Brighton  

**Key Observations:**  
- Brighton Early appears in 8/9 groups due to being the only Singer Musician with no conflicts.  
- Zoltan Pepper is excluded entirely because his presence blocks Brighton, violating the Singer requirement.  
- Constraints involving Holly, Ty, Winnie, and Eve further restrict valid combinations.",True
128,"Question: One variation of the famous ""Eight Queens Puzzle"" is the ""Bishop Puzzle"".
We know that you can place up to 8 queens on a chessboard with no other pieces in such a fashion that no queen can be taken.  We also know that you can place 32 knights on the board in such a fashion that none can be taken.
Do you know how many bishops you can place on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no piece can be taken?  What is their placement?
 Solution: Fourteen bishops can be placed on the board.
There are a number of solutions for this problem, but the simplest is the following placement.

1. **Understand Bishop Movement**: Bishops move diagonally, so two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. Each bishop remains on squares of the same color (light or dark).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize non-attacking bishops, exploit the two color sets. On each color, arrange bishops such that no two share a diagonal. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on an 8x8 chessboard is **14** (derived from the formula \(2n - 2\), where \(n = 8\)).

3. **Placement Strategy**:
   - **Top Rank (8th Row)**: Place 7 bishops on consecutive squares from **b8 to h8**. This avoids the corner square **a8**, which would conflict with bishops on the first rank.
   - **Bottom Rank (1st Row)**: Place 7 bishops on consecutive squares from **a1 to g1**, plus **h1**. This skips no squares on the first rank, ensuring no two bishops share a diagonal.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Top Rank Bishops**: Each bishop on the 8th rank occupies a unique diagonal (e.g., **b8**’s diagonal doesn’t intersect with **c8**’s).
   - **Bottom Rank Bishops**: Similarly, bishops on the 1st rank occupy distinct diagonals (e.g., **a1** and **b1** don’t attack each other).
   - **Cross-Rank Checks**: No bishop on the 8th rank shares a diagonal with any on the 1st rank (e.g., **b8** and **a1** are not on the same diagonal).

5. **Result**: **14 bishops** (7 on the 8th rank, 7 on the 1st rank) can be placed without mutual attacks. This is the maximum possible due to the diagonal constraints and color separation. 

**ANSWER**:  
The maximum number of bishops is **14**. Place 7 bishops on the 8th rank (b8–h8) and 7 on the 1st rank (a1–h1). This ensures no two bishops share a diagonal.",True
129,"Question: During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces
 Solution: The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**  
   The goal is to determine the largest number of ounces measurable using four weights on a balance scale, where each weight can be placed on either side of the balance or not used. The system must measure every integer ounce from 1 up to the maximum.

2. **Key Insight – Ternary System:**  
   Each weight can occupy three states:
   - On the same side as the gold (subtracting from the total weight needed),
   - On the opposite side (adding to the total weight),
   - Not used.  
   This corresponds to coefficients of \(-1\), \(0\), or \(+1\) for each weight in a balanced ternary number system.

3. **Mathematical Justification:**  
   - With \(n = 4\) weights, there are \(3^n = 81\) total combinations.  
   - Excluding the case where all weights are unused (1 combination), \(81 - 1 = 80\) remain.  
   - Since positive and negative measurements are symmetric, divide by 2: \((3^4 - 1)/2 = 40\).  
   - This formula gives the maximum measurable weight as \(40\) ounces.

4. **Optimal Weights:**  
   The weights must be powers of 3 (\(1\), \(3\), \(9\), \(27\)) to cover all integers in the range \(1\) to \(40\). Each weight allows unique coverage by compensating for gaps in smaller weights. For example:
   - \(2\) oz: \(3 - 1\) (place \(3\) on the opposite side, \(1\) with the gold).  
   - \(7\) oz: \(9 + 1 - 3\) (place \(9\) and \(1\) on the opposite side, \(3\) with the gold).

5. **Verification:**  
   The sum of the weights \(1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\) confirms the maximum measurable value. The balanced ternary system ensures every integer up to \(40\) can be uniquely represented using coefficients \(-1\), \(0\), or \(+1\) for each weight.

**Answer:**  
The largest number of ounces the assessor can measure is **40**, using weights of \(1\), \(3\), \(9\), and \(27\) ounces.",True
130,"Question: Five young ladies (Liz, Marge, Sam, Ella and Jenny) went on five different hiking adventures. Each walked a distance of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 kilometers (random order). Each were able to take an extraordinary wildlife photograph in different locations (forest, meadow, mountain, river side and bushes) of different animals (rabbit, bird, deer, fox and bear cubs).  From the clues below determine where and of what each girl took a photograph of, and the distance each travelled.
1.  Liz walked twice as far as the girl who saw the deer.  The girl who got a shot of the fox travelled one kilometer less than Jenny.  The girl in the bushes was not the one who walked 5 kilometers.  The girl on the riverside walked either one kilometer more or less than the one who was in the bushes.
2.  The girl who was quick enough to capture the rabbit on film walked farther than Marge, but not as far as the one who got the bear cubs.  The girl who hiked up the mountain walked farther than at least one other girl, but not the farthest.  Either Ella or Sam walked more than one kilometer farther than the other.  Sam did not get a picture of the bird.  The mountain climber walked either one kilometer more or less than Marge.
3.  The meadow explorer was not the one to take a picture of the bird.  The bear cubs and the fox were not captured in the forest.  Ella hiked farther than the mountain climber. The girl in the meadow walked one kilometer more or less than the mountain climber.
4.  The girl on the riverside walked two kilometers more than the one who saw the fox.  The deer photographer did not hike as far as Ella, nor as far as the meadow explorer.  At least one traveller walked farther than Jenny.  The girl in the bushes walked either one kilometer more or less than the rabbit photographer.
 Solution: Liz - 6 km, rabbit, riverside

1. **Assign Distances Based on Clues:**
   - From Clue 1: Liz walked twice the distance of the deer photographer. Since distances are 3–7 km, Liz = 6 km (deer photographer = 3 km).
   - Clue 1 also states the fox photographer’s distance = Jenny’s distance -1. Testing valid pairs, Jenny = 5 km (fox = 4 km).
   - Remaining distances: 7 km (unassigned). Ella or Sam must take 7 km (Clue 2: one of them walks >1 km farther than the other).

2. **Link Locations and Distances:**
   - From Clue 1 and 4: Riverside distance = fox’s distance + 2 → fox = 4 km ⇒ riverside = 6 km (assigned to Liz).
   - Bushes location: Adjacent to riverside (Clue 1). Since Liz is 6 km (riverside), bushes = 7 km (assigned to Ella, the remaining distance).
   - Mountain climber’s distance (Clue 2): Not farthest (≠7 km), differs by 1 from Marge. Jenny’s 5 km fits, making her the mountain climber. Marge = 4 km (adjacent to 5 km).

3. **Assign Animals:**
   - Deer photographer = 3 km (Sam, as remaining girl).
   - Fox photographer = Marge (4 km, meadow).
   - Rabbit photographer (Clue 2): Must be >4 km (Marge) but <7 km (bear cubs). Liz (6 km) fits.
   - Bear cubs = Ella (7 km, bushes, not in forest).
   - Bird = Jenny (5 km, mountain), as meadow (Marge) excludes bird.

4. **Finalize Locations:**
   - Sam (deer, 3 km) takes the last location: forest.
   - Validate all adjacency/clue relationships (e.g., meadow-mountain distance difference, bushes-rabbit difference).

**SOLUTION:**  
- **Liz**: 6 km, rabbit, riverside  
- **Marge**: 4 km, fox, meadow  
- **Sam**: 3 km, deer, forest

132,"Question: Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?
 Solution: If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9

Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.

Thus the only remaining solution is: houses 4 and 8.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Total Expected Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of all house numbers (1 to 10) is \( \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55 \).
   - If all 10 houses received mail 3 times, the total weekly sum would be \( 55 \times 3 = 165 \).
   - Actual total delivered sums: \( 18 + 12 + 23 + 19 + 32 + 25 = 129 \).
   - Difference: \( 165 - 129 = 36 \). Since two houses received **no mail**, their combined house numbers must total \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \).

2. **Identify Possible Missing House Pairs:**
   - Possible pairs summing to 12: \( 2+10, 3+9, 4+8, 5+7 \).

3. **Analyze Tuesday (Sum = 12) and Friday (Sum = 32):**
   - **Tuesday (12):** Only combinations of four houses are \( 1+2+3+6 \) or \( 1+2+4+5 \). Both include houses 1 and 2, confirming they received mail.
   - **Friday (32):** Possible combinations are \( 5+8+9+10 \) or \( 6+7+9+10 \). Both include houses 9 and 10, confirming they received mail.

4. **Eliminate Invalid Pairs:**
   - \( 2+10 \) and \( 3+9 \) are invalid because 2, 10, 9 are confirmed to have mail.
   - \( 5+7 \): If excluded, Friday’s sum \( 5+8+9+10 \) is invalid (5 excluded), and \( 6+7+9+10 \) is invalid (7 excluded). Thus, \( 5+7 \) is invalid.

5. **Confirm Remaining Pair (4+8):**
   - Check if all daily sums can be formed without 4 and 8:
     - **Monday (18):** \( 1+3+5+9 \).
     - **Tuesday (12):** \( 1+2+3+6 \).
     - **Wednesday (23):** \( 1+3+9+10 \).
     - **Thursday (19):** \( 1+5+6+7 \).
     - **Friday (32):** \( 6+7+9+10 \).
     - **Saturday (25):** \( 3+5+7+10 \).
   - All sums are valid with houses 4 and 8 excluded.

133,"Question: You are given 14 balls, one of which is marked as a reference ball.  12 of the other balls are the same weight as the reference ball but the other ball may be slightly heavier, slightly lighter or the same weight as the reference ball.  Using a balance scale how can you determine which is the odd ball, if any, with just three weighings?
 Solution: Split the 14 balls into three groups:  one of 4 unknown balls, one of 5 unknown balls and one of 4 unknown plus the reference ball.
1st balance: Balance the two groups of 5 balls.
a) If the balance is not equal, designate the heavy side balls H and the light side balls L.  The group of 4 unbalanced balls must be good balls.
If the 5 unknown is heavier (5 H > 4 L + ref):  take the ref ball, one H, and two L's, and place to one side.
2nd balance:  Balance the remaining balls like this:  2H+L against 2H+L.
a) If the balance is equal, then one of the two L's placed to one side is a light ball or the H placed to one side is a heavy ball.
3rd balance:  Balance the two L's against each other.  If unequal, the lighter side is a light ball.  If equal, the H is a heavy ball.
b) If the 2nd balance is not equal, then either the 2H has the heavy ball or the opposing L is light.
3rd balance: Balance the two H balls from the heavier side against each other.  If equal, then L is a light ball.  If not, the heavier H is a heavy ball.
If the 5 unknown is lighter (5 L > 4 H + ref):  take the ref ball, one L, and two H's, and place to one side.
2nd balance:  Balance the remaining balls like this:  2L+H against 2L+H.
a) If the balance is equal, then one of the two H's placed to one side is a heavy ball or the L placed to one side is a light ball.
3rd balance:  Balance the two H's against each other.  If unequal, the heavier side is a heavy ball.  If equal, the L is a light ball.
b) If the 2nd balance is not equal, then either the 2L has the light ball or the opposing H is heavy.
3rd balance:  Balance the two L balls from the lighter side against each other.  If equal, then the H is a heavy ball.  If not, the lighter L is a light ball.
b) If the first balance is equal, then the odd ball could be in the group of 4 unknown balls.  The other 10 must all be good balls.
2nd balance:  Place one of the 4 unknown balls to one side and balance the remaining three against three good reference balls from the 10 good balls.
a) If the balance is equal, then the ball placed to one side could be the odd ball.
3rd balance:  Balance this ball against a reference to determine if it's good or not.
b) If the 3 unknown are heavier then:  3rd balance:  balance two of the three balls against each other.  If equal, the unbalanced ball is heavy.  If not equal, the heavy side has a heavy ball.
c) If the 3 unknown are lighter then:
3rd balance: balance two of the three balls against each other.  If equal, the unbalanced ball is lighter.  If not, equal the lighter side has a lighter ball.",,"Split the 14 balls into three groups:  one of 4 unknown balls, one of 5 unknown balls and one of 4 unknown plus the reference ball.

     - **Possible Outcomes:**
       - **a) Balanced:** The odd ball is among the 1 H or 2 L set aside.
         - **Third Weighing:** Weigh the two L against each other. If unequal, the lighter is odd; if equal, the H is heavy.
       - **b) Unbalanced:** The odd ball is either the extra H in the heavier side or the L in the lighter side.
         - **Third Weighing:** Weigh the two H from the heavier side. If unequal, the heavier is odd; if equal, the L is light.
   - **If Group B was lighter (5 L vs. 4 H + ref):**
     - Take 1 reference ball, 1 L, and 2 H aside. Weigh 2 L + 1 H against 2 L + 1 H from the remaining balls.

       - **b) Unbalanced:** The odd ball is either the extra L in the lighter side or the H in the heavier side.
         - **Third Weighing:** Weigh the two L from the lighter side. If unequal, the lighter is odd; if equal, the H is heavy.

4. **Second Weighing (Case 2b: Balanced First Weighing):**
   - The odd ball is in Group A (4 unknowns). Take 1 ball from Group A aside and weigh 3 unknowns against 3 reference balls.
   - **Possible Outcomes:**

     - **b) Unbalanced (Heavier/Lighter):** The odd ball is among the 3 weighed unknowns.
       - **Third Weighing:** Weigh two of them. If unequal, the heavier/lighter side reveals the odd ball; if equal, the third is odd.

**Key Logic:**
- Each weighing splits possibilities into thirds, leveraging the balance’s three outcomes.
- The reference ball is used to isolate abnormalities and confirm normal weights.
- Final weighings eliminate possibilities by direct comparison, ensuring the odd ball (if any) is identified in three steps.",True

135,"Question: Heather, her husband, their son, their daughter, and Heather's brother lived together in a house...until yesterday, when one of the five was murdered by one of the other four. Here are some facts that refer only to the five family members:
1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?
 Solution: Heather's brother was murdered.
From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then, from fact 1, Heather's husband and their daughter were at the store, their son was at home, and Heather and her brother were at the park, which means that one of Heather and her brother must have killed the other. But, from fact 3, this cannot work, which means that Heather was at the store.
Suppose the man at the store with Heather was her brother. Then her husband was at the park with one of the two children. Since the husband is obviously older than the children, fact 4 tells us that he could not have killed them. But since he doesn't have a sibling who lives with him, fact 3 tells us he can't be the victim either.
This means that Heather and her son were at the store, her daughter was at home, and Heather's husband and brother were at the park. Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",,"Heather's brother was murdered.

Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Locations and Participants:**
   - Five family members: Heather (F), Husband (M), Son (M), Daughter (F), Heather's Brother (M).
   - Fact 1: A man and woman at the store, murderer and victim at the park, one child at home.
   - Fact 2: Heather and Husband were apart.

2. **Assign Locations Based on Constraints:**
   - Heather and Husband cannot be together (Fact 2).
   - Store requires one man and one woman. Possible pairs: 
     - Heather + Brother (man) **or** Husband + Daughter (woman).
   - If Heather is at the store with Brother, Husband must be at the park with a child (Son/Daughter), and the other child is at home.
   - If Heather is at the store with Son (man), Husband and Brother are at the park, Daughter is home.

3. **Test Scenarios Against Facts:**
   - **Scenario 1 (Heather + Brother at Store):**
     - Park: Husband + Child. 
     - If Husband is victim, murderer is child (younger, valid per Fact 4). 
     - But Fact 3 is trivially satisfied (Husband has no sibling in the house). However, this conflicts with the solution's conclusion, so discarded.
   - **Scenario 2 (Heather + Son at Store):**
     - Park: Husband + Brother.
     - Victim must be Brother (if Husband is murderer, he must be younger than Brother per Fact 4).
     - Fact 3: Victim's sibling is Heather (not the murderer), so valid.

4. **Verify Final Scenario:**
   - Store: Heather + Son.
   - Park: Husband (murderer) + Brother (victim).
   - Home: Daughter.
   - **Fact 3:** Brother’s sibling (Heather) isn’t the murderer.
   - **Fact 4:** Husband (murderer) is younger than Brother (victim).

**ANSWER:** Heather's brother was murdered.",True
136,"Question: 20 cells are arranged in a 5x4 grid.  The cells are occupied by 20 birds (10 different birds, a pair (2) of each).
The cells are labeled as follows:
ABCDE
FGHIK
LMNOP
RSTUW
The birds are: albatross, bunting, cardinal, chickadee, finch, flamingo, hawk, magpie, penguin, and swan.
A bird can only occupy a cell if the cell is labeled with a letter that is in the bird's name.  For example, a hawk can only be in cell: H, A, W, or K.
Each pair of birds must be in the same row or the same column.
Where are the birds located?
 Solution: 1) Determine the locations of the swans.  The only cells that are in the same row/column are in row 4.
2) Determine the locations of the hawks.  One of the cells is eliminated because it is occupied by a swan.  The only remaining cells that are in the same row/column are in row 2.
3) Determine the bird that is in row 1 column 2.  Placing the bunting in that cell will lead to a dead end.  Therefore, an albatross must be in that cell.
4) The remaining cells can be easily filled with the remaining birds.

Row 3: cardinal, magpie, flamingo, flamingo, penguin
Row 4: cardinal, swan, bunting, bunting, swan",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Swan Placement:**
   - Swans can only occupy cells with S, W, A, or N. The only row where both S and W (same row) are available is Row 4. Thus, swans are placed in S and W (Row 4, Columns 2 and 5).

2. **Place Hawks:**
   - Hawks require H, A, W, or K. Since W is occupied by a swan, the remaining valid cells are H, A, and K. To stay in the same row/column, H (Row 2, Column 3) and K (Row 2, Column 5) are chosen (same row).

3. **Resolve Row 1, Column 2 (B):**
   - Bunting or albatross can occupy B. If bunting is placed here, the other bunting must be in Column 2 (G or M), conflicting with magpie. Hence, albatross occupies B, pairing with A (Row 1, Columns 1 and 2).

4. **Fill Remaining Birds:**
   - **Row 1 (A, B, C, D, E):** Albatross (A, B), Chickadee (C, D; valid letters), Penguin (E; pairs with P in Row 3).
   - **Row 2 (F, G, H, I, K):** Finch (F, I; same row), Magpie (G; pairs with M in Row 3), Hawk (H, K).
   - **Row 3 (L, M, N, O, P):** Cardinal (L; pairs with R in Row 4), Magpie (M), Flamingo (N, O; same row), Penguin (P).
   - **Row 4 (R, S, T, U, W):** Cardinal (R), Swan (S, W), Bunting (T, U; same row).

**Final Grid:**
- **Row 1:** Albatross (A), Albatross (B), Chickadee (C), Chickadee (D), Penguin (E)
- **Row 2:** Finch (F), Magpie (G), Hawk (H), Finch (I), Hawk (K)
- **Row 3:** Cardinal (L), Magpie (M), Flamingo (N), Flamingo (O), Penguin (P)
- **Row 4:** Cardinal (R), Swan (S), Bunting (T), Bunting (U), Swan (W)

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each number on the stones (1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12) corresponds to an English word ending in a vowel (e.g., ""one"" ends in ""e"", ""two"" in ""o"", etc.).
2. **Verify Consistency**: Confirm that all given numbers (""one"", ""two"", ""three"", ""five"", ""nine"", ""twelve"") end with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
3. **Determine the Next Number**: After ""twelve"" (12), the next number whose English name ends in a vowel is ""twenty-one"" (21). Numbers between 13-20 and ""twenty"" (20) end in consonants or ""y"" (not considered a vowel here).
4. **Validate Minimality**: 21 is the smallest number greater than 12 with a vowel-ending name, ensuring the sequence follows the established rule.

138,"Question: Ever since Emily began her new job, the last thing she wants to do when she gets home is clean her apartment.  She decided to make a schedule so that she would clean a different room (including the living room) each day (Monday through Friday).  Last week she procrastinated by talking on the phone, so this week, Emily decided to let the answering machine handle  her calls, and she received a different number of messages each day.  Can you determine the which rooms she cleaned each day and the number of messages she received?
Given:
Cleaning Days -- 	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Number of Messages -- 	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Rooms Cleaned -- 	Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen
Clues:
#1) Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.
#2) Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
#3) She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.
#4) Emily cleaned the kitchen on Wednesday.
 Solution: Answers:
Monday -- Bedroom -- 3
Tuesday -- Living Room -- 5
Wednesday -- Kitchen -- 1
Thursday -- Bathroom -- 4
Friday -- Den -- 2
**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.  Looking back at clue 2 gives you the answer for the last section.  She received more messages when cleaning her bedroom than when cleaning the den.  So she received 3 in the bedroom, and 2 in the den.","s:

1. **Identify Fixed Information from Clues:**
   - **Clue #4:** Kitchen is cleaned on Wednesday. Thus, Wednesday's room is Kitchen.
   - **Clue #2:** The sequence of events is: *1 message → Bathroom next day → Den the day after*. The only valid sequence is **Wednesday (1 message) → Thursday (Bathroom) → Friday (Den)**. This assigns Wednesday's messages to 1, Thursday's room to Bathroom, and Friday's room to Den.

2. **Determine Remaining Rooms:**
   - Rooms left for Monday and Tuesday: Bedroom and Living Room.
   - **Clue #1:** Thursday's messages > Bedroom's messages, and Thursday's messages < Tuesday's messages. Since Thursday's messages must be less than Tuesday's, Bedroom cannot be on Tuesday (as it would require Thursday > Tuesday, a contradiction). Thus, **Monday: Bedroom** and **Tuesday: Living Room**.

3. **Assign Messages Using Constraints:**
   - Available messages (excluding Wednesday's 1): 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - **Clue #1 & #3:** Thursday's messages > Bedroom (Monday) and < Tuesday. Bedroom (Monday) > Den (Friday).
   - Logical assignments:
     - Tuesday (Living Room) must have the highest remaining message: **5**.
     - Thursday (Bathroom) must be between Monday and Tuesday: **4**.
     - Monday (Bedroom) must be **3** (since 4 > 3 and 3 > Friday's messages).
     - Friday (Den) is the remaining message: **2**.

4. **Verify All Clues:**
   - **Clue #1:** Thursday (4) > Monday (3) and < Tuesday (5). ✔️
   - **Clue #2:** 1 message on Wednesday → Bathroom (Thu) → Den (Fri). ✔️
   - **Clue #3:** Bedroom (3) > Den (2). ✔️
   - **Clue #4:** Kitchen on Wednesday. ✔️

139,"Question: In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?

Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""

1. **Clue #1 Analysis:**
   - Alex's chapter is between ""Sense of Hume-or"" and ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
   - This creates the sequence: ""Sense"" → Alex → ""Descartes.""
   - Possible positions: ""Sense"" (Ch3), Alex (Ch4), ""Descartes"" (Ch5).

2. **Clue #3 Application:**
   - Kiera's chapter is three after ""Freudian Slippers.""
   - ""Freud"" must be Ch1 or Ch2 (since Ch3+3=6 invalid).
   - If ""Freud"" = Ch2, Kiera = Ch5. This fits with ""Descartes"" as Ch5 (from Clue #1).

3. **Assigning Remaining Titles:**
   - Ch1: Remaining titles are ""Jung At Heart"" or ""I Kant Understand It.""
   - From Clue #2: ""Jung"" must precede Toby. Assign ""Jung"" to Ch1 (before Toby's Ch2 ""Freud"").

4. **Student Assignments:**
   - Ch1 (""Jung"") → Caleb (only remaining student not yet assigned).
   - Ch2 (""Freud"") → Toby (ensures ""Jung"" precedes Toby).
   - Ch3 (""Sense"") → Joan (Clue #4 requires Joan adjacent to ""Kant"").

143,"Question: A particular inn always offers the same nine dishes on its dinner menu: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I. Five foreigners arrive. Nobody tells them which dish corresponds to each letter and so they each select one letter without knowing what they will eat. The innkeeper arrives with the five dishes ordered and puts them in the center of the table so that they can decide who eats what. This goes on for two more nights. The foreigners, who are professors of logic, were able to deduce by the dishes they ordered which letter represents what dish. What could have been the dishes ordered each of the three nights? Note: Each dish was ordered at least once.
 Solution: They could have ordered ABCDD their first night (finding out what D is), AEFGG the second night (finding out what G is and what A is, since they had ordered it the previous night too), and BEHII the third night (finding out what I, B and E are). This leaves C, F and H out, and since they had never ordered these dishes twice, and each came out on a different night, they should know what they are.",,"They could have ordered ABCDD their first night (finding out what D is), AEFGG the second night (finding out what G is and what A is, since they had ordered it the previous night too), and BEHII the third night (finding out what I, B and E are). This leaves C, F and H out, and since they had never ordered these dishes twice, and each came out on a different night, they should know what they are.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Duplicated Dishes Each Night:**  
   Each night, two people order the same dish, allowing the group to recognize it. For example:
   - **Night 1:** Two orders of **D** ⇒ **D** is identified.
   - **Night 2:** Two orders of **G** ⇒ **G** is identified.
   - **Night 3:** Two orders of **I** ⇒ **I** is identified.

2. **Leverage Overlapping Dishes Across Nights:**  
   Dishes ordered in multiple nights help link letters to specific dishes:
   - **A** appears in Night 1 and Night 2 ⇒ The shared dish between these nights is **A**.
   - **B** appears in Night 1 and Night 3 ⇒ The shared dish between these nights (excluding **A**) is **B**.
   - **E** appears in Night 2 and Night 3 ⇒ The shared dish between these nights (excluding **A** and **G**) is **E**.

3. **Assign Unique Dishes to Single-Order Letters:**  
   Letters ordered only once correspond to dishes that appear uniquely in their respective nights:
   - **C** (ordered once in Night 1) ⇒ The remaining unidentified dish from Night 1.
   - **F** (ordered once in Night 2) ⇒ The remaining unidentified dish from Night 2.
   - **H** (ordered once in Night 3) ⇒ The remaining unidentified dish from Night 3.

4. **Verify All Dishes Are Covered:**  
   Each dish (A–I) is ordered at least once, ensuring no ambiguities remain. The final mappings are logically deduced through duplication, overlap, and uniqueness.

**EXAMPLE SOLUTION:**  
- **Night 1:** ABCDD → Identify **D** (duplicated).  
- **Night 2:** AEFGG → Identify **G** (duplicated) and **A** (shared with Night 1).  
- **Night 3:** BEHII → Identify **I** (duplicated), **B** (shared with Night 1), and **E** (shared with Night 2).  
- **Unique Assignments:** **C** (Night 1), **F** (Night 2), **H** (Night 3).

144,"Question: When Chidam got his first car, the first thing he had to do was to get a license plate. When he got his plate, he noticed that the plate had a peculiar number with five digits on it. He also noticed that the numbers could be read upside down, but the value of the number had increased by 78633.
Can you help Chidam find the number of his license plate number?
 Solution: The number of Chidam's license plate is 10968, which is 89601 when inverted.  That is 78633 more than the original number.","There are only 5 digits from 0 to 9 which can be read upside down. The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","The number of Chidam's license plate is 10968, which is 89601 when inverted.  That is 78633 more than the original number.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Valid Digits:** The license plate number consists of digits that can be inverted: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9. The inverted digits map as follows: 0↔0, 1↔1, 6↔9, 8↔8, 9↔6.

2. **Set Up the Equation:** Let the original number be \( ABCDE \). When inverted, it becomes \( E'D'C'B'A' \), where each prime (') denotes the inverted digit. The equation is:  
   \[
   E'D'C'B'A' - ABCDE = 78633
   \]

3. **Analyze Digit Constraints:**  
   - The first digit \( A \) and last digit \( E \) must be non-zero (since \( ABCDE \) and \( E'D'C'B'A' \) are valid five-digit numbers).  
   - \( E' \) (first digit of the inverted number) must correspond to a valid non-zero inverted digit. This restricts \( E \) to 1, 6, 8, or 9.

4. **Solve Digit-by-Digit with Carries:**  
   - **Units Place:** \( E + 3 \equiv A' \mod{10} \). Test valid pairs:  
     - \( E = 8 \), \( A' = 1 \) (since \( 8 + 3 = 11 \), carryover 1). Thus, \( A = 1 \).  
   - **Tens Place:** \( D + 3 + 1 \equiv B' \mod{10} \). Solve for \( D = 6 \), \( B' = 0 \), so \( B = 0 \).  
   - **Hundreds Place:** \( C + 6 + 1 \equiv C' \mod{10} \). Solve for \( C = 9 \), \( C' = 6 \).  
   - **Thousands Place:** \( B + 8 + 1 \equiv D' \mod{10} \). \( B = 0 \), so \( D' = 9 \), matching \( D = 6 \).  
   - **Ten-Thousands Place:** \( A + 7 \equiv E' \mod{10} \). \( A = 1 \), so \( E' = 8 \), matching \( E = 8 \).

5. **Verify the Solution:**  
   Original number: \( 10968 \). Inverted number: \( 89601 \).  
   Difference: \( 89601 - 10968 = 78633 \), which satisfies the condition.

145,"Question: You have 2 fuses. One fuse burns for 1 hour, the other burns for 2 hours. The problem is that the fuses burn irregular. The last few inches may burn longer than first few inches. Using the 2 fuses how can you create a fuse that burns for exactly 45 minutes. Remember, cutting them does no good since you don't know how long the cut fuse lasts.
 Solution: You burn both sides of the 1 hour fuse and 1 side of the 2 hour fuse at the same time. Regardless of the varying speeds of the one hour fuse, when it goes out it has been 30 minutes. At that point there would be 1 hour and 30 minutes left on the 2 hour fuse. You then light the other end of the 2 hour fuse and since the burning time would be cut in half the fuse would be 45 minutes long.",,"You burn both sides of the 1 hour fuse and 1 side of the 2 hour fuse at the same time.

You then light the other end of the 2 hour fuse and since the burning time would be cut in half the fuse would be 45 minutes long.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to measure exactly 45 minutes using two irregular-burning fuses (1-hour and 2-hour). Cutting is ineffective due to uneven burn rates.

2. **Key Insight:** Burning a fuse from both ends halves its total burn time, regardless of irregularity. This principle applies even if the fuse burns unevenly.

3. **Procedure:**
   - **Step 1:** Light both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse simultaneously.
   - **Step 2:** The 1-hour fuse burns out in 30 minutes (half its total time). At this moment:
     - The 2-hour fuse has burned for 30 minutes from one end, leaving 90 minutes of unburned fuse remaining.
   - **Step 3:** Immediately light the unburned end of the 2-hour fuse. Now, it burns from both ends, halving the remaining time: 90 minutes ÷ 2 = 45 minutes.
   - **Step 4:** The 2-hour fuse burns out 45 minutes after the second end is lit. This 45-minute interval (from the 30-minute mark to the 75-minute total) provides the exact measurement.

4. **Logical Consistency:**
   - Burning both ends of the 1-hour fuse guarantees a 30-minute interval.
   - The 2-hour fuse’s remaining burn time after 30 minutes (90 minutes) is halved to 45 minutes when ignited from both ends.
   - No reliance on cutting or uniform burn rates; only the total burn time and simultaneous ignition are critical.

**Final Answer:** By burning both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse, then lighting the second end of the 2-hour fuse when the first fuse extinguishes, you measure 45 minutes.",True

What is Mad Ade's house number?
 Solution: Mad Ade's house number is 76.
From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.

Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Analyze Each Conditional Statement:**
   - **Clue 1:** If the house number is a multiple of 3, it must be between 50-59. This restricts multiples of 3 in this range to 51, 54, 57. Non-multiples of 3 in 50-59 must comply with other clues.
   - **Clue 2:** If the house number is not a multiple of 4, it must be between 60-69. Non-multiples of 4 outside 60-69 are invalid.
   - **Clue 3:** If the house number is not a multiple of 6, it must be between 70-79. Non-multiples of 6 outside 70-79 are invalid.

2. **Eliminate Invalid Ranges:**
   - **50-59 Range:** Numbers here must be multiples of 4 (to satisfy Clue 2) and multiples of 6 (to satisfy Clue 3). However, no numbers in 50-59 are multiples of both 4 and 6, so this range is eliminated.
   - **60-69 Range:** Numbers here must not be multiples of 3 (to satisfy Clue 1) and must be multiples of 6 (to satisfy Clue 3). No numbers in 60-69 meet both criteria, eliminating this range.

3. **Focus on 70-79 Range:**
   - Numbers here must not be multiples of 3 (to satisfy Clue 1) and must be multiples of 4 (to satisfy Clue 2). This leaves **72** and **76**.
   - **72** is a multiple of 3 (invalid). **76** is not a multiple of 3 and is a multiple of 4. It also satisfies Clue 3 (not a multiple of 6, so it must be in 70-79).

4. **Verification:**
   - **76** satisfies all conditions:
     - Not a multiple of 3, so Clue 1 holds.
     - A multiple of 4, so Clue 2 holds.
     - Not a multiple of 6 and in 70-79, so Clue 3 holds.

148,"Question: There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
 Solution: Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

1. **First Weighing: Divide and Compare**
   - Divide the 12 coins into three groups (G1, G2, G3) of 4 coins each.
   - Weigh G1 against G2.
     - **If balanced**: The fake coin is in G3. Proceed to Step 2A.
     - **If unbalanced**: Note which group is heavier/lighter. The fake is in G1 or G2. Proceed to Step 2B.

2A. **Second Weighing (If G1 and G2 Balanced):**
   - Take 3 coins from G3 and weigh against 3 known real coins (from G1/G2).
     - **If balanced**: The fake is the unweighed coin in G3. Proceed to Step 3A.
     - **If unbalanced**: Note the tilt direction to determine if the fake is lighter/heavier. Proceed to Step 3B.

3A. **Third Weighing (Identify Single Fake in G3):**
   - Weigh the remaining unweighed coin from G3 against a real coin. The tilt reveals if it is lighter/heavier.

3B. **Third Weighing (Identify Fake Among 3 Coins):**
   - Take 2 coins from the 3 suspected in G3 and weigh them against each other.

     - **If unbalanced**: The tilt direction matches the fake’s property (lighter/heavier) to identify it.

2B. **Second Weighing (If G1 and G2 Unbalanced):**
   - Let the heavier group be A and lighter group B. Weigh [2A + 1B] vs. [2A + 1B].
     - **If balanced**: The fake is among the 2 unweighed coins in B (lighter). Proceed to Step 3C.
     - **If unbalanced**: Note the new tilt direction. Proceed to Step 3D.

3C. **Third Weighing (Identify Fake in Remaining 2 of B):**
   - Weigh the 2 unweighed coins from B. The lighter one is fake.

3D. **Third Weighing (Identify Fake Based on New Tilt):**
   - If the left side was heavier in Step 2B:
     - The fake is either one of the 2A coins on the left (heavier) or the 1B coin on the right (lighter).
     - Weigh the 2A coins against each other.
       - **If balanced**: The fake is the 1B coin (lighter).
       - **If unbalanced**: The heavier A coin is fake.
   - Similar logic applies if the right side was heavier.

**Key Logic:**
- Each weighing splits possibilities and tracks tilt direction to infer the fake’s weight.
- Reusing known real coins and redistributing suspected coins isolates the fake efficiently.
- Final weighing(s) resolve ambiguity by comparing narrowed-down candidates.",True
149,"Question: Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:
Room A: small, borders rooms B and E
Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?
 Solution: HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter
In either scenario, the mother's and the sister's rooms are the same size. And from fact 2, the sister is the lead.",,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.

1. **Identify Gender Constraints:**
   - There are two men (HEF Jr. and his son) and three women (sister, mother, daughter).
   - Fact 4 requires every room to border at least one man and one woman. 

2. **Assign Genders to Rooms:**
   - Room B (large, central) must be occupied by a man to satisfy adjacency requirements for multiple rooms.
   - Rooms D and E must both be occupied by women (deduced from gender parity and adjacency rules).
   - Rooms A and C are assigned to the remaining man (HEF Jr.) and woman (sister).

3. **Check Fact 3 (No Adjacency for HEF Jr. and Daughter):**
   - Assign HEF Jr. to Room A (small) and daughter to Room D (small). These rooms do not border each other, satisfying the constraint.

4. **Verify Fact 1 (Lead and Sibling’s Room Borders):**
   - Lead actor and sibling must have rooms with equal border counts. Sister (Room C, 2 borders) and HEF Jr. (Room A, 2 borders) match.

5. **Confirm Fact 2 (Lead and Parent’s Room Size):**
   - Sister (lead) is in Room C (large), and her parent (mother) is in Room E (large), fulfilling the same-size requirement.

**Conclusion:** The lead actor is **HEF Jr.'s sister**.",True
150,"Question: There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?
 Solution: The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:

1. **Base Case Analysis:**
   - **1 Lion:** The lion eats the sheep, becomes a sheep, and faces no threat (no other lions). **Sheep is eaten.**
   - **2 Lions:** If either lion eats the sheep, it becomes a sheep. The remaining lion would then eat the transformed sheep (as in the 1-lion case). Since neither lion wants to be eaten, **neither acts**, and the **sheep survives**.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - For **N Lions**, the decision hinges on whether **N** is **even** or **odd**:
     - **Odd N:** A lion eats the sheep, becoming a sheep. This leaves **N−1** (even) lions. From the prior step, an even number of lions will **not eat** the sheep, so the transformed lion survives. Thus, the original lion **safely eats the sheep**.
     - **Even N:** If a lion eats the sheep, it becomes a sheep, leaving **N−1** (odd) lions. Odd lions will eat the transformed sheep (as per the inductive rule). The original lion avoids this outcome by **not eating the sheep**.

3. **Application to 100 Lions:**
   - **100 is even.** The first lion realizes that eating the sheep would leave **99 lions (odd)**, who would then eat the transformed sheep. To avoid being eaten, the lion **refrains from eating** the sheep. All lions reason identically, leading to the **sheep remaining untouched**.

**Conclusion:** When the number of lions is even (as in 100), the sheep survives. When odd, the sheep is eaten. The parity of the lion population determines the outcome through backward induction.",True

153,"Question: In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).
 Solution: Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.

1. **Base Case Analysis:**  
   If only 1 person were nominated, that person would see no others and come forward on the first night. Since no one came on the first night, all villagers deduce \( N \geq 2 \).

2. **Inductive Step:**  
   Each subsequent night without a claimant increments the minimal possible \( N \). For example:
   - If \( N = 2 \), each nominee would see 1 other and infer \( N = 2 \) after the first night’s silence. They would come forward on the second night.
   - Since no one came on the second night, \( N \geq 3 \). This pattern repeats daily.

3. **Day 29 Elimination:**

4. **Conclusion on Day 30:**  
   All nominees see 29 others. Knowing \( N \geq 30 \) (from Day 29’s silence) and observing exactly 29 nominees, they conclude \( N = 30 \). Thus, all 30 nominees come forward on the 30th night.

154,"Question: One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'

Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!

1. **Identify Key Clues in the Poem:**
   - The punishment occurs during a ""Repast of Right"" (a meal).
   - The phrase ""one for two"" implies disproportionate retribution (greater punishment than the crime).
   - ""No more shall they breathe"" indicates the kids will die.
   - The group are not cannibals, ruling out literal human children being eaten.

2. **Analyze Wordplay:**
   - ""Kids"" can refer to young goats (livestock) instead of human children. This aligns with the non-cannibalistic context.

3. **Connect Context to Punishment:**
   - Old Man Justice and his group ""eat the kids"" (goats) as ""justice served,"" symbolizing retribution for the theft.
   - Killing and consuming the goats ensures they ""trouble no more"" (death), fulfilling the poem’s threat.

4. **Interpret the Phrase ""One for Two"":**
   - The punishment exceeds the crime’s harm (Old Man was injured, not killed). Killing goats instead of human children represents an escalated, non-proportional response (""one for two"").

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The three stolen ""kids"" (young goats) are cooked and eaten at the dinner. This serves as symbolic justice, resolves the theft, and avoids cannibalism through deliberate wordplay.",True

1. **Determine Valid Times:** The hour hand aligns with a minute mark at times where minutes (M) are multiples of 12: \( M = 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 \).
2. **Set Up Equation:** The minute hand (position \( M \)) must be 1 mark ahead of the hour hand (position \( 5H + \frac{M}{12} \)). For \( M = 12k \), this gives:
   \[
   12k = 5H + k + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 11k = 5H + 1.
   \]
3. **Solve for Integer \( H \):** Check \( k = 0,1,2,3,4 \):
   - Only \( k = 1 \) yields \( H = 2 \), leading to \( M = 12 \).
4. **Result:** Time is \( 2:12 \).

**Problem 2: Minute hand is on the previous line before the hour hand.**

1. **Same Valid Times:** Use \( M = 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 \).
2. **Set Up Equation:** The minute hand (position \( M \)) must be 1 mark behind the hour hand:
   \[
   12k = 5H + k - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 11k = 5H - 1.
   \]
3. **Solve for Integer \( H \):** Check \( k = 0,1,2,3,4 \):
   - Only \( k = 4 \) yields \( H = 9 \), leading to \( M = 48 \).
4. **Result:** Time is \( 9:48 \).

**Key Observations:**
- The hour hand moves \( \frac{1}{12} \) of a minute mark per minute, aligning with marks every 12 minutes.
- Equations balance the positions of the hands with modular constraints to ensure integer solutions.",True

160,"Question: Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?
 Solution: The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.

1. **Identify the Ratios from the Will:**
   - If the child is a boy: Son (Manny) gets 2/3, Widow (Faerie) gets 1/3.  
     **Ratio (Son : Widow) = 2 : 1**  
   - If the child is a girl: Widow gets 2/3, Daughter (Goodie) gets 1/3.  
     **Ratio (Widow : Daughter) = 2 : 1**

2. **Combine the Ratios for Twins:**  
   The will’s logic implies two key proportional relationships:  
   - Widow’s share = ½ of Son’s share (from the boy condition).  
   - Widow’s share = 2 × Daughter’s share (from the girl condition).  

   Combining these:  
   - **Son : Widow : Daughter = 4 : 2 : 1**  
   (Since Widow = ½ Son and Widow = 2 × Daughter → Son = 4 × Daughter).

3. **Calculate Total Shares:**  
   Total parts = 4 (Son) + 2 (Widow) + 1 (Daughter) = **7 parts**.  

4. **Divide the Estate Proportionally:**  
   - Son: \( \frac{4}{7} \)

1. **Total Ribbons per Rose:**
   - Total ribbons = 28. Each rose has a unique count.
   - From clue 2: **Pretty in Pink (PiP)** = 7 ribbons (¼ of 28).
   - From clue 5: **Yummy Yellow (YY)** = 1 ribbon (1 blue).
   - Clue 2 also implies **RR + SS + YY = 7** → **RR + SS = 6** (since YY = 1).

2. **Determine RR and SS Totals:**
   - **RR** must be divisible by 4 (clue 4). Possible values ≤6: **RR = 4**, so **SS = 2** (since RR + SS = 6).

   - **MTT + VV = 14** (remaining ribbons after PiP, YY, RR, SS).
   - From clue 3: **VV = MTT + SS** → **VV = MTT + 2**.
   - Substitute into **MTT + VV = 14**: **MTT = 6**, **VV = 8**.

4. **Assign Blue and Red Ribbons:**
   - **RR** (4 total): ¾ red → **3 red, 1 blue**.
   - **MTT** (6 total): ⅓ blue → **2 blue, 4 red**.
   - **PiP** (7 total): Let PiP’s blue = x. From clue 7, **VV’s blue = x**.
   - From clue 8: **VV’s red = MTT’s red + RR’s red = 4 + 3 = 7** → **VV’s total = 8 = x (blue) + 7 (red)** → **x = 1**.

You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""
 Solution: The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.

We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:

Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.
(P.S. Sorry if this offended anybody, not that I think it would, but in my other teaser people were complaining so I'm just putting this in here for warning).",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Valid First Set (Clues 5 & 6):**  
   The first set must be a two-digit square number without 0, 3, or 6. Possible options: 25, 49, 81.

2. **Determine Second Set Using Clue 3:**  
   Reverse-engineer the second set from the first set:  
   - For 25: \( (25 - 7)/2 = 9 \) (invalid, contains 0).  
   - For 81: \( (81 - 7)/2 = 37 \) (invalid, contains 3).  
   - For 49: \( (49 - 7)/2 = 21 \).  
   **Second set = 21.**

3. **Establish Third and Fourth Sets (Clues 2, 4, 5):**  
   - Third set + 13 = Fourth set.  
   - Fourth set’s digit sum > First set’s digit sum (13).  
   - All missing digits (5, 7, 8) must appear in these sets.  

   **Possible valid pairs:**  
   - 75-88: Third set sum = 12 (valid for Clue 1), Fourth set sum = 16 (>13). Includes 5,7,8.  

4. **Verify All Clues:**  
   - **Combination:** 49-21-75-88.  
   - Clue 1: Third set sum = 7 + 5 = 12 ✔️  
   - Clue 2: 88 - 75 = 13 ✔️  
   - Clue 3: \( 21 \times 2 + 7 = 49 \) ✔️  
   - Clue 4: 16 > 13 ✔️  
   - Clue 5: No 0,3,6; all other digits present ✔️  
   - Clue 6: 49 is a square ✔️  

**Final Answer:**  
The winning combination is **49-21-75-88**.",True

165,"Question: There are three students Anu, Bob and Coy. They have exactly three books - one on Physics, one on Chemistry and one on Math. Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.
 Solution: All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.

Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.

Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,

166,"Question: Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.
 Solution: Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.  Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.

1. **Initial Situation:**  
   - Grobi is at the center (Point A) after completing one east jump (6 inches east to Point B).  
   - The mushroom is 6 inches west of A (Point M).  
   - Rule 7 requires Grobi to complete **four jumps in the current direction (east)** before changing direction.

2. **Completing the East Series:**  
   - Grobi must finish the remaining three east jumps (minimum 6 inches each) to fulfill the four-jump requirement:  
     - Jump 2: 6 inches east → total 12 inches east of A.  
     - Jump 3: 6 inches east → total 18 inches east of A.  
     - Jump 4: 6 inches east → total 24 inches east of A.  
   - Now, Grobi has completed the four-jump series east and can change direction.

3. **Final Jump West:**  
   - From 24 inches east of A, Grobi jumps **30 inches west** (within the 6–72 inch limit) to land exactly at the mushroom’s location (-6 inches west of A).  

4. **Route Breakdown:**  
   - **3 jumps east** (6 inches each) to comply with the four-jump rule.  
   - **1 jump west** (30 inches) to reach the mushroom.  
   - Total: **4 jumps** after locating the mushroom.  

**Answer:**  
Grobi jumps **three times east (6 inches each)** to complete the required series, then **once west (30 inches)** to land atop the mushroom.

From the statements below, which two knights went to seek the dragon?
1. If neither Sir William or Sir Vincent rode out, then Sir Calvin did.
2. If either Sir Calvin or Sir Vincent went to kill the dragon, then Sir Andrew did not.
3.  If neither Sir Andrew or Sir William were of the brave two that left the kingdom, then Sir Charles was.

3. **Apply Statement 3**: If neither Andrew nor William are in the pair (Andrew is excluded, William’s status is unknown), Charles must be included. Since Vincent is already in, the second knight must be Charles to satisfy this.

4. **Verify Statement 4**: If neither Luke nor Andrew went (true here), Vincent must be included (already true). This is satisfied.

1. **Identify the Pattern:** The addresses on Braingle Street are derived by converting the initials of the resident's relationship to the speaker into Roman numerals.
   - **Example 1:** ""My Mother Vera"" → Initials M (My), M (Mother), V (Vera) → MMV (2005).
   - **Example 2:** ""My Cousin Lucy"" → Initials M (My), C (Cousin), L (Lucy) → MCL (1150).

2. **Determine the Speaker’s Address:** The speaker’s address uses their own relationship term (""Me"" or ""I"").
   - **Option 1:** ""Me"" → M (My), E (Me). However, Roman numerals lack ""E,"" so use ""M"" (for ""Me"") → M = 1000.
   - **Option 2:** ""I"" → Directly corresponds to the Roman numeral I = 1.

169,"Question: Mad Ade's cousin Steve lies a lot. He tells the truth on only one day in a week.
One day he said: ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.""
The next day he said: ""Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.""
The next day he said: ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.""
On which day of the week does Steve tell the truth?
 Solution: Mad Ade's cousin  Steve tells the truth on Tuesdays
The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth. But, they have no such day in common. Therefore one of them must be true, and the other must refer to that day. Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",,"Mad Ade's cousin  Steve tells the truth on Tuesdays

Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Constraints:** Steve tells the truth only one day a week, lying on the other six days. He made three statements on three consecutive days.

2. **Analyze Statements:**
   - **Day 1:** ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.""
   - **Day 2:** ""Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.""
   - **Day 3:** ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.""

3. **Test Possible Truth Days:**
   - If **Day 1** were true, Steve would lie on Mondays and Tuesdays, contradicting itself (truth cannot occur on these days).
   - If **Day 3** were true, Steve would lie on Fridays and Wednesdays, but this must align with the first statement’s implications.
   - **Day 2** must be a lie (since only one true statement exists), narrowing the valid days.

4. **Eliminate Inconsistent Days:**
   - Day 2’s falsehood implies the actual day is not Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.
   - This leaves Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday as possible days for the three consecutive statements.

5. **Check Consistency for Remaining Days:**
   - Assume the three days are **Sunday, Monday, Tuesday**:
     - **Day 1 (Sunday):** Lie. ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays"" is false → Steve does not lie on both days. Since he tells the truth on **Tuesday**, this holds.
     - **Day 2 (Monday):** Lie. ""Today is Sunday/Saturday/Thursday"" is false (correct, as it’s Monday).
     - **Day 3 (Tuesday):** Truth. ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays"" is true (Steve lies on all days except Tuesday).

170,"Question: The last contestant has just completed the cycling leg of the triathlon.  The 15 clues that follow are with respect to this point in the race.  From the clues you must determine:  the color of shorts each runner is wearing, the positions at the end of the cycling leg, and the final standings.
Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.
4) The runner in the orange shorts took over the lead.
5) Ethan and the runner in the green shorts switched places.
6) David moved ahead of Brian, who was not wearing the blue shorts.
7) Chuck stubbed his toe, lost one position, and was now just ahead of Alvin.
8) Ethan and Brian, neither one who wore the violet shorts, switched places.
9) Alvin moved ahead of the runners who wore the green and orange shorts.
10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.
12) Chuck moved ahead of the runner who wore the orange shorts.
13) With a burst of speed, David moved ahead of Ethan, Frank, and the runner in the yellow shorts.
14) Ethan moved ahead of the runner who wore the red shorts.
15) Out of breath, the runner wearing the green shorts fell behind Brian, who now trailed the runner wearing the yellow shorts.  No further position changes occur.  The race ends.
 Solution: Set up a grid of names versus colors.  From the clues, mark off combinations that can not exist.  From this, it can be found that Brian wears orange.  This leaves Ethan wearing blue.  From Clue 7 and Clue 9, Chuck can only be orange or green.  From Clue 12, Chuck can not be orange, therefore he must be green.  This leaves David wearing red, Frank wearing violet, and Alvin wearing yellow.  This establishes:  Alvin = yellow, Brian = orange, Chuck = green, David = red, Ethan = blue, Frank = violet
To determine the final results, work backward, substituting names for colors.  From Clue 15, Alvin beats Brian beats Chuck.  From Clue 14, Ethan beats David.  From Clue 13, David beats Frank beats Alvin.  This establishes the final results as:  Ethan, David, Frank, Alvin, Brian, Chuck.
Now work backward to determine the cycling standings, substituting names for colors.  You need to determine what the standings would have had to have been prior to each clue.  Before Clue 15:  Ethan, David, Frank, Alvin, Chuck, Brian.  Before Clue 14:  David, Ethan, Frank, Alvin, Chuck, Brian.  Before Clue 13:  Ethan, Frank, Alvin, David, Chuck, Brian.

1. **Assign Short Colors:**
   - **Clue 4:** Orange shorts took the lead → Brian (since he moves up and interacts with red).
   - **Clue 8:** Neither Ethan nor Brian wears violet → Frank = violet.
   - **Clue 5 & 14:** Ethan swaps with green and overtakes red → Ethan = blue, David = red.
   - **Clue 15 & 9:** Brian trails yellow (Alvin) and leads green (Chuck) → Alvin = yellow, Chuck = green.
   - **Final Colors:** Alvin (yellow), Brian (orange), Chuck (green), David (red), Ethan (blue), Frank (violet).

2. **Determine Final Standings (After All Clues):**
   - **Clue 15:** Order: Yellow (Alvin) > Brian (orange) > Chuck (green).
   - **Clue 14:** Ethan (blue) > David (red).
   - **Clue 13:** David (red) > Frank (violet) > Alvin (yellow).
   - **Combine:** Final order: **Ethan (1st), David (2nd), Frank (3rd), Alvin (4th), Brian (5th), Chuck (6th).**

3. **Reverse Clues to Find Initial Cycling Positions:**
   - Start from final standings and undo each clue backward:
     - **Clue 15 Reverse:** Chuck moves up to 5th, Brian to 6th.
     - **Clue 14 Reverse:** David moves ahead of Ethan.
     - Continue reversing all clues until reaching the initial order:
     - **Initial Cycling Order:** **David (1st), Ethan (2nd), Alvin (3rd), Brian (4th), Frank (5th), Chuck (6th).**

**Key Logical Steps:**
- **Color Assignment:** Eliminate possibilities using exclusivity and direct clues (e.g., Brian = orange via Clue 4).
- **Final Standings:** Deduce via consecutive positional relationships (e.g., Ethan > David > Frank > Alvin > Brian > Chuck).
- **Initial Positions:** Reverse-engineer movements by treating each clue as reversible (e.g., moving Brian back two places for Clue 1).

**Final Answer:**
- **Short Colors:** Alvin (yellow), Brian (orange), Chuck (green), David (red), Ethan (blue), Frank (violet).
- **Cycling Positions:** 1. David, 2. Ethan, 3. Alvin, 4. Brian, 5. Frank, 6. Chuck.

171,"Question: Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?
 Solution: Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.

Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Calculate Total Weight:**  
   The total weight of all six cheese pieces is \(15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 31 = 119\) pounds.

2. **Determine Modular Constraint for Chillirella:**  
   Let \(C\) be the weight of the Chillirella. The total Kebabrie weight is \(119 - C\).  
   Norma’s purchase (\(N\)) and Laura’s purchase (\(L = 2N\)) sum to \(3N\). Thus:  
   \[
   3N = 119 - C \implies 119 - C \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.
   \]  
   Since \(119 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\), \(C \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\). The only weight satisfying this is **20 pounds**.

3. **Verify Feasibility of Purchases:**  
   If \(C = 20\), the Kebabrie weights are \(15, 16, 18, 19, 31\).  
   - Norma buys two pieces: \(15 + 18 = 33\) pounds.  
   - Laura buys three pieces: \(16 + 19 + 31 = 66\) pounds (twice Norma’s weight).  
   This matches the requirement \(3N = 99\) (since \(119 - 20 = 99\)).

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The remaining Chillirella weighs **20 pounds**.  

**Final Answer:**  
The Chillirella weighs \(\boxed{20}\) pounds.",True
172,"Question: Twelve men are in a room, some of them always tell lies, while the others always tell the truth.
The first man says: ""None of us is a truthteller.""
The second man says: ""At most one of us is a truthteller.""
The third man says: ""At most two of us are truthtellers.""
...
The twelfth and last man says: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers.""
Who are the liars?
 Solution: If there are exactly N liars, then the last N men are truthtellers, leaving the first (12-N) men to be liars.
Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.","It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","If there are exactly N liars, then the last N men are truthtellers, leaving the first (12-N) men to be liars.
Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Statements and Truth-Tellers (T):** Each man in position \( k \) states ""At most \( k-1 \) truth-tellers."" Truth-tellers must have \( T \leq k-1 \), while liars must have \( T > k-1 \).

2. **Assume \( N \) Liars:** Let \( N \) be the number of liars. Then, truth-tellers \( T = 12 - N \). Liars occupy positions \( 1 \) to \( N \), and truth-tellers occupy \( N+1 \) to \( 12 \).

3. **Truth-Tellers’ Constraints:** For every truth-teller in position \( k \geq N+1 \), \( T \leq k-1 \). Substituting \( T = 12 - N \), the smallest \( k = N+1 \) gives \( 12 - N \leq (N+1) - 1 \), leading to \( N \geq 6 \).

4. **Liars’ Constraints:** For every liar in position \( k \leq N \), \( T > k-1 \). The most restrictive case (largest \( k = N \)) gives \( 12 - N > N - 1 \), leading to \( N \leq 6 \).

5. **Solve for \( N \):** Combining \( N \geq 6 \) and \( N \leq 6 \), we find \( N = 6 \). Thus, the first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 are truth-tellers.

173,"Question: A man has 3 cards face down on a table.  One is a jack and two are aces.  He knows the order but you do not.  You can ask him one yes or no question, but when you do, you have to point to one of the cards.  If you point to an ace, he will tell the truth, if you point to the jack, he will randomly say yes or no.  You have to find one of the aces.
 Solution: Point to the middle card and say,  ""Is the card to the right an ace?""  If the answer is yes, then the card on the right is an ace. If the answer is no, the card on the left is an ace.  This solution works because if you're pointing to an ace then he's obviously telling the truth and if you're pointing to the jack the answer doesn't matter anyway because you will pick one of the other two which are both aces.","Yes, there is always a chance you will be pointing to the jack, and that the answer will be meaningless (just a random yes/no) but there is a way to work around it.

If the answer is no, the card on the left is an ace.  This solution works because if you're pointing to an ace then he's obviously telling the truth and if you're pointing to the jack the answer doesn't matter anyway because you will pick one of the other two which are both aces.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Setup:** There are three cards (two aces, one jack) in a row. The man knows their positions. You can ask one yes/no question while pointing to a card. Truthful answer if pointed to an ace; random (yes/no) if pointed to the jack.

2. **Choose the Middle Card:** Point to the middle card to maximize coverage. If it's an ace, truthful answers can guide you; if it's the jack, the other two cards are aces, making the answer irrelevant.

3. **Formulate the Question:** Ask, *""Is the card to the right an ace?""*  
   - **If Middle is an Ace:**  
     - **Yes Answer:** Right card is an ace (truthful).  
     - **No Answer:** Right card is the jack (truthful), so left card must be an ace.  
   - **If Middle is the Jack:**  
     - Both left and right cards are aces. Whether the answer is yes/no (random), choosing left or right based on the answer still selects an ace.

4. **Determine Final Choice:**  
   - If answer is **Yes**, pick the right card.  
   - If answer is **No**, pick the left card.  
   This guarantees selecting an ace regardless of whether the middle card was an ace or the jack.  

**Key Insight:** By pointing to the middle card, the question leverages either truthful information (if middle is an ace) or bypasses randomness (if middle is the jack, where both remaining cards are aces). This ensures a valid ace is always identified.",True

(Also everything has been so far in alphabetical order so it has to be ""EMW"", not EWM, MEW, MWE, WME, or WEM.)",DSReason,solutionSummary,"1. **Identify the Pattern**: The problem involves determining a sequence of letters where each row's letters are constructed with an increasing number of straight lines. The first row (L, T, V, X) uses **2 straight lines per letter**, and the second row (A, F, H, K, N, Z) uses **3 straight lines per letter**. 

2. **Determine the Next Step**: Following the pattern, the third row should use letters formed with **4 straight lines**. Possible candidates are analyzed: **E** (4 lines: vertical + 3 horizontals), **M** (4 lines: two peaks with diagonals), and **W** (4 lines: two inverted peaks with diagonals).

3. **Verify Alphabetical Order**: The first two rows follow alphabetical order (L-T-V-X and A-F-H-K-N-Z). The third row must also follow this rule. Among 4-line letters (E, M, W), alphabetical order is **E → M → W**.

1. **Identify Door Types:**
   - **Entrances:** A, F, and one of C, D, E (determined to be E in the solution).
   - **Exits:** B, C, D (remaining two after assigning E as entrance).

2. **Alternation Constraint:**
   - The prisoner’s path must alternate between exits and entrances, starting with an exit (since they leave the cell first). Sequence: Exit → Entrance → Exit → Entrance → Exit → Entrance.

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - Use the given door-following rules (e.g., after A, go to B or E) to build valid connections.

4. **Construct the Path:**
   - Start with an exit (C, D, or B). Testing possibilities:
     - **Starting with C (exit):**
       - C → F (entrance, allowed since C can go to F).
       - F → D (exit, allowed since F can go to D).
       - D → A (entrance, allowed since D can go to A).
       - A → B (exit, allowed since A can go to B).
       - B → E (entrance, allowed since B can go to E).
     - Resulting path: **C → F → D → A → B → E**.

5. **Validation:**

B, The latest time of the year is 17:56:43 09/28",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

**Problem Analysis:**  
We need to determine the earliest and latest dates/times in the format `HH:MM:SS MM/DD` where all digits 0-9 appear exactly once. Each component (hours, minutes, seconds, month, day) must adhere to valid ranges.

---

**Steps for (a) Earliest Date/Time:**

1. **Month Selection:**  
   - Choose the earliest valid month with unique digits. March (`03`) is viable (digits `0, 3`).

2. **Day Selection:**  
   - Select the earliest day in March with digits not overlapping with the month. Day `26` (digits `2, 6`) works.

3. **Time Construction:**  
   - Use remaining digits `1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9` for `HH:MM:SS`.  
   - Earliest valid time: `17:48:59` (digits `1,7,4,8,5,9`).

**Result:**  
Digits used: `0,3` (month), `2,6` (day), `1,7,4,8,5,9` (time). All digits 0-9 appear once.  
**Earliest Date/Time:** **March 26, 17:48:59** (`03/26 17:48:59`).

---

**Steps for (b) Latest Date/Time:**

1. **Month Selection:**  
   - Choose the latest valid month with unique digits. September (`09`) is viable (digits `0, 9`).

2. **Day Selection:**  
   - Select the latest day in September with digits not overlapping with the month. Day `28` (digits `2, 8`) works.

3. **Time Construction:**  
   - Use remaining digits `1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7` for `HH:MM:SS`.  
   - Latest valid time: `17:56:43` (digits `1,7,5,6,4,3`).

**Result:**  
Digits used: `0,9` (month), `2,8` (day), `1,7,5,6,4,3` (time). All digits 0-9 appear once.

182,"Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?
 Solution: Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of Citrate and half of Sildenafil. Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile.

1. **Divide the Mistaken Pills:**
   - You have three pills: 1 Sildenafil (S) and 2 Citrate (C). Cut each into two equal halves. This results in 6 halves: 2 halves of S and 4 halves of C.

2. **Create Two Initial Piles:**
   - Split the 6 halves into two piles (A and B), ensuring each pile contains 3 halves. Since the pills are indistinguishable, each pile will naturally contain:
     - **0.5 S** (from the original S pill) and **1.0 C** (0.5 from each of the two C pills).

3. **Introduce an Additional Sildenafil Pill:**
   - Retrieve a new S pill from the bottle, cut it into two halves, and add one half to each pile. Now:
     - **Pile A:** 0.5 S (original) + 0.5 S (new) = **1 S** and 1.0 C.
     - **Pile B:** 0.5 S (original) + 0.5 S (new) = **1 S** and 1.0 C.

4. **Dose Correctly:**
   - Each pile now contains **1 full S pill** and **1 full C pill** (formed by combining halves). Consume one pile today and save the other for tomorrow.

**Result:** You meet the daily requirement of 1 S and 1 C without wasting pills. The additional S pill is accounted for across two days, ensuring proper dosage.",True
183,"Question: The first chess tournament ended. Bab, Beb, Bib, Bob and Bub became good friends, and returned to their houses.
They told their wives about the tournament. Their wives were also chess players, and they decided to hold another tournament.
This time, each of the 10 players was going to play against each other player once, with an exception that no games were played between the couples. So a total of 40 games would be played.
After some days passed, they decided to have a get-together. Bub asked the other people how many matches until then they had played.
Something fun was that Bub heard 9 different answers.
How many matches until then had Mrs. Bub played?
 Solution: Each player could play at most 8 matches, so the answers Bub heard was 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in some order.
Assume without loss of generality that it was Bab that had played 8 matches. Then all players except Mrs. Bab must have played against Bab, and it must have been Mrs. Bab who had played no matches.

1. **Determine Possible Answer Range:** Each player can play 0 to 8 matches (excluding their spouse). Bub hears 9 distinct answers, which must be 0, 1, 2, ..., 8.

2. **Establish Couple Pairings:** For each couple, the number of matches played by one spouse plus the number played by the other equals 8 (since they cannot play each other). This creates pairings: (8,0), (7,1), (6,2), (5,3), and (4,4).

3. **Assign Values to Couples:** Assign the highest remaining value to a player, then their spouse must have the complementary value. For example:
   - A player with 8 matches implies their spouse has 0.
   - A player with 7 matches implies their spouse has 1.
   - Continue this pattern until the last couple, which must both have 4 matches (since 4 + 4 = 8).

4. **Identify Mrs. Bub’s Matches:** Since all other pairs (8-0, 7-1, etc.) are already assigned to distinct couples, the only remaining pairing is (4,4). Bub’s spouse (Mrs. Bub) is part of this last couple, so she must have played **4 matches**.

184,"Question: Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan live in four adjacent apartments. The apartments are set up like this:
|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.
4. If Dan lives east of Al, then Ben is the landlord and he lives in apartment 2.
Who is the landlord?
 Solution: Carl is the landlord.
Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan. Then either Al lives east of both Carl and Dan (contradicting fact 4) or Carl and Dan both live east of Al (contradicting fact 2.) So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.","All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. If the hypothesis of such a statement is false, the whole statement is true. If the conclusion is true, the whole statement is true. However, if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, the statement is false. This means that each statement has either a false hypothesis or a true conclusion.","Carl is the landlord.
Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan.

1. **Identify Constraints from Each Conditional Statement:**
   - Only one conclusion (landlord assignment) can be true.
   - Each conditional's hypothesis must align with its conclusion if the hypothesis is true.

2. **Assume All Conclusions Are False:**
   - This leads to contradictions (e.g., Ben must live next to both Carl and Dan, creating an impossible arrangement).

3. **Test Each Conclusion Individually:**
   - **Conclusion 1 (Al in 1):** Leads to contradictions with other conditionals (e.g., Dan east of Al forces Ben as landlord).
   - **Conclusion 2 (Dan in 4):** Results in Ben and Dan not being adjacent, conflicting with other hypotheses.
   - **Conclusion 4 (Ben in 2):** Forces Carl to also be a landlord, violating uniqueness.

4. **Focus on Conclusion 3 (Carl in 3):**
   - **Hypothesis:** Ben and Dan are not adjacent.
   - **Valid Arrangement:** 
     - Dan (1), Al (2), Carl (3), Ben (4).
     - Carl (3) is next to Ben (4), satisfying ""Carl next to Ben"" (hypothesis of statement 1 is false).
     - Al (2) is west of Carl (3), making the hypothesis of statement 2 false.
     - Dan (1) is west of Al (2), making the hypothesis of statement 4 false.
     - Ben (4) and Dan (1) are not adjacent, validating the hypothesis of statement 3, thus confirming Carl as landlord.

186,"Question: Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?
 Solution: To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",,"To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again.

This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**  
1. **Determine the time until clocks realign**:  
   - Each clock diverges at 20 seconds/hour (10 gained + 10 lost).  
   - To show the same time again, their difference must reach 12 hours (43,200 seconds).  
   - Time required: \( \frac{43,200 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ seconds/hour}} = 2,160 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ days} \).  

2. **Calculate the date 90 days after January**:  
   - If set on **January 31** in a **non-leap year**, 90 days later is **May 1**.  
   - In a **leap year**, 90 days from January 31 would land on **April 30** (due to February having 29 days).  

3. **Link to Smoe’s birthday**:  
   - The reunion occurs on Smoe’s 47th birthday in **May**, so the year must be **non-leap**.  
   - If Smoe were born in **1933**, his 47th birthday would be in **1980** (a leap year), conflicting with the required May 1 date.  
   - Thus, Smoe must be born in **1932** (47th birthday in **1979**, a non-leap year).  

**Conclusion**: Smoe, born in **1932**, is older than Joe, born in **1933**.",True

1. **Initial Setup:** Start with jugs A and B each containing 10 liters, and jugs C and D empty.  
   - **Goal:** Use transfers between jugs to create precise measurements without spilling.

2. **Create 1 Liter in Jug A:**  
   - **Step 1:** Pour 9 liters from A to D (A:1, D:9).  
   - **Step 3:** Transfer A’s remaining 1 liter to D (A:0, D:1).  
   - **Purpose:** Establish a small measurable quantity (1 liter) for later steps.

3. **Transfer and Redistribute to Free Up Space:**  
   - **Step 4:** Pour 8 liters from B to D (B:2, D:9).  
   - **Step 5:** Empty D into A (A:9, D:0).  
   - **Step 6:** Transfer 1 liter from A to C (A:8, C:10).  
   - **Goal:** Use D to temporarily hold water, freeing B and A for further transfers.

4. **Build Intermediate Quantities:**  
   - **Step 7-8:** Move 2 liters from B to D, then 7 liters from C to D (C:3, D:9).  
   - **Step 9-10:** Transfer 2 liters from D to A (filling A) and 7 liters from D to B.  
   - **Purpose:** Reset jugs to enable precise pours for the final measurements.

5. **Isolate 1 Liter in A and 4 Liters in D:**  
   - **Step 11-12:** Pour 9 liters from A to D (A:1, D:9), then transfer A’s 1 liter to C (C:4).  
   - **Step 13-15:** Move D’s 9 liters to A, adjust between A and B, and fill D again.  
   - **Step 16-20:** Transfer remaining water to achieve B:10 (full), then finalize D to 4 liters.  
   - **Result:** A holds 1 liter, D holds 4 liters.  

**Logical Flow:**  
- Use the 9-liter jug (D) to break down 10-liter quantities.  
- Repeatedly transfer water to create residual amounts (1 liter, 2 liters, etc.).  
- Combine partial transfers to incrementally reach the target measurements.  
- Final steps consolidate the required volumes by redistributing water between all jugs.  

**Key Insight:** Strategic pouring between jugs allows leveraging their capacities to derive exact amounts through iterative subtraction and redistribution.",True

You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.
 Solution: The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

   The code uses digits **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9** (no 5 or 7).

2. **Locate the 66 (Clue 7 & Clue 8):**  
   - Clue 7 states one set is **66**.  
   - Clue 8 restricts the **8** to the last set.  
   - Since 66 contains no 8, it must be in the **third set** (??-??-66-??).

3. **Determine the Second Set (Clues 1 & 4):**  
   - From Clue 1: The third set’s first digit (6) + second set’s second digit < 8 → second set’s second digit must be **1**.  
   - From Clue 4: Second set × 4 = reversed fourth set.  
   - Possible second sets ending in 1: **21** (21 × 4 = 84 → fourth set reversed is **48**).  
   - Second set = **21**, fourth set = **48**.

4. **Solve the First Set (Clues 3, 5, 6):**  
   - Clue 6: Product of first set’s digits is 21–29.

190,"Question: A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?
 Solution: Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Agree on Parity:** Beforehand, all prisoners agree to use the parity (even or odd) of the total number of black hats as their reference. For concreteness, assume they choose *even* parity.

2. **Observe Others’ Hats:** Each prisoner counts the number of **black hats** they see on the other prisoners.

3. **Calculate Own Hat Color:**
   - If a prisoner counts an **odd** number of black hats, they deduce their own hat must be **black** to make the total parity **even**.
   - If they count an **even** number of black hats, they deduce their own hat must be **white** to preserve the total parity as **even**.

4. **Outcome Determination:**
   - **If the actual total parity matches the agreed parity (even):** All prisoners guess correctly, as their deductions align with the true total.
   - **If the actual total parity is opposite (odd):** All prisoners guess incorrectly, as their deductions invert their actual hat colors.

5. **Warden’s Limitation:** The warden cannot control both parity outcomes simultaneously. Regardless of the parity he chooses, the prisoners’ coordinated strategy ensures they are either all correct or all wrong, satisfying the escape condition. 

**Key Insight:** The shared parity assumption allows prisoners to synchronize their guesses. Each prisoner’s guess indirectly communicates information about the total parity through their observation, ensuring collective success or failure.",True

This leaves The Rusting Bucket and The Devine Lightning for Berrick and Derek. Going to rule #8, Eric already has The Golden Pleasure, so if Berrick gets The Devine Lightning, then Derek can have The Rusting Bucket. This gives us the following that complies with rules 8 & 9:
Eric = The Golden Pleasure
Merick = The Silver Dream
Berrick = The Devine Lightning
Derek = The Rusting Bucket

192,"Question: Thirty fans hire a bus to attend a football game. On the way to the stadium, they realize that exactly half of them are fans of one team and the other half are fans of the other team. With still some way to go before reaching the stadium, the bus develops mechanical problems and the driver announces to his passengers that the only way to continue the journey is for half of them to get out and walk. There is a huge fight that doesn't stop until the driver speaks to them again and suggests a way of selecting the passengers who are to get off the bus.
""All of you,"" he said, ""get into a big circle. When you are ready, beginning at this spot, I'll count nine people clockwise. The ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. Then I'll count another nine starting from where I stopped, and the ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. And so on until fifteen people have left the circle.""
Suppose that you are one of the fans. How should you arrange all the other fans of your team so that none of them will have to leave?
 Solution: If the two teams are A and B and you are a supporter of team A and don't want any of your fellow supporters to end up walking to the stadium, organize them in a circle starting at the point where the driver starts and reading clockwise as follows: A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, B, A, A, B, A, A, A, B, A, B, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, B, B, A, A, B.",,"If the two teams are A and B and you are a supporter of team A and don't want any of your fellow supporters to end up walking to the stadium, organize them in a circle starting at the point where the driver starts and reading clockwise as follows: A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, B, A, A, B, A, A, A, B, A, B, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, B, B, A, A, B.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Elimination Pattern:** The problem requires arranging 30 fans (15 from each team) in a circle such that when every 9th person is counted and eliminated, all 15 eliminated are from team B. This resembles the Josephus problem with step size 9 and 30 people.

2. **Determine Elimination Order:** Simulate the elimination process to identify the positions (0 to 29) that will be eliminated first. The first 15 eliminated positions must be occupied by team B.

3. **Simulate Step-by-Step Elimination:**
   - Start at position 0. The first eliminated is position 8 (count 9 people: 0-8).
   - Continue counting from the next position after each elimination. For example:
     - After eliminating position 8, count resumes at 9. The next eliminated is position 17.
     - Continue this process iteratively, reducing the circle size by 1 each time, until 15 people are eliminated.

4. **Identify Safe Positions:** The remaining 15 positions (not eliminated) are the safe spots for team A. These positions are determined by avoiding the elimination sequence.

5. **Construct the Arrangement:**
   - Place team B fans in the 15 positions that will be eliminated (e.g., 8, 17, 26, 5, 15, 25, 6, 18, 29, 11, 23, 7, 21, 4, 20 in the example).
   - Fill the remaining positions with team A fans. The specific arrangement provided ensures that every 9th count lands on a B, sparing all A fans.

**Final Arrangement Logic:**  
By strategically positioning team B fans in the elimination sequence derived from the Josephus problem with step size 9, team A fans occupy all safe positions. The given solution’s sequence (e.g., alternating blocks of A and B at calculated intervals) ensures that every 9th count always targets a B fan, leaving all A fans unharmed.",True
193,"Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...
 Solution: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.

1. **Understand the Problem Mechanics**: Each blow toggles the state of a lantern and its two neighbors. The goal is to extinguish all seven lanterns arranged in a circle.  
   - **Key Insight**: Blowing a lantern is commutative (order doesn’t matter), and blowing it twice cancels its effect.  

2. **Model the Problem Mathematically**:  
   - Represent each lantern’s state as a binary variable (1 = lit, 0 = extinguished).  
   - Each lantern must be toggled an **odd number of times** (since they start lit and need to end extinguished).  
   - Set up a system of linear equations modulo 2, where each equation corresponds to a lantern being toggled by itself and its two neighbors.  

3. **Solve the System of Equations**:  
   - The system reveals that blowing **every lantern exactly once** satisfies all equations:  
     - Each lantern is toggled **three times** (once by itself and twice by its neighbors).  
     - Three toggles (an odd number) extinguish every lantern.  

4. **Verify the Solution**:  
   - Blowing each lantern once (7 total steps) ensures all lanterns are extinguished.  
   - Order of blows doesn’t matter due to commutativity.  

5. **Conclusion**: The minimal solution requires **blowing each lantern once** (7 steps total).  

**ANSWER**: Blow each of the seven lanterns exactly once in any order. This toggles every lantern three times, extinguishing them all.",True

1. Peter doesn't use the same combination on two days of this week.
2. Peter doesn't use the same colour on two consecutive days of this week.
3. Peter uses some colour on four days.
4. Peter uses blue and black on Monday.
5. Peter uses green on Thursday.

1. **Identify the Four-Day Color:**
   - Rule 3 states one color is used on four days. Since days must be non-consecutive (Rule 2), the days are **Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday**.
   - From Rule 4 (Monday: blue + black), the four-day color must be **blue** (black is invalid due to Rule 7 constraints).

2. **Assign Blue’s Partners:**
   - Blue pairs with **black (Monday)**, then needs three unique partners: red, yellow, green (Rule 1).
   - Rule 5 (green on Thursday) means green cannot pair with blue on Wednesday or Friday (Rule 2). Thus:
     - Wednesday: **blue + yellow**
     - Friday: **blue + red**
     - Sunday: **blue + green**.

3. **Thursday’s Combination:**
   - Thursday uses green (Rule 5). Possible partners: red, yellow, or black.
   - **Green + black** is chosen (avoids red/yellow conflicts with adjacent days).

4. **Tuesday’s Combination:**
   - Excludes blue/black (Rule 2 after Monday). Options: red, yellow, green.
   - **Red + green** is valid (no consecutive color conflicts and unique combination).

5. **Saturday’s Deduction:**
   - Excludes colors from Friday (blue, red) and Sunday (blue, green) via Rule 2.
   - Available colors: **yellow + black** (only unused combination, no Rule 7 violation).

1, There were 9 men and children.
2, There were 2 more women than children.
3, The number of different man-woman couples possible was 24. Note that if there were 7 men and 5 women, then there would have been 35 man-woman couples possible.
Also, of the three groups - men, women and children - at the party:
4, There were 4 of one group.
5, There were 6 of one group.
6, There were 8 of one group.
Exactly one of the above 6 statements is false.
Can you tell which one is false? Also, how many men, women and children are there at the party?
 Solution: Statement (4) is false. There are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children.

1. **Analyze the Statements:**
   - Statements 1, 2, 3 relate to relationships between men (M), women (W), and children (C).
   - Statements 4, 5, 6 assign specific counts (4, 6, 8) to the groups. Exactly one of all six statements is false.

2. **Assume Statements 1, 2, 3 Are True:**
   - **Statement 1:** \( M + C = 9 \).
   - **Statement 2:** \( W = C + 2 \).
   - **Statement 3:** \( M \times W = 24 \).

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Substitute \( W = C + 2 \) into \( M \times W = 24 \), and use \( C = 9 - M \):
     \[
     M \times (9 - M + 2) = 24 \implies M^2 - 11M + 24 = 0.

1. **Assign Blue Squares First:**
   - Place all 4 blue (B) squares such that each row and column contains exactly one blue. This forms a Latin square pattern. In the solution, blues are positioned at (1,2), (2,4), (3,1), and (4,3).

2. **Fill Remaining Cells with Other Colors:**
   - For the remaining 12 cells, distribute red (R), white (W), green (G), and yellow (Y) such that each color appears exactly 3 times. Ensure no repetition in rows, columns, or diagonals.

3. **Use Cyclic Permutation to Avoid Conflicts:**
   - Rotate the order of colors in each subsequent row. For example:
     - Row 1: W, B, G, R  
     - Row 2: R, Y, W, B (shifted from Row 1’s last color)  
     - Row 3: B, G, R, Y (continuing the shift)  
     - Row 4: Y, W, B, G  
   - This cyclic pattern ensures uniqueness across rows and columns.

4. **Verify Diagonals and Final Counts:**
   - Check both main diagonals (e.g., top-left to bottom-right: W, Y, R, G; other diagonal: R, W, G, Y) for uniqueness.
   - Confirm counts: Blue = 4, others = 3 each. All rows, columns, and diagonals have distinct colors.

**Final Arrangement:**

199,"Question: I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.
 Solution: Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.

Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.

1. **Identify Possible Outcomes per Round:**
   - Each round's outcome (win/loss) affects card counts and determines the next server.
   - Track card changes based on serving/receiving rules.

2. **Case 1: Win First Round (I Serve):**
   - **Round 1:** I win → 7 cards (me), 3 cards (Tweeto).  
     *Next server: Me.*  
   - **Round 2:** I lose → 6 cards (me), 4 cards (Tweeto).  
     *Next server: Tweeto.*  
   - **Round 3:** Tweeto wins → 4 cards (me), 6 cards (Tweeto).  
     *Tweeto wins Round 3 (Statement C true). Total wins for Tweeto: 2 (Statement A true).*

3. **Case 2: Lose First Round (I Serve):**
   - **Round 1:** I lose → 4 cards (me), 6 cards (Tweeto).  
     *Next server: Tweeto.*  
   - **Round 2:** Tweeto loses → 5 cards (both).  
     *Next server: Me.*  
   - **Round 3:** I lose → 4 cards (me), 6 cards (Tweeto).  
     *Tweeto wins Round 3 (Statement C true). Total wins for Tweeto: 2 (Statement A true).*

200,"Question: Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?
 Solution: Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",,"Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Phil's Current Location:** Phil is not in Madadia anymore. He recently moved away and is watching the rain in his hometown through a news report on TV.  
   - *Logical Consistency:* The problem states Phil is ""watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town,"" implying he observes it remotely, not experiencing it firsthand.

2. **Weather at Phil's New Location:** The area where Phil and Norma currently reside is sunny, unaffected by Madadia's floods.  
   - *Logical Consistency:* Norma’s indifference stems from the rain not impacting their immediate environment.

3. **Norma's Lack of Connection to Madadia:** Norma is not from Madadia, so she has no personal attachment to the town or its issues.  
   - *Logical Consistency:* Her dismissive reaction (""could really care less"") aligns with having no emotional or practical stake in the distant problem.

4. **Conclusion:** The couple’s physical separation from Madadia and Norma’s unrelated background explain her apathy. The crisis is irrelevant to their current situation.  

**Answer:**  
Phil was watching a news report about Madadia from a different, sunny location. Norma, not being from Madadia and unaffected by its floods, saw no reason to care.",True

1. **Place Dog in A2 (Clue 4):**  
   Dog is fixed at position A2. Adjacent cells (A1, B2, A3) cannot be Tiger (Clue 7).

2. **Determine Monkey’s Position (Clue 6):**  
   Monkey must be above (A1) or below (A3) Dog. Testing A3:  
   - Monkey in A3 forces Horse into row 3 (Clue 3).  
   - Place Horse in C3 to align with column C’s shared initial (Clue 2).

3. **Assign Row 3 Animals:**  
   - Row 3: Monkey (A3), Mouse (B3), Horse (C3).  
   - Mouse fills B3, ensuring two M-initials in row 3 (Monkey, Mouse) for Clue 2.

4. **Assign Bear and Hamster (Clue 1):**  
   Place Bear (A1) and Hamster (C1) in row 1.  
   - Cat occupies B1 (remaining animal in row 1).  

5. **Place Lion and Tiger (Clue 5):**  
   - Cat in B1 (row 1) requires Lion or Tiger below.  
   - Lion in B2, Tiger in C2 (row 2), satisfying “below Cat” and avoiding Tiger adjacent to Dog (Clue 7).  

6. **Verify Column C for Shared Initials (Clue 2):**  
   - Column C: Hamster (C1, H), Horse (C3, H). Two H-initials satisfy Clue 2.

```
Row 1: Bear   | Cat    | Hamster  
Row 2: Dog    | Lion   | Tiger  
Row 3: Monkey | Mouse  | Horse  
```  
**Key Logic:**  
- Dog’s placement anchors the grid.  
- Monkey and Horse in row 3 allow shared initials (M and H).  
- Strategic placement of Lion/Tiger avoids adjacency conflicts and satisfies “below Cat.”  
- Shared initials in row 3 (M) and column C (H) resolve Clue 2.",True

It was widely known that this Minister [M] told the truth to reporters [R] only once in every three statements.
M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.
While others jostled to ask the next question, one logically minded newshound was already leaving with the hot headline news.
From the Minister's three statements above, can you also deduce the truth?
 Solution: It was a tax increase.
Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.

1. **Statement Analysis:**
   - **Statement 1:** ""It's about subsidies."" (If true, the change is subsidies-related.)
   - **Statement 2:** ""Nothing is going down."" (If true, no decreases occur; only increases.)
   - **Statement 3:** ""Subsidies ↓ or wages ↑."" (A logical OR; true if either occurs.)

2. **Assume Statement 1 is True:**
   - The change involves subsidies (either ↑ or ↓).
   - If subsidies ↑:
     - Statement 2 (""Nothing ↓"") becomes true → **two truths** (contradiction).
   - If subsidies ↓:
     - Statement 3 (""Subsidies ↓ or wages ↑"") becomes true → **two truths** (contradiction).
   - **Conclusion:** Statement 1 must be false. The change is **not about subsidies** (so taxes or wages).

3. **Assume Statement 3 is True:**
   - Since Statement 1 is false, ""subsidies ↓"" is false. Thus, ""wages ↑"" must be true.
   - If wages ↑:
     - Statement 2 (""Nothing ↓"") becomes true → **two truths** (contradiction).
   - **Conclusion:** Statement 3 must be false.

4. **Only Statement 2 Can Be True:**
   - ""Nothing is going down"" → the change is an **increase** (wages or taxes).
   - If wages ↑:
     - Statement 3 (""wages ↑"") would also be true → **two truths** (contradiction).

203,"Question: There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?
 Solution: 89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.

1. **Identify the Losing Position:**  
   Determine the critical number of eggs that, if left to the opponent, guarantees a win. This number is **101** because any move the opponent makes (taking 1–100 eggs) allows you to take the remaining eggs (101 – their move) to win.

2. **Establish Multiples of 101:**  
   The game reduces to forcing the opponent to face multiples of **101**. Each turn, you aim to leave **101 × k** eggs (where **k** is an integer). After each of your turns, the total decreases by 101 eggs (your move + opponent’s move).

3. **Calculate the Largest Multiple of 101 ≤ 2008:**  
   Divide 2008 by 101:  
   \( 2008 ÷ 101 ≈ 19.88 \).  
   The largest integer **k** is 19, so \( 19 × 101 = 1919 \).

4. **Determine the Initial Move:**  
   Subtract this multiple from the total eggs:  
   \( 2008 - 1919 = 89 \).  
   By taking **89 eggs** initially, you leave **1919 eggs** (a multiple of 101).

5. **Perfect Play Strategy:**  
   After your initial move, every time the opponent takes **y** eggs (1 ≤ y ≤ 100), you take \( 101 - y \) eggs. This ensures the total decreases by 101 each round, maintaining multiples of 101 until the opponent is forced to face 101 eggs. You then take the last egg(s) to win.

1. **Eric's Initial Claim:** Eric knows the product and claims to know the numbers. For this to be true, the product must uniquely identify one triplet. However, if the product is **0**, multiple triplets (with a 0) exist, making Eric’s claim false. This implies the actual product is **0**, and Eric lied.

2. **Consecutive Digits Clue:** The triplet must contain two consecutive numbers. After this clue, Luke is told one number. If Luke’s number is **0**, the only valid triplet with consecutive digits and sum 11 is **0, 5, 6** (since 0 + 5 + 6 = 11, and 5 & 6 are consecutive).

3. **Luke’s Conclusion:** If Luke is told **0**, he deduces the triplet must be **0, 5, 6**. Since the product is 0 (non-unique without the consecutive clue), Eric couldn’t have known the numbers. Luke thus confirms Eric lied.

Tim, who posted either 2 or 3 RBIs, ended up with 1 error more than the pitcher after he (Tim) quite literally dropped the ball.
Seventh Inning
The player who finished with no RBIs and 2 errors, including fumbling a fly ball, doesn't play 3rd base.
Eighth Inning
The player who had his 3 RBIs with a game-tying in-the-park home run that had the fans on their feet, scored at least 1 error, but he had fewer errors than the shortstop.
Ninth Inning
K.C. ended the game with 2 fewer errors than the catcher, who let a wild pitch get past him so that the Peaches regained the lead.
Can you determine which position the boys played, as well as how many runs batted in (RBI) and errors they made?

207,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
Three travelers, Al, Ben and Carl, came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote five three-letter words on a rock. The five words were HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
Then the troll asked Al, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Al, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Ben, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Ben, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Carl, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Carl, and the troll let him pass.
So, what is the password?
 Solution: The password was HOE.
The only letters unique to one of the five words were D, H, P, R, and V. One of these letters must have been Al's, since he could determine the password. The only word without any of these letters is TOE. So the password could not have been TOE.
Ben knew this and now had four words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, P, R, T, and V. The password must have contained at least two unique letters, one for Al and the other for Ben, since they were both able to determine the password. The only word with only one of these letters was OAR. So OAR could not have been the password.
Carl knew this and now had three words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, O, P, T, and V. The password must have included three of these letters, since all three were able to determine the password. The only one of the three words containing three such letters was HOE, so this must have been the password.","1. Ben used Al's answer, and Carl used both Al's and Ben's answers.

1. **Identify Unique Letters in Each Word:**
   - The five words are HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, VAT.
   - Unique letters (appearing in only one word): H (HOE), R (OAR), P (PAD), D (PAD), V (VAT). TOE has no unique letters (T is in VAT, O and E in other words).

2. **Al’s Immediate Deduction:**
   - Al knew the password instantly, meaning he received a unique letter (H, R, P, D, V). This eliminates TOE (no unique letters), leaving HOE, OAR, PAD, VAT.

3. **Ben’s Deduction After TOE is Eliminated:**
   - Ben now knows TOE is invalid. The remaining words’ unique letters: H, E (HOE), R (OAR), P, D (PAD), V, T (VAT). 
   - OAR is eliminated because Ben must have received a unique letter. OAR only has R as unique, but if Ben had R, he’d know OAR. However, if the password were OAR, Ben could not deduce it if he received O or A (non-unique letters), contradicting his certainty. Thus, OAR is invalid.

4. **Carl’s Final Deduction:**
   - Remaining words: HOE, PAD, VAT. Unique letters after OAR’s elimination: H, O, E (HOE), P, D (PAD), V, T (VAT).
   - For Carl to know the password, his letter must uniquely identify one word. HOE is the only word where all three letters (H, O, E) are unique post-elimination. PAD and VAT include the non-unique letter A, which would leave ambiguity if Carl received A.

**Conclusion:** The password is **HOE**, as it’s the only word where all three letters are uniquely identifiable after eliminations, allowing all travelers to deduce it stepwise.",True

Adam was born in 1309 of the Muslim calendar, Ben 1310 in the Christian calendar and Cyril 1311 in the Jewish calendar. Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify the Different Calendars:**  
   Each individual uses a distinct calendar system:
   - **Adam:** Muslim (Hijri) calendar (starts in 622 CE).
   - **Ben:** Christian (Gregorian) calendar.
   - **Cyril:** Jewish calendar (starts in 3761 BCE).

2. **Convert Birth Years to a Common Timeline (Gregorian):**  
   - **Adam (1309 AH):** 1309 Hijri ≈ 1891 CE (exact conversion varies slightly, but roughly late 19th century).  
   - **Ben (1310 CE):** Directly 1310 CE (14th century).  
   - **Cyril (1311 Jewish):** 1311 Jewish year = 1311 - 3761 = **-2450** (2450 BCE).  

3. **Calculate Time Gaps:**  
   - Cyril (2450 BCE) lived **~3760 years** before Ben (1310 CE).  
   - Ben (1310 CE) lived **~581 years** before Adam (1891 CE).  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Despite sharing consecutive birth years in their own calendars, their actual lifespans in Gregorian years are millennia apart. Thus, they never coexisted in the same era to cross paths.

1. **Identify Generations:** Assume two generations (older parents and younger children) since no grandchildren are mentioned. All married couples are heterosexual and present.

2. **Assign Older Generation:**
   - **Maria** and **Clarissa** are placed in the older generation as spouses (wives).
   - **Jonathan** and **Theodore** are brothers in the older generation (Jonathan marries Clarissa, Theodore marries Maria).

   - **Donna** and **Judy** are sisters (daughters of Jonathan and Clarissa).
   - **Ben** and **Christopher** are brothers (sons of Theodore and Maria).

4. **Map Statements to Relationships:**
   - **Statement 1 (Donna):** Donna is Maria’s niece (Maria is her aunt via marriage to Theodore, Jonathan’s brother).
   - **Statement 2 (Ben):** Christopher is his only cousin (incorrect in the user’s logic, as cousins should be Donna/Judy, but attributed to trial-and-error).
   - **Statement 3 (Theodore):** Clarissa is his brother’s wife (Jonathan’s wife).
   - **Statement 4 (Judy):** She is Donna’s sister (both daughters of Jonathan/Clarissa).
   - **Statement 5 (Christopher):** Jonathan is his uncle (Jonathan is Theodore’s brother).
   - **Statement 6 (Jonathan):** Theodore is his brother.
   - **Statement 7 (Maria):** Ben is her nephew (Ben is her son, but ""nephew"" implies a sibling’s child; inconsistency here).
   - **Statement 8 (Clarissa):** Judy is her daughter (matches parentage).

5. **Final Assignments via Elimination:**

214,"Question: John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?
 Solution: The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:
1. heart, heart, club
spade, spade, club
diamond, diamond, club
2. heart, heart, diamond
spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
3. spade, spade, diamond

heart, heart, diamond
club, club, diamond
5. diamond, diamond, heart
club, club, heart
spade, spade, heart
6. diamond, diamond, spade
club, club, spade
heart, heart, spade
Game 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit. Games 5 and 6 cannot be possible because no one had both hearts and spades. This leaves only games 2, 3, and 4, which all have diamonds as the high suit.","This makes the puzzle too easy.

1. **Analyze the first trick constraints:**  
   - The first leading suit cannot be clubs because John, Paul, and George all hold clubs, which would force three players to play clubs, violating the trick structure (exactly two leading suit cards required).  
   - Possible first leading suits: hearts, spades, or diamonds.  

2. **Test possible high suits for each leading suit:**  
   - **If first leading suit is hearts:**  
     - Players John (1 heart) and George (2 hearts) can follow.  
     - Paul and Ringo cannot follow. They must play the high suit if possible.  
     - **High suit options:**  
       - **Clubs:** Paul has a club and would play it (high suit), but this forces a third trick conflict (see step 3).  
       - **Diamonds:** Only Ringo can play diamonds (high suit). This satisfies the trick structure.  

   - **If first leading suit is spades:**  
     - Players Paul (2 spades) and Ringo (1 spade) can follow.  
     - John and George cannot follow. They must play the high suit (diamonds, since other options fail).  
     - **High suit must be diamonds** to avoid conflicts in subsequent tricks.  

   - **If first leading suit is diamonds:**  
     - Players John (1 diamond) and Ringo (2 diamonds) can follow.  
     - Paul and George cannot follow.  
     - **High suit options:** Hearts or spades, but these lead to trick structure violations (e.g., multiple high suit cards).  

3. **Evaluate trick sequences for consistency:**  
   - **High suit diamonds** works for all scenarios:  
     - **First trick (hearts/spades):** Two leading suit cards, one diamond (high suit), and one other card.  
     - **Second trick (spades/club):** Leading suit avoids diamonds (high suit), allowing valid trick composition.  
     - **Third trick (remaining suits):** Follows the same logic without conflicts.  

4. **Eliminate invalid high suits:**  
   - **Hearts or spades** as high suits fail due to forced multiple high suit cards or impossible trick sequences.

He realised that he could leave 6 adjacent numbers of the face of a clock intact and rearrange the other 6 in such a way that the sum of every pair of adjacent numbers is prime.
Unfortunately the TV program started at that point so he never actually got around to doing it. Can you find the two possible solutions to Mad Ade's clock teaser?

Or
1 2 3 4 9 10 7 6 5 8 11 12",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify the Intact Block:**  
   Determine the six consecutive numbers on the clock where all adjacent sums within the block are prime. The only valid block is **11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4** (sums: 23, 13, 3, 5, 7). The connection from 4 to the next number (rearranged) must also sum to a prime.

2. **Determine Rearranged Block Constraints:**  
   The remaining numbers **5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10** must be arranged such that:  
   - **4 + first number** and **last number + 11** are primes.  
   - All adjacent pairs within the rearranged block sum to primes.  

3. **Solve for Valid Permutations:**  
   - **First number after 4** must be 7 or 9 (since \(4 + 7 = 11\) and \(4 + 9 = 13\), both primes).  
   - **Last number before 11** must be 6 or 8 (since \(6 + 11 = 17\) and \(8 + 11 = 19\), both primes).  

4. **Construct Valid Sequences:**  
   - **First Solution:** Start with 7, leading to the sequence **7, 10, 9, 8, 5, 6** (sums: 17, 19, 17, 13, 11).  
   - **Second Solution:** Start with 9, leading to the sequence **9, 10, 7, 6, 5, 8** (sums: 19, 17, 13, 11, 13).  

5. **Verify Full Arrangement:**  
   Combine the intact block with the rearranged sequences, ensuring all adjacent sums (including wrap-around) are primes.  

**Final Solutions:**  
1. **Clock Order:**  
   \(1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9, 8, 5, 6, 11, 12\)

217,"Question: You and your spouse invite four other couples to a party. During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present. Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?
 Solution: Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person. Discounting yourself, everyone knows a different number of people, which means that (again, discounting yourself) one person knows one, one person knows two, one person knows three, etc., up to one person who knows nine people (everybody else).

Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only one of those not yet paired up is person 6, so person 4 and person 6 must be married.
This leaves person 5, who knows everyone except persons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These five people, therefore, must be persons 6, 7, 8, 9, and you. Since you are the only one of these five not yet paired up, person 5 must be your spouse. So your spouse knew five people prior to the party.

 Solution: A personalised number plate.",,A personalised number plate.,DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**  
1. **Identify the Item with Variable Pricing:** The item must have a high initial cost, low replacement cost, and potential resale value. Personalized number plates (vanity plates) fit this as the registration (rights to the number) is costly, while the physical plate is cheap.  
2. **First Purchase (£5000):** Nick buys an expensive personalized number plate registration. The high cost reflects the exclusivity of the desired number.  
3. **Breaking the Item:** The physical plate is damaged, requiring a replacement. The registration (legal right to the number) remains intact.  
4. **Second Purchase (£25):** Replacing the broken physical plate costs little, as it’s just a standard replacement fee.  
5. **Resale for £6000:** The personalized number’s registration (not the physical plate) is sold at a profit, as the buyer values the unique number.  

**Logical Consistency:**  
- Personalized number plates in the UK often have high registration fees based on desirability.  
- Physical plates are inexpensive to replace.  
- The registration (legal ownership) can be resold independently, explaining the profit.

1. **Identify the letters and their constraints:**
   - Unique letters: J, A, N, E, U, Y (each assigned distinct non-zero integers).
   - Names and their sums:
     - Jane = J + A + N + E = 16
     - June = J + U + N + E = 17 (prime; all letters in June must be prime numbers).

2. **Determine primes for June:**
   - Primes ≤ 10: 2, 3, 5, 7. Their sum is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
   - Assign J, U, N, E to these primes in valid permutations.

3. **Solve for A and Y:**
   - From Jane/Jean equations: J + A + N + E = 16 → A = 16 - (J + N + E).
   - From Jenny equation: J + E + 2N + Y = 19 → Y = 19 - (J + E + 2N).

4. **Test valid prime assignments for June:**

1. **Determine the number of betting days:**
   - March 3rd (Monday) to March 31st spans 21 weekdays.

2. **Define variables for wins:**
   - Let \( K \) = number of times Kevin won.
   - Kathy won \( 2K \) times (twice as many as Kevin).
   - Kate won \( K - 1 \) times (Kevin won once more than Kate).

3. **Total wins and no-win days:**
   - Total wins: \( K + (K - 1) + 2K = 4K - 1 \).
   - Days with no winner: \( 21 - (4K - 1) = 22 - 4K \).

All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:

Her son lives with me, my 3 other sisters, my mom, and step dad.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Family Roles and Household Members:**
   - The person has **3 dads**: biological (unknown), adopted (father of the sisters), and stepdad (living in the house).
   - The **immediate family** (7 people) includes: the person, their mom, stepdad, three younger sisters, and the oldest sister’s son (nephew). 

2. **Clarify Parentage of Sisters:**
   - **Two younger sisters** share the **adopted dad** (their biological father) and the **stepdad** (living in the house), giving them **2 dads**.
   - The **oldest sister** (19, living alone) is also a sister but not part of the household. Her son (nephew) lives with the family.

3. **Resolve the Household Count:**
   - Household members: 1 (person) + 1 (mom) + 1 (stepdad) + 3 (younger sisters) + 1 (nephew) = **7 people**.
   - The **biological dad** (unknown) and **adopted dad** (sisters’ dad) are not part of the household, explaining why they aren’t counted in the 7.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The person’s **3 dads** include non-household members (biological and adopted dads) and the household stepdad.
   - The **two sisters** only have **2 dads** (adopted and stepdad), as they don’t share the biological dad unknown to them. 

**Answer:** The person’s biological dad is unknown, their stepdad lives with them, and their sisters’ adopted dad is not in the household. The oldest sister’s son (nephew) is part of the 7-member household. The two younger sisters have only the stepdad and adopted dad, not the biological dad.",True
225,"Question: There are three brothers: Al, Ben, and Carl. Two of the three brothers are boxers. Here are some facts:
1. The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.
2. The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.
3. The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.
Which brother is not a boxer?
 Solution: Carl is not a boxer.
From fact 1, we know that Carl is not the older boxer.
From fact 3, we know that Ben is not the younger boxer.
We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.
If scenario 2 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al; fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al, making Ben shorter than Carl.
If scenario 3 is true, fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al.

1. Al is the younger, taller boxer, and Ben is the older, shorter boxer.
2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.

1. **Identify Possible Boxer Pairs:** The two boxers must be among Al, Ben, and Carl. The possible pairs are (Al & Ben), (Al & Carl), and (Ben & Carl).  

2. **Analyze Fact 1 (Al & Ben):**  
   - Fact 1 states the shorter of Al and Ben is the **older boxer**.  
   - This implies:  
     - If Al is shorter, Al is the older boxer.  
     - If Ben is shorter, Ben is the older boxer.  

3. **Analyze Fact 3 (Al & Carl):**  
   - Fact 3 states the taller of Al and Carl is the **younger boxer**.  
   - This implies:  
     - If Al is taller, Al is the younger boxer.  
     - If Carl is taller, Carl is the younger boxer (but Carl cannot be a boxer in this case if eliminated).  

4. **Test Pair Al & Carl as Boxers (Case 2):**  
   - From Fact 1, the older boxer must be the shorter of Al and Ben. However, if the boxers are Al & Carl, this creates contradictions because the older boxer (Al or Carl) must be shorter than Ben, conflicting with age and height relationships. **This pair is invalid.**  

5. **Test Pair Ben & Carl as Boxers (Case 3):**  
   - Fact 1 requires Ben to be shorter than Al and the older boxer.  
   - Fact 3 requires Carl to be taller than Al and the younger boxer.  
   - Fact 2 implies the younger of Ben and Carl (Carl) must be the shorter boxer, but this contradicts Carl being taller than Al. **This pair is invalid.**  

6. **Test Pair Al & Ben as Boxers (Case 1):**  
   - **Fact 1:** Ben is shorter than Al and the older boxer.  
   - **Fact 3:** Al is taller than Carl and the younger boxer.  
   - **Fact 2:** The younger of Ben and Carl is Ben (since Carl is older), making Ben the shorter boxer.

Then the other person will say a number that is at least 1 higher than that number, and at most 10 higher.  We will keep going back and forth in this way until one of us says the number 50.  That person wins.  I'll start.""
""Not so fast!"" says Gretchen.  ""I want to win, so I will start.""
What number should Gretchen say to start?
 Solution: She wants to say, ""6.""
The series of numbers she will say is 6, 17, 28, 39, 50.
Since she wants to say 50, she needs Henry to say a number between 40 and 49.  Therefore, she wants to say 39.
Knowing she wants to say 39, she needs Henry to say a number between 29 and 38.  So she wants to say 28.  Following this same logic recursively, she will want to say 17, and she will want to say 6 to start the game, and be assured victory.","By following this strategy, she is assured a victory.

1. **Identify Winning Positions:** To win by saying 50, Gretchen must force Henry into a position where he can only say numbers between 40-49. This makes 39 a winning position, as Gretchen can then reach 50.  
2. **Backward Induction:** Subtract 11 (the sum of the minimum and maximum increments, 1+10) from each winning position to find prior safe numbers:  
   - 50 (target)  
   - 50 − 11 = 39  
   - 39 − 11 = 28  
   - 28 − 11 = 17  
   - 17 − 11 = 6  
   These are the critical numbers Gretchen must reach.  
3. **Starting Strategy:** Gretchen must begin at the earliest safe number (6). From there:  
   - Henry can say 7–16.  
   - Gretchen then adds enough (1–10) to reach 17.  
   - Repeat this logic for subsequent turns (reaching 28, 39, then 50).  
4. **Why 6?** If Gretchen starts below 6 (e.g., 5), Henry can respond by jumping to 6, disrupting her sequence. Starting at 6 ensures Gretchen maintains control.

1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?
 Solution: Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.
Fact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi. Yoshi would have had to row back to row his trip to the destination side, or else Yoshi rowed to the destination side, then back to the start, then got rowed across by Xavier.",,"Yoshi rowed twice.

1. **Determine Total Rowing Instances:**  
   There are 3 forward trips (each requiring one rower) and 2 return trips (each requiring one rower), totaling 5 rowing instances. With 4 people each rowing at least once, one person must row twice.

2. **Analyze Walter’s Constraints:**  
   Walter can only row alone (return trips). Since he starts on the starting side, he must first reach the destination as a passenger. Thus, Walter must row at least one return trip, but cannot row any forward trip.

3. **Track Possible Rowers for Return Trips:**  
   Return trips are from the destination side. After the first forward trip, only Xavier and Yoshi are on the destination side. One of them must row the first return trip. Walter can only row a return trip after reaching the destination as a passenger.

4. **Construct a Valid Sequence:**  
   - **Forward 1:** Xavier rows with Yoshi (satisfies Xavier’s requirement to have Yoshi as a passenger).  
   - **Return 1:** Yoshi rows back (now Yoshi is on the starting side).  
   - **Forward 2:** Yoshi rows with Walter (taking Walter to the destination).  
   - **Return 2:** Walter rows back alone (fulfilling his rowing requirement).  
   - **Forward 3:** Zeke rows with Walter (ensuring Zeke rows once).  

5. **Verify Compliance with All Rules:**  
   - Xavier rows once (Forward 1).  
   - Yoshi rows twice (Forward 2 and Return 1).  
   - Zeke rows once (Forward 3).  
   - Walter rows once (Return 2).  
   All constraints are satisfied: each person rows at least once, and Yoshi rows twice without violating any rules.

The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire.

How could he do it without triggering the alarm?
 Solution: Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies. With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",,"Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half.

Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Alarm Constraints:**  
   The alarm wires are spaced 8 cm apart and trigger if any wire experiences over 4 kg (≈39.2 N) of force. Carlo’s weight (74 kg ≈725.2 N) must be distributed to avoid exceeding this limit per wire.

2. **Maximize Weight Distribution:**  
   Carlo uses the 5-meter board, cutting it into two 2.5-meter lengths with the saw. These act as “skis” to spread his weight over multiple wires. Each 2.5-meter board spans ~31 wires (250 cm / 8 cm ≈31.25 wires per board).

3. **Calculate Force per Wire:**  
   With two skis, his weight is distributed across ~62 wires. Total force per wire:  
   \( \frac{725.2\ \text{N}}{62} \approx 11.7\ \text{N/wire} \) (well below 39.2 N limit).

4. **Secure the Skis:**  
   The four leather straps fasten the skis to his feet, ensuring even weight distribution as he walks.

5. **Execute the Theft:**  
   Carlo walks slowly on the skis to the center, avoiding concentrated pressure. He uses the hammer to break the glass cube, retrieves the diamond, and exits the same way.

**Logical Steps:**  
- **Step 1:** Cut the 5m board into two 2.5m skis.  
- **Step 2:** Attach skis to feet with straps, distributing weight over ~62 wires.  
- **Step 3:** Walk carefully to the pedestal, ensuring skis remain flat to maintain distribution.  
- **Step 4:** Break the glass, take the diamond, and retreat without concentrating weight on any wire.  

**Conclusion:** The skis reduce force per wire below the 4 kg threshold, allowing Carlo to steal the diamond undetected.",True
232,"Question: One day, in baking class, 15 students were baking cakes when the fire alarm went off. Everyone exited the building, but when they got back, they found someone had dumped all the sugar into two of the batter-filled bowls. Everyone was puzzled over what to do until Alice had an idea: why not mix the batters together and then separate the contents back in the bowls. Here is what happened in chronological order:
Alice mixed with Flare
June pours some into Emma's
Luke mixed with Callie
June mixed with Gabbi
Flare mixed with Gabbi
Watt mixed with Tina
Flare mixed with Tina
Luke mixed with Flare
Gabbi mixed with Callie
Daniel, Emma, & Alice mixed with each other
Oscar mixed with Quinn
Misty mixed with Callie
Alice, Misty, & Oscar mixed with each other
Tina mixed with Emma
Kaleb mixed with Quinn
June mixed with Daniel
Luke mixed with June
Ryan, Luke, & Watt mixed with each other
Callie, Alice, & Flare mixed with each other
Kaleb pours some into Daniel's
Watt mixed with Ryan
Watt pours some into Kaleb's
Daniel mixed with Luke
Misty mixed with Gabbi
Kaleb mixed with Tina
Emma & Quinn had no sugar; which 2 bowls started with sugar?
Everyone was able to figure it out.
 Solution: Luke & Callie
To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.
However, it can't be Ryan and Misty because they can't give June sugar!",Everyone was able to figure it out.,"Luke & Callie

1. **Eliminate Direct Connections to Emma and Quinn:**
   - Emma and Quinn ended with no sugar, so any bowl that mixed with them or their intermediaries (who could transfer sugar) cannot be the original two.
   - **Eliminated:** Emma, Quinn, June (poured into Emma), Daniel/Alice (mixed with Emma), Tina (mixed with Emma), Oscar/Kaleb (mixed with Quinn).

2. **Identify Remaining Candidates:**
   - After eliminations, possible originals: **Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, Ryan**.

3. **Remove Indirect Risks to Emma/Quinn:**
   - **Flare:** Mixed with Alice (step1), who later mixed with Emma. Eliminate Flare.
   - **Watt:** Mixed with Tina (step6), who later mixed with Emma. Eliminate Watt.
   - **Gabbi:** Mixed with Flare (step5), who connects to Alice/Emma. Eliminate Gabbi.

4. **Final Candidates:**
   - Remaining: **Luke, Callie, Misty, Ryan**.

5. **Determine Logical Original Pair:**
   - **Misty & Ryan** are invalid: No pathway for them to influence others without eventually connecting to Emma/Quinn (e.g., Misty mixing with Alice/Oscar, who could link to Emma). 
   - **Luke & Callie** are valid: Their early mixing (step3) and subsequent interactions (e.g., with Flare, Gabbi) do **not** create a chain to Emma/Quinn when accounting for chronological order. Steps involving Emma/Quinn (like June pouring into Emma) occur **before** sugar could reach them via later mixes.

**ANSWER:** The two bowls that started with sugar are **Luke & Callie**.",True

Use the clues below to put the lands in order (1st,2nd,3rd, and 4th), figure out which castle belongs in which land, which creature belong to which castle, and help Beethoven reclaim his wig!
Object: Beethoven's Wig
Fantasylands: Lothlorien, Mordor, Narnia, and Malacandra.
Creatures: Dragon, Troll, Giant, and Balrog.
Castles: Stone, Gold, Glass, and Silver.
1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
4.  The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
5.  The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
6.  Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
7.  The Troll is not at the Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.
 Solution: Mordor is the first fantasyland.  It contains the Giant and the Silver Castle.

Lothlorien is the fourth land.  It contains the Troll and the Glass Castle.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify Positions Based on Clue 6**:
   - Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who is in position 2. Thus:
     - **1st**: Mordor
     - **2nd**: Dragon (Narnia, since Dragon must be in a land).

2. **Place Balrog and Stone Castle (Clues 1, 4)**:
   - Balrog is at Stone Castle (Clue 4) and not in Lothlorien. Stone Castle is in Malacandra or Lothlorien (Clue 2). Since Balrog isn’t in Lothlorien, Stone Castle must be in Malacandra.
   - From Clue 1, Lothlorien is to the right of Balrog (Malacandra), so:
     - **3rd**: Malacandra (Stone Castle, Balrog)
     - **4th**: Lothlorien.

3. **Determine Castle Order (Clue 5, 7)**:
   - Golden Castle is left of Balrog (position 3) and right of Silver Castle (Clue 5). Silver Castle must be in position 1 (Mordor), and Golden in 2 (Narnia).
   - From Clue 7, Silver Castle (position 1) is 1 place left of the Wig, so the Wig is in position 2 (Narnia).

4. **Assign Creatures**:
   - Dragon is in Narnia (position 2). Balrog is in Malacandra (position 3).
   - Giant can’t be in Lothlorien or with the Wig (Clue 3), so Giant is in Mordor (position 1). Troll remains in Lothlorien (position 4).

235,"Question: Just before the end of the term four high school students were discussing their chances for certain grades. The following remarks contain the gist of their hopes and fears.
Jack: We'll all get different grades. If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D.
Jean: If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D. Jack will get a better grade than Paul.
Lucy: If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C. If I get a B, then Paul won't get a D.
Paul: If Lucy gets an A, then I'll get a B. if Jean doesn't get a B, I won't either.
When the final examinations were graded and the term marks made out each of the four passed, and strange as it may seem, each received a grade that checked exactly with all the ideas they had previously expressed.
What grade did each receive?
 Solution: Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul received B, A, D, and C, respectively.",,"Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul received B, A, D, and C, respectively.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Determine Possible Grades for Lucy:**
   - From Jean's first statement, if Lucy=C leads to a contradiction (Jack=D and Jack > Paul impossible), so Lucy ≠ C.
   - From Paul's statements, Lucy=A leads to a contradiction (Paul=B and Jean=B impossible), so Lucy ≠ A.
   - Therefore, Lucy must be B or D.

2. **Evaluate Lucy=B Scenario:**
   - If Lucy=B, Paul≠D (from Lucy's second statement). Paul can only be A/C, but Paul=A forces Jack > A (impossible). Thus, Paul=C, requiring Jack=A. But Jack=A implies Lucy=D (contradicts Lucy=B). Thus, Lucy≠B.
   - Therefore, **Lucy=D**.

3. **Analyze Remaining Grades (A, B, C):**
   - Paul cannot be B (from Paul's second statement). Remaining grades: Jack, Jean, Paul must have A, B, C with Jean and Paul constraints.

4. **Assign Jean=A:**
   - If Jean=A:
     - Jack and Paul must be B and C.
     - Jean's second statement (Jack > Paul) requires Jack=B and Paul=C.
   - Verify all statements:
     - **Jack=B**: Satisfies ""If Jack=A → Lucy=D"" (irrelevant since Jack≠A).
     - **Jean=A**: Satisfies Lucy's first statement (no action needed).
     - **Paul=C**: Satisfies Paul's statements (no conflicts).
     - All grades distinct (A, B, C, D).

5. **Confirm No Other Valid Assignments:**
   - If Jean≠A, Lucy's first statement forces Jack=C. Jean's second statement (Jack > Paul) fails as Paul cannot be lower than C. Hence, Jean must be A.

**FINAL GRADES:**
- **Jack: B**
- **Jean: A**
- **Lucy: D**
- **Paul: C**",True

Imagine the chessboard is set out with reference points 1 to 8 on the vertical and A to H across the horizontal.
At what positions would the five Queens need to be?
 Solution: A5, D5, E5, F5, H1",,"A5, D5, E5, F5, H1",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Understand the Queen's Movement**: A Queen attacks all squares in her row, column, and diagonals. The goal is to place 5 Queens such that every square on the board (including those with Queens) is under attack by at least one Queen.

2. **Strategic Placement of Queens**:
   - **Row 5 (A5, D5, E5, F5)**: Four Queens are placed in row 5, spaced to cover overlapping diagonals and columns. This ensures:
     - **Full Coverage of Row 5**: All squares in row 5 are attacked by the Queens in that row.
     - **Diagonal Coverage**: Their diagonals cover upper and lower rows (e.g., A5 covers diagonals to B6/C7/D8 and B4/C3/D2/E1; D5/E5/F5 cover central diagonals).
   - **H1 (Corner Queen)**: The fifth Queen at H1 covers:
     - **Column H**: All squares from H1 to H8.
     - **Row 1**: All squares in row 1 (A1–H1).
     - **Diagonals**: From H1, diagonals extend to G2/F3/E4/D5/C6/B7/A8, covering key central squares.

3. **Verification of Coverage**:
   - **Columns A–G**: Columns without Queens (B, C, G) are covered by diagonals from Queens in row 5 and H1.
   - **Rows 1–8**:
     - Rows 1 and 5 are directly covered by Queens.
     - Rows 2–4 and 6–8 are covered by vertical/diagonal attacks from Queens in row 5 and H1.
   - **Diagonals**: Overlapping diagonals from the five Queens ensure no square is left unattacked.

4. **Self-Attack Check**: Each Queen’s square is under attack:
   - Queens in row 5 attack each other’s squares via their shared row.
   - The H1 Queen’s square is under attack by herself (as the problem allows a Queen to count her own square as attacked).

**Final Positions**: A5, D5, E5, F5 (row 5, spaced for diagonal coverage) and H1 (covers column H, row 1, and critical diagonals). This configuration minimizes Queens to 5 while ensuring all 64 squares are attacked.",True

1. **Analyze Equation 4 (a * a = b):**
   - Since a, b must be distinct values from {0, 1, 2}, test possible a values:

239,"Question: You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!
 Solution: The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:
71-19-17-68",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

1. **Clue 2 Restrictions**: Only digits 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9 are allowed (no 2-5), and no leading zeros.  
2. **Clue 3 & 1**: The third set (reversed first set) multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set. Testing valid two-digit numbers:  
   - Only **17** (4×17=68) and **19** (4×19=76) work, but 76 contains 7 and 6 (valid). However, **clue 1** requires the third set to match the reversed first set.  
3. **Clue 5**: The second set is ≤20, so it starts with **1** (e.g., 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19).  
4. **Clue 4**: First digit of first set + first digit of second set = 8. Since the second set starts with 1, the first set starts with **7**.  
5. **Clue 1**: First set = 7X, third set = X7. From step 2, valid third sets are **17** or **19**, but **19 reversed is 91**, which is invalid (no 9 in first set). Thus, third set = **17**, so first set = **71**.  
6. **Clue 3**: Fourth set = 17×4 = **68**.  
7. **Clue 6**: Second digit of second set (X) × second digit of fourth set (8) = 71 + 1 = 72 → X = 9. Second set = **19**.

241,"Question: In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?
 Solution: Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.

1. **Determine Hosting Teams:**
   - Los Angeles Dodgers hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 (as the first two and last two games).
   - New York Yankees hosted Games 3, 4, and 5.

2. **Series Length Implies Split Wins:**
   - The Series lasted 7 games, meaning both teams won 3 games each in the first 6 games. Game 7 decides the champion.

3. **Game 7 Location and Home Team Rules:**
   - Game 7 was in Los Angeles (home team bats last).
   - In extra innings, the visiting team bats first (top of the inning), and the home team bats second (bottom of the inning).

4. **Analyze Game 7 Score (13-8, 13 Innings):**
   - The final margin is 5 runs (13 - 8 = 5).
   - **Key Rule:** A home team cannot win by >4 runs in an extra-inning game. If the home team takes the lead in the bottom of the inning, the game ends immediately. The maximum margin via a walk-off grand slam is 4 runs.

5. **Deduce the Inning Progression:**
   - Since the Dodgers (home) could not win by 5 runs in the bottom of the 13th, the Yankees must have scored 5 runs in the top of the 13th (making it 13-8). The Dodgers then failed to score in the bottom half, ending the game.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The Yankees won Game 7 (13-8), securing their 4th win.

242,"Question: A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.
 Solution: The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.

1. **Establish Variables and Basic Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the larger group (water mill) and \( y \) the smaller group (beach).  
   - \( x + y = 86 \), with \( x > y \).

2. **Apply Condition (a):**  
   - \( \frac{1}{4}x > y \). Substituting \( y = 86 - x \), solve:  
     \( \frac{x}{4} > 86 - x \rightarrow x > 68.8 \).  
   - \( x \geq 69 \), \( y \leq 17 \).

3. **Condition (d): One Group Divisible by 4:**  
   - Possible pairs \((x, y)\) must include a multiple of 4. Test even numbers (since \( x + y = 86 \) is even, both \( x \) and \( y \) must be even).  
   - Valid pairs: \((70, 16), (72, 14), ..., (84, 2)\).

4. **Condition (e): One Group a Multiple of 9:**  
   - For a group to have \( 8 \times \) more people under 50, its size must be \( 9k \).  
   - Check multiples of 9 in possible \( x \): \( 72 \) (since \( y \leq 17 \), no valid \( y \) is a multiple of 9).  
   - Thus, \( x = 72 \), \( y = 14 \).

5. **Verify All Conditions:**  
   - **(a)** \( \frac{72}{4} = 18 > 14 \). ✔️  
   - **(b)** \( y = 14 \): \( 12 \) women (\( 6 \times 2 \) men). ✔️  
   - **(c)** Both groups even; \( y = 14 \) can be \( 7 \) couples. ✔️  
   - **(d)** \( 72 \) is divisible by 4. ✔️  
   - **(e)** \( 72 = 9 \times 8 \): \( 8 \) people \( \geq 50 \), \( 64 < 50 \). ✔️

   - **Mad Ade (MA)** must be present to prevent **Daft Derrick (DD)** from eating **Kebabrie (K)**.
   - **Daft Derrick (DD)** must be present to prevent **Mad Ade (MA)** from eating **Chillirella (C)**.
   - **Sue Denim (SD)** must be present to prevent **Beef Curry (BC)** from eating cheese or biting others.

2. **Prioritize Managing Beef Curry:**
   - **SD** must always accompany **BC** or ensure it’s left alone to avoid incidents. This necessitates **SD** shuttling **BC** repeatedly.

3. **Transport Cheeses Strategically:**
   - **Kebabrie** and **Chillirella** are moved one at a time. **SD** initially transports **Kebabrie** while toggling **BC**’s location to comply with constraints.

4. **Move Mad Ade and Daft Derrick Safely:**
   - **MA** and **DD** are transported in pairs or with **SD/BC** to avoid leaving them alone with forbidden cheeses. For example:
     - **MA** takes **Kebabrie** to the show, returns alone.
     - **DD** and **MA** travel together to ensure mutual oversight.

5. **Finalize Chillirella Transport:**
   - After securing **Kebabrie**, **SD** focuses on **Chillirella**, again using **BC** toggling to maintain safety.

6. **Total Trips Calculation:**
   - Each cheese and person movement requires careful back-and-forth trips (e.g., 17 steps as per constraints). The minimal sequence ensures no constraint violations, leveraging **SD**’s role in controlling **BC** and coordinating transfers.

247,"Question: You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?
 Solution: 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9

So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Determine the 5th Digit:**
   - The sum of the first 5 digits is 19, and the sum of the last 5 digits is 27. 
   - Total sum of digits 1-9 is 45. The overlap (5th digit) is counted twice, so \( 19 + 27 - 45 = 1 \). **Position 5 = 1**.

2. **Fix Positions for 2, 4, 6, 8:**
   - **Positions 2 and 4** must be 2 and 4 (order unknown).
   - **Positions 6 and 8** must be 6 and 8 (order unknown).

3. **Sum Constraints for Remaining Digits:**
   - First 4 digits (positions 1-4) sum to \( 19 - 1 = 18 \). Positions 2 and 4 sum to 6, so positions 1 and 3 must sum to \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - Last 4 digits (positions 6-9) sum to \( 27 - 1 = 26 \). Positions 6 and 8 sum to 14, so positions 7 and 9 must sum to \( 26 - 14 = 12 \).
   - Remaining digits: 3, 5, 7, 9. These must split into two pairs summing to 12 each: \( (3, 9) \) and \( (5, 7) \).

4. **Assign Positions 1, 3, 7, 9:**
   - **No consecutive digits** constraint eliminates invalid placements:
     - If **position 2 = 2** and **position 4 = 4**:
       - Position 1 cannot be 3 (adjacent to 2), leaving 5, 7, 9.
       - Position 1 = 5, Position 3 = 7 (sum 12). Validate:
         - Adjacent pairs: 5-2, 2-7, 7-4 (non-consecutive).
       - Positions 7 and 9: Assign 3 and 9. To avoid adjacency:
         - Position 6 = 8, Position 8 = 6 (non-consecutive with 3 and 9).

5. **Final Sequence:**
   - **Sequence**: 5 (1st), 2 (2nd), 7 (3rd), 4 (4th), 1 (5th), 8 (6th), 3 (7th), 6 (8th), 9 (9th).
   - **Verify all constraints**:
     - All digits 1-9 used once.
     - No consecutive digits are adjacent.
     - 2/4 in positions 2/4, 6/8 in positions 6/8.
     - Sums: First 5 = 19, Last 5 = 27.

248,"Question: In a mathematics contest, A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H got the top eight places. The teacher asked them to guess who got first.
A said: ""Either F or H is first.""
B said: ""I'm first.""
C said: ""G is first.""
D said: ""B is not first.""
E said: ""A is wrong.""
F said: ""Neither I nor H is the first.""
G said: ""C is not first.""
H said: ""I agree with A.""
The teacher told them that exactly three of them guessed correctly. Then, who got first?
 Solution: Since B and D contradict each other, exactly one of them must be true.
Since A and H agree with each other while E and F are against them, exactly two of these four must be true.
Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.","It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might be better methods.","Since B and D contradict each other, exactly one of them must be true.
Since A and H agree with each other while E and F are against them, exactly two of these four must be true.
Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.",DSReason,solutionSummary,"**SUMMARY:**

1. **Identify Contradictory Statements:**
   - **B** (""I'm first"") and **D** (""B is not first"") contradict; exactly one is true.
   - **A** (""F or H is first"") and **H** (agrees with A) must align (both true/false).
   - **E** (""A is wrong"") and **F** (""Neither I nor H is first"") contradict **A** and **H**.

2. **Analyze Truth Distribution:**
   - **A/H** and **E/F** form two groups where **two statements total** are true (either A+H or E+F).
   - The third truth must come from **B/D**, leaving **C** and **G** as false.

3. **Resolve C and G:**
   - **C** claims ""G is first""; **G** claims ""C is not first.""
   - If **C** is false, G is not first. If **G** is false, C *is* first.
   - Since **both C and G must be wrong**, this implies **C is first** (making G's statement false).

4. **Verify Consistency:**
   - If **C is first**:
     - **A/H** are false (first is not F/H), **E/F** are true (A is wrong, F/H aren't first).
     - **D** is true (""B is not first""), **B** is false.
     - Total truths: **E, F, D** (3 correct), matching the problem's constraints.

249,"Question: Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?
1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this
order): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark
chocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.
2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one
from milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.
3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.
4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.
5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.
6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.
7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped
chocolate is #1.

1. **Assign Position 1 (Triangular):**  
   - Clue 7 states the triangular chocolate is #1. Assign flavor as Dark Chocolate (each row must have one dark and milk, not adjacent).

2. **Determine Row 1's Milk Chocolate:**  
   - Row 1 must include one milk chocolate. Position 4 is assigned Oval-shaped Milk Chocolate (later linked to Clue 7).

3. **Clue 3 (Cremino, Heart, Trapezoid):**  
   - Cremino (flavor) is left of Heart-shaped (Milk-Cognac) in the same row (Row 2, positions 7 and 8). Trapezoid (position 11) is directly below Cremino.

4. **Clue 1's Row (Row 2):**  
   - Row 2 contains Flower-shaped (White-Hazelnut, not Gianduia), Dark-Orange (Rhombus), Heart (Milk-Cognac), and the chocolate below White (position 7, Cremino). White in Row 1 (position 3: Rectangular).

5. **Clue 4 (Hexagonal & Dark-Hazelnut):**
