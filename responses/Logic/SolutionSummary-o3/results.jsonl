{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm\" said the wrestler.\nThe swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

{"ID": 4, "Question": "Question: Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Solution: 199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way.

Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.

No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?\n Solution: First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja.

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.

Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10.

{"ID": 17, "Question": "Question: Johnny was given 16 coins by his older, somewhat meaner brother, Mark.  He told him that he could keep them all if he could place all 16 on the table in such a way that they formed 15 rows with 4 coins in each row.\nAfter 10 minutes, Johnny walked away with the coins and Mark, after complaining futilely to his mother, left with nothing.\nHow did Johnny place the coins?\n Solution: If you draw a 5-pointed star with all sides of equal length, you will create a pentagon in the middle with all 5 sides of equal length.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Solution: Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "Question: The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, \"white\" can mean \"my mother did my laundry\" and \"black\" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.\n Solution: Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer \"white\" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it.

Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people.

This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\".

{"ID": 23, "Question": "Question: \"Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!\"  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.\n\"Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.\"  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.\nNora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  \"You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?\"\n\"Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.\"\n\"Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.\"\n\"It runs in the family,\" he smiled across two time zones.  \"Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ...\" Vic's voice trailed off.\n\"Except for one interval?\"  Corman filled in.\n\"Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.\"\nNora yelped.  \"You had *eleven*,\" then her left brain caught up, \"no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.\"\n\"De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.\"\n\"So they got it sorted out?\"\n\"Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!\"\n\"So what did they do?\"\n\"Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.\"\nHe took a cleansing breath.  \"On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?\"\n\"I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?\"\nVic broke in, \"He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.\"\nCorman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  \"Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?\"\n\"Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.\"\n\"Got it.\"  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.

{"ID": 32, "Question": "Question: These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.\nFrom the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?\n1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.\n2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.\n3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.\n4.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1).

Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate.

The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won.

Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:\n\"I see a person with blue eyes.\"\nWho leaves the island? And when do they leave?\n Solution: All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island.

So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

Here's how to do it:\nFirst drop the first ball from the 14th floor.

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8).

Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.\nAnne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11).

{"ID": 41, "Question": "Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)\n Solution: It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Hint": "The number of days depends on the number of red hats.", "Human Solution": "It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf.

{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm\" said the wrestler.\nThe swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

Then he'll be led back to his cell.\"\n\"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing.

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Solution: 199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.

So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?\n Solution: First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.", "Hint": "Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?", "Human Solution": "First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question.

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Solution: 199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:\nK J Q T A\nC D S H C\nTherefore there are two CLUBS.", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?\n Solution: First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False.

If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)\n17th is 8 or 24.\nOn the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)\n17th is 24 and Cutbank.\nMad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).\nWith one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)\nHe fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.\nHumpback is 21st. (2)\nMad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)\nHumpback is Big Little Falls.\nThe deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)\nFirst day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.\n15th then is Bottle.\nMad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).\nMouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.\nDolly is 14th or 15th.\nMad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)\nMayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.\nStonefly is 15th.\nMad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.\nAt least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)\nStonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.\nMad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)\nOnly wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nElk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.\nParachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.\nHis shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nBrookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.\nThe fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)\nAdams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nSo, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.\n Solution: From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Solution: Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "Question: The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, \"white\" can mean \"my mother did my laundry\" and \"black\" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.\n Solution: Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer \"white\" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1.

Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people.

{"ID": 23, "Question": "Question: \"Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!\"  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.\n\"Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.\"  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.\nNora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  \"You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?\"\n\"Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.\"\n\"Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.\"\n\"It runs in the family,\" he smiled across two time zones.  \"Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ...\" Vic's voice trailed off.\n\"Except for one interval?\"  Corman filled in.\n\"Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.\"\nNora yelped.  \"You had *eleven*,\" then her left brain caught up, \"no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.\"\n\"De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.\"\n\"So they got it sorted out?\"\n\"Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!\"\n\"So what did they do?\"\n\"Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.\"\nHe took a cleansing breath.  \"On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?\"\n\"I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?\"\nVic broke in, \"He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.\"\nCorman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  \"Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?\"\n\"Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.\"\n\"Got it.\"  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.

{"ID": 32, "Question": "Question: These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.\nFrom the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?\n1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.\n2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.\n3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.\n4.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate.

{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.

Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.

But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.\n\"In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.\n\"After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.\"\n\"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random.

The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.\n3.

Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.\n3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": null, "Status": false}

{"ID": 4, "Question": "Question: Typical \"stars\" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Solution: 199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.

No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?\n Solution: First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)\n17th is 8 or 24.\nOn the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)\n17th is 24 and Cutbank.\nMad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).\nWith one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)\nHe fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.\nHumpback is 21st. (2)\nMad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)\nHumpback is Big Little Falls.\nThe deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)\nFirst day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.\n15th then is Bottle.\nMad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).\nMouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.\nDolly is 14th or 15th.\nMad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)\nMayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.\nStonefly is 15th.\nMad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.\nAt least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)\nStonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.\nMad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)\nOnly wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nElk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.\nParachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.\nHis shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nBrookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.\nThe fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)\nAdams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)\nSo, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.\nSo 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.\n21st is 17 inches, only odd left.\nDeep Channel is 22 inches.\nThe fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).\nLittle Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.\nAlthough they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)\nSo, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.\nSummary:\n14th, Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16, Little Curl\n15th, Stonefly Nymph, Cutthroat, 19, Bottle Well\n17th, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, Monkey Trout, 24, Old Cutbank\n18th, Mayfly, Brookside Trout, 8, Dish Creek\n19th, Yuk Bug, Lake Trout, 27, Big Rock Isle\n20th, Parachute Adams, Rainbow, 22, Deep Channel\n21st, Humpy, Humpback Trout, 17, Big Little Falls", "Hint": "Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.

{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.

Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.
