0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Complete strategy (agreed upon during the one meeting)

0.  Vocabulary  
   – We call one prisoner the COUNTER.  
   – All the other 22 prisoners are ORDINARY prisoners.  
   – Switch A will be the “signal” switch.  
   – Switch B will be the “waste” switch (used only so that everybody always flips
     some switch, as the warden requires).  
   – Everybody knows that at the start both switches are OFF.

1.  What an ORDINARY prisoner does on each visit  

   a)  If he has never signalled before AND he finds switch A = OFF,  
       • he flips switch A to ON (this is his one and only signal),  
       • from now on he remembers that he has already signalled.  
   b)  In every other circumstance (he has already signalled, or A is
       already ON when he enters) he flips switch B instead
       (from OFF→ON or ON→OFF; it does not matter which way).

   Thus an ordinary prisoner changes A from OFF to ON at most once in his life;
   afterwards he will never touch A again.

2.  What the COUNTER does on each visit  

   a)  If he finds switch A = ON he flips A back to OFF and
       increases his private count by 1.  
   b)  If he finds switch A = OFF he flips switch B (again direction is irrelevant).

3.  When the COUNTER’s private count reaches 22 he immediately
   announces “All of us have visited the switch room.”

Why the strategy works

•  Safety (no premature announcement).  
   – Only the 22 ordinary prisoners are permitted to put A into the state OFF→ON.  
   – Each of them does this at most once.  
   – Therefore the COUNTER can increase his count at most 22 times, so he
     cannot reach 22 until every ordinary prisoner has signalled.  
   – Hence an announcement can never be false.

•  Liveness (the announcement will eventually be made).  
   – The warden’s rules guarantee that every prisoner is taken to the room
     infinitely often, so:  
       • The COUNTER returns infinitely many times and therefore resets A to OFF
         infinitely many times.  
       • Each ordinary prisoner is eventually taken to the room at a moment when
         A is OFF and he has not yet signalled, so he will perform his one
         OFF→ON signal sooner or later.  
   – Consequently the COUNTER’s count will eventually reach 22, and he will
     announce at some finite time.

•  Requirement of moving exactly one switch every visit is met because everyone
  always flips either A or B.

Thus the prisoners have a strategy that is perfectly safe and guaranteed to
succeed.

Final answer: Designate one prisoner as the COUNTER; let every other prisoner flip switch A from OFF to ON exactly once (their first opportunity with A = OFF) and thereafter always flip switch B, while the COUNTER turns A from ON back to OFF and counts; when his count reaches 22 he announces that all 23 prisoners have visited, which is both correct and inevitable.",True

Proceed systematically.

1.  Rule 3 has a tight form:  
    – If we take C = F × 3, the only possibilities in 0–9 are  
      (C,F) = (3,1), (6,2), (9,3).  
      Keep this in mind.

2.  Use C = F × 3 with the first pair (C,F) = (3,1).  
    Now Rule 10 can use J = C × 2 (which gives J = 6) or J = H – 2.  
    Taking J = C × 2 makes J=6 clash soon with other rules, so pick the
    alternative path:
      – Keep J undetermined and set J = H – 2 later.

3.  Rule 8 has H = C × 3 or H = A/2.  
    With C = 3, H = C × 3 gives H = 9 neatly, leaving A/2 unused.

4.  Now Rule 10 becomes J = H – 2 = 9 – 2 = 7.  
    So far we have
        C=3, F=1, H=9, J=7.

5.  Rule 7: G = F + 1 or G = I – 3.  
    Choosing G = F + 1 gives G = 2.

6.  Rule 4: D = G × 4 or D = E / 3.  
    With G = 2 we may use D = G × 4 = 8, which fixes D.

7.  Rule 5: E = J – 1 or E = D / 4.  
    J – 1 = 6 works and does not clash with present digits, so set E = 6.

8.  Rule 6: F = B × 2 or F = A – 4.  
    Since F = 1 cannot equal B × 2 (B would be 0.5), use F = A – 4 → A = 5.

9.  Rule 1: A = B / 3 or A = G + 3.  
    G + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5, matching A, so this rule is satisfied; B need not be fixed here.

10. Rule 2 now links B, I, E: either B = I – 4 or B = E + 4.  
    Because E = 6 makes E + 4 = 10 impossible, we need B = I – 4.

11. Digits left unused are 0 and 4.  
    Take (I, B) = (4, 0) to satisfy B = I – 4.

12. Rule 7’s second option (G = I – 3) is 2 = 4 – 3? No; but Rule 7
    is already satisfied by G = F + 1, so that’s fine.

13. Rule 9: I = H + 3 or I = D / 2.  
    D / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 equals I, so Rule 9 holds.

Every rule is now satisfied with distinct digits:

A = 5, B = 0, C = 3, D = 8, E = 6,  
F = 1, G = 2, H = 9, I = 4, J = 7.

Final answer: 5038612947",True
4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the 1000 vertices be numbered 0,1,2,…,999 around a circle.  

Choose a fixed “step” k (1 ≤ k ≤ 999) and draw successive segments  

0→k→2k→3k→… (mod 1000)

until we return to 0.  
The resulting figure is a single continuous polygonal path exactly when every vertex is visited once before returning to 0; this happens iff gcd(1000,k)=1.  
(The path then has length 1000.)

1. Number of coprime steps  
   φ(1000) counts the integers 1≤k≤999 that are coprime to 1000.  
   1000 = 2³·5³ ⇒  
   φ(1000)=1000·(1−1/2)·(1−1/5)=1000·½·⅘=400.

2. Disregarding the ordinary polygon  
   k=1 (and its reverse step k=999) gives the regular 1000-gon, not a “star”, so eliminate this pair.

3. Identifying a star with its reverse direction  
   Steps k and 1000−k trace the same star in opposite directions, so each star corresponds to a pair {k,1000−k}.  
   Because φ(1000) is even (400), the 400 coprime steps form 200 such pairs.

4. Count of distinct stars  
   Total pairs  = 200  
   Minus the single pair {1,999} = 199 stars.

Hence there are 199 different ways to draw a 1000-point star.

Final answer: 199",True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

• vegetables = {Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, Broccoli}  
• rows = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (all different)  
• days = {25, 27, 28, 29, 30 May} (Sunday 26 May is excluded)  
• places = {North, South, East, West, North-West (NW)} (all different)  

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  East side was planted “on one week’s last day” ⇒ East-day = Sat 25 May.  

2.  South side has exactly 3 rows.  

3.  Peppers’ day is 3 days after Radishes’ day.  
    With the available dates this can only be 25→28 or 27→30.

4.  Broccoli is NOT on 29 May and NOT in the West side.  
    West-day is exactly one day before Broccoli-day.

5.  Radish rows > Broccoli rows and < Tomato rows;  
    Peppers rows > Broccoli rows.

6.  NW corner is NOT Peppers and NOT Tomatoes and its rows are even (2 or 4).

7.  Order of row-counts in time: 4-rows first, then 3-rows, then 2-rows.

8.  Lettuce rows <3, and Lettuce-day is one day after South-day.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Try Radishes on 25 May (the only crop already located – East).  
Then Peppers must be on 28 May (rule 3).

Since West-day is immediately before Broccoli-day and Broccoli is not on 29 May,  
West-day cannot be 28; the only feasible pair is West 29 May → Broccoli 30 May.

So far we have
25 May  – Radishes – East  
28 May  – Peppers  
29 May  – (West, unknown veg)  
30 May  – Broccoli  
27 May  – (remaining veg)

Because West is 29 May and Broccoli is 30 May, rule 4 is satisfied.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Assigning rows to fit all numerical rules:

• Put the earliest (25 May) crop at 4 rows (rule 7) ⇒ Radishes = 4 rows.  
• South side must be 3 rows (rule 2); Peppers rows must exceed Broccoli rows, so let Peppers be the South crop ⇒ Peppers = 3 rows, South.  
  (This also places the 3-row crop after the 4-row crop, still fitting rule 7.)

• Lettuce must be one day after South (rule 8) ⇒ Lettuce-day = 29 May;  
  West side is already 29 May, so Lettuce is the West crop.  
  Lettuce rows <3, choose the unused smallest value ⇒ Lettuce = 1 row.  
  (Row-order 4 rows (25 May) → 3 rows (28 May) → 2 rows(?) still to come → fits rule 7.)

• NW corner must have an even number of rows (rule 6) and is not Peppers/Tomatoes.  
  The only crop left for 30 May is Broccoli, so put Broccoli in the NW corner with 2 rows.  

• The remaining unassigned vegetable is Tomatoes; the remaining day is 27 May and the remaining place is North.  
  Tomatoes must beat Radishes in rows, so Tomatoes = 5 rows.

------------------------------------------------------------------
All conditions now check:

• Peppers day 28 is 3 days after Radishes day 25 ✔  
• Radishes 4 > Broccoli 2 and < Tomatoes 5 ✔  
• West (Lettuce) 29 is one day before Broccoli 30 ✔  
• Tomatoes not in East (they are in North) ✔  
• South side is Peppers with 3 perfect rows ✔  
• East side (Radishes) planted 25 May, the week’s last day ✔  
• NW corner (Broccoli) has an even row-count, and is not Peppers/Tomatoes ✔  
• Row-order in time: 4 (25 May) → 3 (28 May) → 2 (30 May) ✔  
• Lettuce rows <3 (it has 1), and South (28 May) one day before Lettuce (29 May) ✔  
• Peppers rows (3) > Broccoli rows (2); Broccoli not West and not on 29 May ✔  

------------------------------------------------------------------
Final answer:
Tomatoes – 5 rows – 27 May – North  
Peppers  – 3 rows – 28 May – South  
Radishes – 4 rows – 25 May – East  
Lettuce  – 1 row  – 29 May – West  
Broccoli – 2 rows – 30 May – North-West",True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

Start with the only information that is global:

• Rule 9 restricts A to {3,4,7,8}.  
  – A = 3 or 7 requires I > J.  
  – A = 4 or 8 requires I < J.

• Rule 10 restricts B to {0,2,3,9}.  
  – J > A forces B = 0 or 9.  
  – J < A forces B = 2 or 3.

Case A = 8 (so I < J, and J < 8 because J cannot be 9):

 Then B must come from {2,3} (since J < A).  
 Take B = 2 (the choice B = 3 is symmetric and quickly fails).

Rule 1 (A>B true) ⇒ C = 5 or 7.

 Sub-case C = 5 fails after a short chain, so choose C = 7.

Rule 2 (B<C false) ⇒ D = 4 or 9.  
 Pick D = 4 (D = 9 leads to a dead end).

Rule 3 (C>D true)  ⇒ E = 6 or 9.  
 E = 6 fails, so take E = 9.

Rule 4 (D>E false) ⇒ F = 1 or 6.  
 Choose F = 6 (F = 1 fails).

Rule 5 (E>F true)  ⇒ G = 5 or 6 → G = 5 (6 already used).

Rule 6 (F>G true)  ⇒ H = 1 or 4 → H = 1 (4 already used).

Rule 7 (G>H true)  ⇒ I = 0 or 8 → I = 0 (8 is A).

Rule 8 (H>I true)  ⇒ J = 3 or 8 → J = 3 (8 used).

Now check Rules 9 & 10 with these digits:

I=0 < J=3, so Rule 9 demands A = 4 or 8 → A = 8 (OK).  
J=3 < A=8, so Rule 10 demands B = 2 or 3 → B = 2 (OK).

We have the permutation  
A B C D E F G H I J

Digits 0–9 all appear exactly once, and every rule is satisfied:

1) 8>2 ⇒ C=7 (5/7) ✔  
2) 2<7 ⇒ D=4 (4/9) ✔  
3) 7>4 ⇒ E=9 (6/9) ✔  
4) 4<9 ⇒ F=6 (1/6) ✔

Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.

1.  House positions: 1 2 3 4 5 (left → right).

2.  From (9) the Norwegian lives in the 1st house.

3.  From (14) the Norwegian lives next to the blue house → house 2 is blue.

4.  (4) says the green house is immediately left of the white house.  
    Since house 2 is blue, the only possible green/white pairs are (4,5).  
    ⇒ house 4 is green, house 5 is white.

5.  (5) The green-house owner drinks coffee → house 4 drinks coffee.

6.  The middle house (3) drinks milk (8).

7.  Colors now used: yellow and red are left for houses 1 and 3.  
    (7) The yellow-house owner smokes Dunhill.  
    House 1 cannot be red (Norwegian ≠ Brit), so  
    ⇒ house 1 is yellow, smokes Dunhill; house 3 is red.

8.  (1) The Brit lives in the red house → house 3’s nationality is Brit.

9.  (11) The horse owner lives next to the Dunhill smoker.  
    Dunhill is in house 1, so the horse is in house 2.

10. (3) The Dane drinks tea → Dane must be in a house whose drink is not yet fixed.  
    Candidate houses: 2 or 5.  (we’ll test 2 first).

11. Assume house 2 is Dane (tea).  
    Drinks now: house 1 ?, house 2 tea, house 3 milk, house 4 coffee, house 5 ?  
    Remaining drinks: water, beer.

12. (12) The Bluemasters smoker drinks beer.  
    House 1 already smokes Dunhill, so Bluemasters cannot be there.  
    Therefore beer (and Bluemasters) must be in house 5.

13. Consequently water must be the only drink left for house 1.

14. (15) The Blends smoker lives next to the one who drinks water → Blends is in house 2.

15. (10) The Blends smoker lives next to the one who keeps cats →  
    Cats are in house 1 or house 3.  (we’ll fix this shortly).

16. Cigars so far  
    House 1 Dunhill, House 2 Blends, House 5 Bluemasters.  
    Remaining brands: Pall Mall, Prince.

17. Pets so far  
    House 2 horse, Cats ? , Dogs ? , Birds ? , Fish ?.

18. (6) Pall Mall owner keeps birds.  
    (13) The German smokes Prince.

    The only houses without a cigar yet are 3 and 4.  
    • If house 3 had Prince it would make the Brit German – impossible.  
    ⇒ House 4 smokes Prince → house 4’s nationality is German.  
    ⇒ House 3 smokes Pall Mall → house 3 keeps birds.

19. The only nationality still unused is Swede, so house 5 is Swede.  
    (2) The Swede keeps dogs → house 5 keeps dogs.

20. Pets now: house 1 ?, house 2 horse, house 3 birds, house 4 ?, house 5 dogs.  
    Cats must be adjacent to Blends (house 2).  
    House 3 already has birds, so cats must be in house 1.

21. The only pet that has not been assigned yet is fish → it belongs to house 4.

22. House 4 is German (step 18).  
    Therefore the German owns the fish.

All original clues are now satisfied, so the deduction is consistent.

Final answer: The German owns the fish.",True
16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

Insert P from (E) into (H) and (L):

(L)  B + 2M + 3I + 4(S + 2) = 190 ⇒ B + 2M + 3I + 4S = 182 … (2)

From (T): 2B = 3I – 1 ⇒ B = (3I – 1)/2 … (3)  
I must be odd.

Substituting (3) in (1) and (2) and eliminating M gives I = 17, B = 25.

Put I and B back into (1): 2S + 25 + M + 17 = 95 ⇒ M = 53 – 2S … (4)

All counts must be positive, distinct, and the largest exceeds the smallest by exactly 10 (Condition 3).  
Because B = 25 is within the five values, the smallest count m satisfies 15 ≤ m ≤ 25 and the largest is m + 10 ≤ 35.

Choose S so that every count  (S, P = S+2, M = 53–2S, I = 17, B = 25) lies between m and m+10, all are distinct, and the range is 10.

Trying S = 19 gives  
S = 19, P = 21, M = 15, I = 17, B = 25  
These are all distinct; min = 15, max = 25, and max – min = 10.  
They automatically satisfy all earlier equations, hence meet every condition.

20,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,Final answer: Mr. K,True

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Strategy agreed upon during the night  

Meaning of the two possible words  
    “black”  =  “I see an odd number of black hats in front of me.”  
    “white”  =  “I see an even number of black hats in front of me.”  

(The word is also, of course, taken by the monster to be the speaker’s guess for his own hat.)

Morning – how the game is played  

1.  Person 10 (the one at the back who sees everybody else) counts the black hats he sees.
        – If the number is odd he says “black”, otherwise he says “white”.
        – He may live or die (50 % chance), but everyone has now learnt
          the parity (odd/even) of the black hats on persons 1–9.

2.  Person 9 now knows
        (a) the parity just announced for persons 1–9, and
        (b) the exact colours of persons 1–8 (he can see them).
    • He counts the black hats on 1–8.
        – If this count has the same parity as the one announced, his own hat must
          be white (otherwise the parity person 10 announced would have been different).
        – If the parities differ, his own hat must be black.
    • He says that colour.  His deduction is certain, so he survives.
    • If he has just said “black”, the running parity for the still-unknown hats
      flips; if he said “white” it stays the same.  Thus everybody still alive
      knows the parity of the unrevealed hats.

3.  Persons 8, 7, …, 1 repeat exactly the same reasoning:
        – they all know the current parity of the unknown hats,
        – they see every unknown hat except their own,
        – by comparing the two parities they determine their own colour with
          certainty, announce it, and (if it is black) flip the running parity
          for the benefit of the next person.

Outcome  

• Persons 9 through 1 always answer correctly and therefore survive.  
• Person 10 is correct with probability ½.  

Hence at least 9 of the 10 inhabitants are guaranteed to live, and on average 9.5 will live. No strategy can guarantee all 10, because person 10 has no information about his own hat other than what he can encode in a single word, so one bit of uncertainty necessarily remains.

Final answer: A strategy based on announcing the parity (odd/even) of the black hats seen — “black” for odd, “white” for even — lets all but possibly the last person survive, guaranteeing 9 lives (and 9.5 on average), which is optimal.",True
23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:30        Elena        0:50 later, 1:30 after Derec, 1:20 after Adele
7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.
Finally, we have Caleb and Derec to fill the first and last spots.  Caleb and Nora share a birth position.  The first paragraph mentions that Cogita is Nora's older sister, so Caleb cannot be the firstborn.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
24,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We must find a 10-digit permutation ABCDEFGHIJ of 0–9 satisfying  

1. A + D is a perfect square  
2. G + J is a triangular number (Tn = n(n+1)/2 ≤ 17 → 1,3,6,10,15)  
3. B + I is even  
4. E·F is odd (so E and F are odd digits)  
5. C·H is prime (so one factor is 1, the other a prime digit 2,3,5,7)  
6. A / G = G / C  ⇒  A·C = G²  
7. E + I = B + H  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Solve A·C = G² with distinct digits 0–9.  
The only possibilities are  
(G,A,C) = (2,4,1), (3,9,1), (4,8,2), (6,9,4).  
Applying condition 5 (prime product) keeps only the first three, and they force  

• (A,C,G,H) = (4,1,2,H)  with H in {3,5,7}  
• (9,1,3,H) with H in {2,5,7}  
• (8,2,4,1)  

The other two cases are eliminated later; we pursue the first one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Fix G + J triangular with G = 2.  
2 + J ∈ {3,6,10,15}.  
Distinct-digit requirement leaves only 2 + 8 = 10, so J = 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Fix A + D square with A = 4.  
4 + D ∈ {4,9,16}.  With a single digit D this gives D = 0 or 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Work with B, E, F, I, using conditions 3,4,7.  
Digits now used: {4,1,2,8} plus H (3 or 5 or 7) and D (0 or 5).

Take H = 3 first.

Available digits: 0,5,6,7,9.  
Even digits: 0,6  Odd digits: 5,7,9.

Choose B and I to be the two even digits (0 and 6); parity condition (3) is met.  
Try (B,I) = (6,0):

 E + 0 = 6 + 3   ⇒   E = 9  (valid, distinct, odd).  
Odd digits left for F: 5 or 7.  Pick F = 7.

Check D: 0 already used by I, so D must be 5.

Digits are now  
A=4, B=6, C=1, D=5, E=9, F=7, G=2, H=3, I=0, J=8

They are all different and exhaust 0–9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Verify all conditions.

1. A + D = 4 + 5 = 9  (square)  
2. G + J = 2 + 8 = 10 (triangular)  
3. B + I = 6 + 0 = 6 (even)  
4. E·F = 9·7 = 63 (odd)  
5. C·H = 1·3 = 3 (prime)  
6. A/G = 4/2 = 2 and G/C = 2/1 = 2 (equal)  
7. E + I = 9 + 0 = 9 and B + H = 6 + 3 = 9 (equal)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6.  Uniqueness.

• Trying H = 5 or 7 produces no admissible E,F.  
• The alternative initial triples (9,1,3, H) and (8,2,4,1) fail because they leave too few odd digits for E and F or violate condition 1.  

Hence the solution found is unique.

The mango is also packed with vitamins A, B and C.
While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:

Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)

Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy

Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""

""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal

""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher

29,"One day, an eccentric billionaire decided to give a destitute man a break. But not a total break, as we shall see. So, he invites him into a room in his mansion with seven doors. There is also a large-screen projector that projects the following five images, repeatedly, one at a time:
A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.
The poor man was allowed an entire day to study the images, after which he would have to choose the door that corresponded to the commonality of the images. The next day the man walked through the correct door, and the billionaire made him rich. What door did the man choose?","Take a snack break, have one of the images.","The man chose door number FOUR. Here's why:
The image of the human brain made the man think of 'four corners of the mind.'
He recognized the capital letters AZCONMUT to be the abbreviations of the 'Four corner states' Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. He completed the phrase
'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners. Thus, the poor guy walked into a mansion poorer than poor, and walked out with a cheese sandwich, and enough dough to buy a small country. What he actually did with the money is anybody's guess.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step  

1. The human brain  
   – Anatomically it is divided (in each hemisphere) into four principal lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital.  
   ⇒ Hints at the number 4.

2. The Earth  
   – We traditionally speak of the four cardinal directions (“the four corners of the Earth”).  
   ⇒ Again, a reference to 4.

3. The incomplete phrase “Fair and ____”  
   – The only common completion is “square”.  
   – A square is the most familiar figure that possesses exactly four equal sides and four right-angle corners.  
   ⇒ Another pointer to 4.

4. The letters “AZ CO NM UT”  
   – These are the postal abbreviations of the four U.S. states Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.  
   – They are famous for meeting at a single point called the “Four Corners”.  
   ⇒ Yet another clear allusion to 4.

5. A cheese sandwich on white bread with the edges neatly cut off  
   – Standard sliced white bread is a square; trimming the crust removes the four outside edges.  
   – What remains is a perfect little square – again a shape characterized by four equal sides.  
   ⇒ Still pointing to 4.

All five pictures, in their own ways, shout “FOUR”.

2. The room has seven doors.  
   – The only thing we have deduced is the number 4, so the correct door must be the one that corresponds to that number.

Therefore the destitute man walked through the fourth door (the door labelled “4”).",True

32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

34,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.

8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in full:

Let n be the actual number of blue-eyed islanders.  
Let us prove, by induction on n, what happens after the guru makes the public statement

“I see a person with blue eyes.”

Base step (n = 1)  
• Each islander sees the other 199 people.  
• The single blue-eyed person sees no one with blue eyes.  
• Because the guru has asserted that at least one blue pair exists, that lone person deduces it must be his own.  
• He is now absolutely certain and boards the first night’s ship.  
• Everyone else sees him leave, realises their own eyes are not blue, and stays.

Induction step  
Assume that if there are exactly n blue-eyed islanders, they all leave simultaneously on the n-th night.  
Now suppose there are n + 1 blue-eyed islanders. Each of them sees exactly n others with blue eyes.

Each blue-eyed islander reasons as follows:  
“If my eyes were not blue, there would be only n blue-eyed people. By the induction hypothesis they would all leave on night n. If nobody leaves on night n, I will know my eyes are blue.”

All brown-eyed people run a similar line of thought but never reach certainty.

What actually happens:  
• Nights 1, 2, … , n: nobody leaves, because every blue-eyed person is still unsure.  
• When night n passes with no departures, every blue-eyed islander now knows the count must be n + 1 and therefore that he himself is blue.  
• On night n + 1 they can state their eye colour with certainty, and all leave together.

Conclusion for the given numbers

Here n + 1 = 100, so n = 99 in the inductive description; equivalently, with 100 blue-eyed islanders:

- Nights 1 through 99: no one leaves.  
- Night 100: the 100 blue-eyed islanders, having become certain, all announce “My eyes are blue” and board the ship.  
- The 100 brown-eyed islanders can never become certain and therefore remain.

Final answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night; everyone else stays.",True
38,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

x = the largest number of throws we are willing to need in the worst case.  
With two balls every experiment consists of  
• one throw with the first ball; if it breaks we may still make at most (x–1) further throws with the second ball while searching line-by-line downward through the last interval;  
• if it does not break we have used one throw and must still finish in at most (x–1) further throws.

Therefore, after the first throw we must have shortened the remaining unknown range by exactly (x–1) floors; after the second throw by (x–2) more floors, etc.  
So, if the first ball is to be thrown at most x times, the sequence of jump sizes must be

x , (x–1) , (x–2) , … , 2 , 1

and the total number of floors that these jumps cover is

x + (x–1) + (x–2) + … + 2 + 1 = x(x+1)/2.

We need this sum to be at least the 100 floors of the building while x itself is as small as possible:

x(x+1)/2 ≥ 100  
x² + x – 200 ≥ 0  
x ≈ ( –1 + √801 ) / 2 ≈ 13.65.  

Hence the smallest integer x that works is 14.

Thus the increments between successive throws of the first ball should be  
14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Cumulative floor numbers (where you let the first ball fall) are therefore

14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 102† …
(† we stop at or before 100 because the building ends.)

Practically, you use this schedule:

1. Drop at floor 14.  
   – If it breaks, test floors 1–13 one by one with the second ball (at most 13 more throws; total ≤14).  
   – If it survives, go on.

2. Drop at floor 27 (=14+13).  
   – If it breaks, test floors 15–26 sequentially (≤13 throws left).  
   – Otherwise continue.

3. Drop at floor 39 (=27+12).

4. Drop at floor 50 (=39+11).

5. Drop at floor 60 (=50+10).

6. Drop at floor 69 (=60+9).

7. Drop at floor 77 (=69+8).

8. Drop at floor 84 (=77+7).

9. Drop at floor 90 (=84+6).

10. Drop at floor 95 (=90+5).

11. Drop at floor 99 (=95+4).

12. Finally drop at floor 100 if the first ball has still not broken.

Whichever floor is the first to break the first ball, search the floors below it and above the previous safe floor one by one with the second ball.  

Because the preliminary gaps shrink by one each time, the total number of drops you will ever need (first-ball drops + possible second-ball linear search) is never more than 14, and 14 is the minimum possible with only two balls.

Final answer: Drop the first ball in the sequence of floors  
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100 …  
(stop once it breaks or when you reach the top). After it breaks, test the remaining floors in the last interval one by one with the second ball; this strategy guarantees finding the highest safe floor using at most 14 drops, which is optimal.",True

3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.

Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let R be the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves, with 1 ≤ R ≤ 99.  
All statements below are common knowledge to every dwarf.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Every dwarf can see the 99 other hats.  
   • A red-hatted dwarf sees R – 1 red hats.  
   • A blue-hatted dwarf sees R red hats.

2. Base case: suppose R = 1.  
   The lone red dwarf sees 0 red hats.  
   But it is publicly known that at least one red hat exists, so he must be the red one.  
   He stays away the very next morning.  
   ⇒ If nobody appears in a red hat on the 1st morning, all red hats are gone.

3. Inductive step: assume the rule is true for every number < k.  
   Now let R = k (k ≥ 2).  
   Each red dwarf sees k – 1 red hats; each blue sees k.  
   Every dwarf reasons:
   “If there were only k – 1 red hats, they would have disappeared after k – 1 days.”
   
   All dwarves therefore watch what happens:
   • For the first k – 1 mornings, no one leaves (otherwise everyone would instantly know R was smaller).  
   • When the k-th morning arrives and no one has yet left, each red dwarf now knows the
     total cannot be k – 1 (because the induction hypothesis would have emptied the party
     by now). Since he himself is the only uncertainty in his own count, he concludes
     he must also be red.  
   • All k red-hatted dwarves stay away starting on the k-th morning.

4. Consequently, after exactly R days every red-hatted dwarf has learned his hat color and has stopped attending. Blue-hatted dwarves never leave.

Answer

If there are R red hats, they disappear after R nights of reasoning. Hence:

Final answer: The number of days equals the number of red-hatted dwarves (R).",True

Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.

1. The sum of the top row is greater than the sum of the middle row, which is greater than the sum of the bottom row.
2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning:

1. There are 9 different letters, so the numbers 1 – 9 are each used once.

2. Statement 2 says E is a prime factor of G.  
   • The only primes ≤ 9 are 2, 3, 5, 7.  
   • If E = 5 or 7, the only multiple ≤ 9 would be the same number, which is not allowed.  
   • So E is 2 or 3.

3. Statement 4 is B + G = H.  Since every number is at most 9, we need B + G ≤ 9.

4. Try E = 3.  Then G could be 6 or 9.  
   • If G = 6, B must be 1, 2, 3 (to keep B + G ≤ 9), giving H 7, 8, 9, but the bottom-row sum (G + H + I) is then at least 6 + 7 + 1 = 14 and usually larger.  
   • If G = 9, B + G ≤ 9 is impossible.  
   Therefore E cannot be 3.  Hence E = 2.

5. With E = 2, G must be a multiple of 2 different from 2: G = 4, 6, 8.  
   • G = 6 or 8 forces the bottom-row sum to exceed 14, contradicting the fact that the three row-sums must add to 45 and be strictly increasing.  
   • Therefore G = 4.

6. Because B + 4 = H and numbers are ≤ 9: possibilities are  
      (B,H) = (1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (5,9).

7. The total of the three rows is 45.  If the smallest row sum is x, then the next two must be at least x + 1 and x + 2, so  
      x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) ≤ 45  ⇒  x ≤ 14.  
   So the bottom-row sum must be ≤ 14.

8. Compute the bottom-row sum G + H + I = 4 + H + I.

   • (B,H) = (1,5): sum = 9 + I ⇒ need 9 + I ≤ 14, so I ≤ 5.  
     I must be different from 1,2,4,5, so I can only be 3.  Bottom-row sum = 12.  Works.

   • (B,H) = (2,6): I would have to be 3 to keep the sum ≤ 14, but 2 is already used for E, duplicates not allowed.  
   • (B,H) = (3,7): I would have to be 2, duplicating E.  
   • (B,H) = (5,9): impossible (sum already ≥ 18).

   Thus the only viable choice is B = 1, H = 5, I = 3, giving bottom-row sum 12.

9. The unused numbers are 6, 7, 8, 9 and go to A, C, D, F.  Statement 3 says F > A.

   Try possibilities (keeping top-row > middle-row > 12):

   A  F | remaining C,D | top row A+1+C | middle row D+2+F
   -------------------------------------------------------
   6  7 | 8,9 : 15 or 16 | 18 or 19   (top<mid)  ✗  
   6  8 | 7,9 : 14 or 16 | 19 or 17   (top<mid)  ✗  
   6  9 | 7,8 : 14 or 15 | 19 or 18   (top<mid)  ✗  
   7  8 | 6,9 : 14 or 17 | 17 or 16   (top>mid)  ✓  
   7  9 | 6,8 : 14 or 16 | 19 or 17   (top<mid)  ✗  
   8  9 | 6,7 : 15 or 16 | 18 or 17   (top<mid)  ✗  

   Only A = 7, F = 8, C = 9, D = 6 gives
        top row 7 + 1 + 9 = 17,
        middle row 6 + 2 + 8 = 16,
        bottom row 4 + 5 + 3 = 12,
   and 17 > 16 > 12.

10. All conditions are satisfied and every number 1 – 9 is used exactly once.

Therefore the unique solution is

A = 7  
B = 1  
C = 9  
D = 6  
E = 2  
F = 8  
G = 4  
H = 5  
I = 3

Logical restrictions

1.  Mrs J (Russian only) must occupy an end–seat and her only possible neighbour is Mrs H.  
2.  Mrs L (French only) must occupy the other end–seat and her only neighbour is Mrs G or Mrs M.  
3.  Mrs M (Fr,Ge) can sit only next to somebody who speaks French (G,L) or German (N).  
4.  All other ladies speak English, so they can sit next to any English-speaker.

Because an arrangement and its complete reversal are regarded as the same, we may fix Mrs J at the left end.  
So the row always begins

J H … … … … … … …

Let the right–hand end be occupied by L and let x be her neighbour (seat 8).

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

We must end in a position where, whatever the true (unknown) speeds of the 25 horses are, we can name without any doubt the 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-fastest.  
The argument proceeds in two parts: a construction that reaches the goal in 7 races, and a proof that 6 can never be enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1 – A schedule that works in 7 races
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Label the horses A1 … A5, B1 … B5, … , E1 … E5 in five groups of five.

Race 1–5   (5 races)  
Race each group once to order the horses inside the group.

Assume (for definiteness) the results are

   A1 A2 A3 A4 A5  
   B1 B2 B3 B4 B5  
   C1 C2 C3 C4 C5  
   D1 D2 D3 D4 D5  
   E1 E2 E3 E4 E5

Race 6 – the “winners race”  
Run A1 B1 C1 D1 E1.  Suppose they finish

   1 A1 2 B1 3 C1 4 D1 5 E1.

What do we know now?

• All horses in D and E are slower than at least three horses (A1, B1, C1), so none of them can be among the overall top-3.  
• In group C, only C1 can still be top-3 (C2 is slower than C1, which is already at most 3rd).  
• In group B, only B1 and B2 can still be top-3.  
• In group A, only A1, A2 and A3 can still be top-3.

So the only remaining candidates are
 A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.                    (6 horses)

We already know from Race 6 that A1 is faster than the other five, so A1 is definitely the overall #1.  
We still must decide #2 and #3 among the five horses

 A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.

Race 7 – the decisive race  
Run exactly those five horses: A2 A3 B1 B2 C1.  
The first-place finisher in this race is overall #2, the second-place finisher is overall #3, and we are done.

Thus we have finished the task in 7 races.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2 – Why 6 races cannot suffice
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine we had stopped after the “winners race” (6 races total).  
In the concrete outcome written above we would know

 A1 > B1 > C1 > D1 > E1  
 A1 > A2 > A3 > A4 > A5  
 B1 > B2 > B3 > B4 > B5  
 C1 > C2 > C3 > C4 > C5.

But none of the pairs (A2, B1), (A2, C1), (B1, A3), (B1, C1), … have ever met.  
Two different hidden speed tables, both compatible with all six race results, could make the overall #2 be A2 in one case and B1 in another. Therefore after only 6 races it is still impossible to state with certainty who the 2nd- and 3rd-fastest horses are. At least one more race is indispensable.

Consequently 7 races are both sufficient and necessary.

Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.
4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.
5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.
10) Check both machines that were active and are now turned off. The one that is warmer is connected to switch B (since it was on most recently), and the cooler one is connected to switch C (which was turned off first).
11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  While he is in the sawing room the first time he makes sure that the machine switches on the machines themselves are all in the ON position.  
    (They already are, because the saws are working, so he need not touch them at all.)

2.  He now leaves the room and is never again able to see or hear the machines until he re-enters at the end.

3.  Outside the door he does the following with the five back-up switches.

        a)  Turn all five back-up switches OFF and wait long enough for every saw
            to stop and for the motors to cool to roughly the same temperature
            (say 20–30 minutes).

        b)  Choose an order for the five outside switches; call them
            S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , S5.

        c)  Switch S1 ON and leave it ON.

        d)  Switch S2 ON for 8 minutes, then turn it OFF again.

        e)  Switch S3 ON for 4 minutes, then turn it OFF again.

        f)  Switch S4 ON for 2 minutes, then turn it OFF again.

        g)  Leave S5 OFF the whole time.

    Because the machine switches inside are still ON, every time a back-up
    switch is ON its saw runs and its motor warms up; when that back-up switch
    is turned OFF the saw stops and the motor begins to cool.

4.  At once he goes back into the room.

    •  Exactly one machine is still running – the one fed by S1.  
    •  Of the stopped saws the hottest motor belongs to S2 (8-minute run),  
       the next-hottest to S3 (4 minutes),  
       the next to S4 (2 minutes),  
       and the completely cold machine belongs to S5 (never switched on).

    By feeling which machine is running and by comparing the relative
    warmth of the other four motors he can identify, without any
    possibility of error, which outside switch controls which machine.

5.  He now knows the complete matching and can tell the manager.

Final answer:  He uses the outside switches to run the five machines for different lengths of time (one left running, three run for long/medium/short periods, one never run).  On re-entering he identifies the still-running machine and orders the stopped machines by how warm their motors feel; these five distinct “temperatures” give a one-to-one correspondence between the five outside switches and the five machines.",True

But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"To decide whether a single 22-ton (≈22 000 L) road tanker can sensibly keep the flight supplied we first have to understand how much water is really lost from the summit pound whenever a boat passes the 13-lock flight.

1.  What happens when a boat goes through one lock  
   • A lockful of water (≈7 000 L) is let out of the upper pound into the lock.  
   • After the boat has risen (or fallen) and left, that same lockful is emptied into the lower pound.  
   • Net result: one lockful of water has moved from the lock’s upper pound to its lower pound.

2.  What happens along the whole flight  
   Start with the boat in the bottom pound.  
   – Lock 1 moves 7 000 L from Pound 1 to Pound 0 (bottom).  
   – Lock 2 then moves 7 000 L from Pound 2 to Pound 1, replacing what Pound 1 just lost.  
   – Lock 3 moves 7 000 L from Pound 3 to Pound 2, replacing what Pound 2 just lost.  
   … and so on …  
   – Lock 13 finally moves 7 000 L from the summit pound to Pound 12.

   Every intermediate pound loses 7 000 L to the lock below but gains 7 000 L from the lock above, so its net change is zero.  
   The only pound that is not compensated is the summit pound itself, which has no pound above it. Consequently:

   Water actually lost from the summit per complete passage of the flight = 1 lockful = 7 000 L.

3.  Compare with the tanker capacity  
   Capacity of the hired tanker = 22 000 L  
   Number of lockfuls that represents = 22 000 / 7 000 ≈ 3.1

   Hence one tanker load replaces the water needed for roughly three boat passages of the whole 13-lock flight.

4.  Verdict on the contract  
   Because only one lockful (not thirteen lockfuls) is lost from the summit each time a boat uses the flight, a 22-ton load is large enough to keep the flight in operation for several boats between deliveries. Therefore hiring such a tanker is perfectly reasonable; the volume it carries is ample for the amount of water that actually has to be replaced.

Final answer: Yes, the contract is reasonable; only one lockful (≈7 000 L) is lost from the summit per complete passage, so a 22-ton tanker can replace the loss for about three boats, more than sufficient for practical operation.",True

Let the 10-digit code be  
p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10,  
each pi a different digit 0–9.

1.  p5 · p10 is odd ⇒ p5 and p10 are odd.  
2.  p4 + p9 = p10 and p9 is even ⇒ p4 must be odd and p4 + p9 ≤ 9 (single digit).  
3.  p3 + p4 = p6 · p9.  The left side, a sum of two odd digits, is even and ≤ 18, so the product on the right is one of  
   4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.
4.  Because every odd digit except one is now fixed (p3, p4, p5, p10 are already odd and there are only five odd digits in total), exactly one of p1, p2, p6, p7, p8 is odd.
5.  Chains of inequalities: p8 > p6 > p2 > p5 > p7.

Work through the possible even p9 and compatible p6:

p9 = 2  ⇒ p6 ∈ {3,4,5,6,7,8} (products 6,8,10,12,14,16)  
p9 = 4  ⇒ p6 ∈ {1,2,3}          (products 4,8,12)  
p9 = 6  ⇒ p6 ∈ {1,2}            (products 6,12)  
p9 = 8  ⇒ p6 ∈ {1,2}            (products 8,16)

To satisfy p6 > p2 > p5 > p7 and the single-odd-digit condition among {p1,p2,p6,p7,p8}, choose
 p6 = 3 (odd), p2 = 2 (even), p5 = 1 (odd), p7 = 0 (even).

Then p9 must give a perfect square for p2 + p6 + p9:
 2 + 3 + p9 = perfect square ⇒ 5 + p9 ∈ {4,9,16} ⇒ p9 = 4.

Now p3 + p4 = p6 · p9 = 3 × 4 = 12.  
With remaining odd digits {5,7,9}, the only way is p3 = 7, p4 = 5.

From p4 + p9 = p10: 5 + 4 = 9 ⇒ p10 = 9.

Digits used so far: 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,9.  Left: 6,8 for positions p1 and p8.  
Condition p8 > p6 (3) gives p8 = 6.  
Finally p1 + p5 = p7 + p10 ⇒ p1 + 1 = 0 + 9 ⇒ p1 = 8.

All constraints check:

p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10  
8  2  7  5  1  3  0  6  4  9

• Each digit 0–9 used once.  
• 7+5 = 3·4.  
• 1·9 odd.  
• 2>1>0.  
• 6>3>2.  
• 2+3+4 = 9 square.  
• 5+4 = 9.

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Company B never changed the real price of building the whole bridge – they always needed one million dollars to do the job.  
What the contractor changed was the way the price was presented.

1. He cut the three-mile bridge into three separate “jobs”.  
 • First mile … 200 000 $  
 • Second mile … a further 550 000 $ (total now 750 000 $)  
 • Third mile … a final 250 000 $ (total now 1 000 000 $)

2. He told the Emperor:  
 “After each stage you can stop if you wish.  
 If you stop after the first mile you will have paid only 200 000 $.  
 If you stop after the second mile you will have paid 750 000 $.  
 If you let me finish all three miles you will pay 1 000 000 $.”

3. To the Emperor the proposal sounded wonderful:  
 • He could start the project for only 200 000 $, far less than Company A’s 800 000 $ bid.  
 • Even after two miles the outlay would still be less than Company A’s full price.

4. But once the first mile had been built the Emperor had nothing useful – the bridge still stopped in the ocean.  
 Stopping made no sense, so he told the contractor to continue.  
After two miles the situation was the same – still no connection between the islands – so again he had no real choice but to let the work go on.

58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

n = number of friends  (n < 10)  
T = total Golden kebab tokens  
s = tokens each friend first received  

1.  The tokens were first divided equally: T = n s.

2.  If they were divided by families:  
   • Two pairs of sisters form 2 families of size 2.  
   • The remaining n – 4 friends (including Norha Bone) each form a one-person family.  
   ⇒ Number of families F = 2 + (n – 4) = n – 2.

   The share per family would then be T ⁄ F.  
   We are told this family share is 5 more than the individual share s:

         T /(n – 2) = s + 5.

   Substitute T = n s:

         n s /(n – 2) = s + 5  
   ⇒    n s = (n – 2)(s + 5)  
   ⇒    n s = (n – 2)s + 5(n – 2)  
   ⇒    2s = 5(n – 2)  
   ⇒    s = (5/2)(n – 2).

   For s to be an integer, (n – 2) must be even ⇒ n is even.  
   With n < 10 and n ≥ 5 (there are at least 4 sisters plus Norha), the possibilities are n = 6 or n = 8.

   • n = 6 → s = (5/2)(4) = 10.  
   • n = 8 → s = (5/2)(6) = 15.

3.  Wendy Boatkumsin then gives up her share.  
   Her  s  tokens are to be divided equally among the remaining n – 1 friends, so s must be divisible by n – 1.

   • n = 6:  n – 1 = 5, 10 ÷ 5 = 2  ✓  
   • n = 8:  n – 1 = 7, 15 ÷ 7 is not an integer ✗  

   Therefore n = 6, s = 10, and T = n s = 60.

4.  Final division.  
   Wendy keeps 0.  
   Her 10 tokens are split among the other 5 friends: each gets an extra 10 ⁄ 5 = 2.

   Hence each of those 5 friends ends with 10 + 2 = 12 tokens.

Final answer: There were 6 friends; after the last redistribution Wendy had none, and each of the other five friends ended up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",True

At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest

-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.

61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"The only thing that matters in the duel is the relative strength of the two draughts that are drunk in each body:

• a poison that is followed by a stronger one is rendered harmless;  
• the last (strongest) poison that remains un-neutralised kills.

Let P be the pharmacist’s official poison and T the treasurer’s official poison.
After the ceremony

 pharmacist   drinks T   then P  
 treasurer    drinks P   then T

so the pharmacist lives iff P is stronger than T, and the treasurer lives iff T is stronger than P.

────────────────────────────────────────
The treasurer’s idea
────────────────────────────────────────
1.  He mixes an ordinary (not very strong) poison of his own.
2.  The night before the contest he sneaks into the pharmacist’s laboratory, steals a little of the poison he finds there and pours it into his own flask.
   •  Whatever the pharmacist prepared must be stronger than what the treasurer could make.
   •  By putting some of that stronger liquid into his own bottle he guarantees that his bottle will be at least as strong as the pharmacist’s, so he should survive and the pharmacist should die.

────────────────────────────────────────
What the pharmacist guessed
────────────────────────────────────────
The pharmacist realised that the only way the treasurer could hope to win was by stealing some of his poison.  
Therefore, on the last day he set a trap:

1.  He brewed a very weak poison W, put it in a conspicuous flask and left it where it could easily be found.
2.  He brewed a really strong poison S, corked it tightly and hid it.
3.  That night the treasurer indeed broke in, found the conspicuous flask, took a little of W and poured it into his own bottle.
   – Instead of strengthening his mixture he actually diluted it; his poison became weaker than before.
4.  Next morning the pharmacist took the hidden flask containing S to the king; the treasurer brought his now-diluted mixture.

────────────────────────────────────────
The drinking
────────────────────────────────────────
•  The pharmacist drank T (the treasurer’s now very weak poison) and then S (his own strong one).  
   S was stronger than T, so both were neutralised and he lived.

•  The treasurer drank S first and then T.  
   T was too weak to neutralise S, so the strong poison remained active and he died.

────────────────────────────────────────
After-effects
────────────────────────────────────────
The pharmacist survived, the treasurer died, and the king did not obtain “the strongest poison in the kingdom”: the pharmacist had brought only enough strength to outclass the treasurer’s brew and had kept the formula of an even stronger poison to himself.

Final answer:  
The treasurer planned to steal some of the pharmacist’s poison and mix it with his own so that his flask would end up the stronger. Anticipating this, the pharmacist left a decoy flask containing a very weak poison where it could be stolen and kept his real strong poison hidden. The treasurer unknowingly diluted his own poison with the weak decoy, making it weaker than the pharmacist’s. At the ceremony the pharmacist therefore drank a weaker poison followed by a stronger one and lived, while the treasurer drank a stronger poison followed by a weaker one and died. Thus the pharmacist survived and the treasurer perished, and the king still did not get the strongest poison.",True

3. There was only one day in that month that all three men went to the pub.
On which day of that month did all three men go to the bar?","From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.","All three men went on the 27th.
From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd. This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. Edgar went to the pub on Monday the 1st and every two days thereafter, Frank went on Wednesday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and George went on Friday the 5th and every seven days thereafter.
2. Frank went on Wednesday the 1st and every two days thereafter, George went on Friday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and Edgar went on Monday the 6th and every seven days thereafter.

A patron who goes every k days visits exactly the days that are ≡ r (mod k) for some residue r.  
His first visit in a month must therefore be one of the first k days of that month.

Step 1.  Find a compatible assignment of the periods 2, 3, 7.

Try all 6 ways to assign the periods to Edgar (E), Frank (F) and George (G) and, for each, see

First intersect Frank and George:

 Odd numbers that are multiples of 3 ⇒ 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, …

These are the numbers ≡ 3 (mod 6).

Now intersect with Edgar’s set (numbers ≡ 6 mod 7).

Solve n ≡ 3 (mod 6)  
    n ≡ 6 (mod 7).

Chinese Remainder Theorem gives the unique solution mod 42

 n ≡ 27 (mod 42).

The first such number in the month is n = 27.  
Because the next common day would be 27 + 42 = 69 (> 31), the 27th is the only day that month on which all three men meet, satisfying condition 3 of the problem.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

68,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = AD
2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5
4) B * I = AJ","The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.","2951804637
A = 2, B = 9, C = 5, D = 1, E = 8, F = 0, G = 4, H = 6, I = 3, J = 7
1) 9 + 5 + 0 + 7 = 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 21
2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.
H) The last four letters can now be assigned values.  D = 1, E = 8, G = 4, and H = 6.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We translate each clue into equations on the ten different digits A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J:

1. B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = 10A + D        (AD is the two-digit number with digits A and D)
2. B − H = J − G = 3                               ⇒  B = H + 3 ,  G = J − 3
3. C − F = E − I = 5                               ⇒  C = F + 5 ,  E = I + 5
4. B × I = AJ                                       (two-digit product with tens A, units J)

Step 1:  Use (1) to compare the two equal sums

   B + C + F + J  =  E + G + H + I  
⇒ (H+3) + (F+5) + F + J = (I+5) + (J−3) + H + I
⇒ 2F + H + J + 8 = 2I + H + J + 2
⇒ 2F − 2I = −6  ⟹  I = F + 3

So F can be 0,1,2,3,4 (because C = F+5 must stay ≤9).

Checking F one by one:

• F = 0 ⟹ I = 3 , C = 5 , E = 8        (all digits distinct so far)  
• F = 1 ⟹ I = 4 , C = 6 , E = 9  
• F = 2,3,4 give E > 9, impossible.

Hence only the two sets (F,I,C,E) = (0,3,5,8) or (1,4,6,9) survive.

Step 2:  Work with clue (4), B×I = AJ, together with I just found.

Case A:  F=0 , I=3  
Then 3B = 10A + J.  
With B a single digit 4–9, the products are:

   B  4 5 6 7 8 9
   3B 12 15 18 21 24 27
   AJ 12 15 18 21 24 27
   J  2 5 8 1 4 7
   A  1 1 1 2 2 2

We must keep all digits distinct and also have J = G+3 , B = H+3.

Only B = 9 works:
   B=9 , AJ =27 ⟹ A=2 , J=7
   H = B−3 = 6
   G = J−3 = 4
All digits 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 distinct – good.

Compute AD = B+C+F+J = 9+5+0+7 = 21 ⇒ D = 1 (A already 2).
Check the other sum: E+G+H+I = 8+4+6+3 = 21.  All clues satisfied.

Case B:  F=1 , I=4  
Then 4B = AJ gives possibilities 12,16,20,24,28,32,36.
Testing each together with uniqueness and B=H+3, J=G+3 shows all fail.

Therefore the only possible solution is the one from Case A.

Digits obtained:
A=2, B=9, C=5, D=1, E=8, F=0, G=4, H=6, I=3, J=7

3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.

We have to discover, with only three YES/NO questions, which one is  

• the Truth-teller (T),  
• the Liar (L),  
• the Alternator (A l) – who alternates T,L,T,L,… and may start either way.

Idea:  
If we ask the same person two questions whose answers we ourselves already know to be TRUE, then  

• a Truth-teller will answer YES, YES,  
• a Liar will answer NO, NO,  
• an Alternator will answer YES, NO or NO, YES.  

Thus with the first two questions we can identify the status of that person completely.  
After that we have one question left; depending on what we have learned we direct that last question so that the other two men are identified.

Questions and analysis
----------------------

Question 1 (to Alex): “Is 1 + 1 = 2?”  
Question 2 (to Alex): “Is 2 + 2 = 4?”

Examine Alex’s two answers.

1. They are identical.  
   • If the two answers are YES, YES → Alex is the Truth-teller.  
   • If the two answers are NO, NO  → Alex is the Liar.  

   Now only Bob and Chuck remain to be classified as “Liar or Alternator” (if Alex is T) or “Truth-teller or Alternator” (if Alex is L).  
   Because we already know whether Alex tells the truth or lies, we can safely ask him one more question:

   Question 3 (to Alex): “Is Bob the Alternator?”

   Interpretation:  
   • If Alex is the Truth-teller, his YES means Bob is the Alternator (so Chuck is the Liar); his NO means Bob is the Liar (so Chuck is the Alternator).  
   • If Alex is the Liar, his YES means Bob is NOT the Alternator (so Bob is the Truth-teller and Chuck the Alternator); his NO means Bob IS the Alternator (so Chuck is the Truth-teller).

   In either sub-case everybody’s role is fixed.

2. Alex’s two answers differ (YES/NO or NO/YES).  
   Therefore Alex is the Alternator.

   The Truth-teller and the Liar are now Bob and Chuck.  
   One last question to either of them settles which is which:

   Question 3 (to Bob, say): “Is 1 + 1 = 2?”

   • If Bob answers YES → Bob is the Truth-teller and Chuck the Liar.  
   • If Bob answers NO  → Bob is the Liar and Chuck the Truth-teller.

After these three questions we know the exact role of every man in every possible scenario.

Final answer: Yes. Ask Alex “Is 1+1=2?” and then “Is 2+2=4?”  
If the two replies are alike, Alex is consistent (truth-teller if two YES’s, liar if two NO’s); ask him “Is Bob the Alternator?” to finish the identification.  
If the two replies differ, Alex is the Alternator; ask Bob “Is 1+1=2?” and his answer tells which of Bob or Chuck is the truth-teller and which the liar.",True

76,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let t be the number of hours that have elapsed since the clock was started at 6 :00.

Which hand is which  
– The short, “hour-hand” shape is on the fast (minute) spindle and therefore turns 360° each hour.  
– The long, “minute-hand” shape is on the slow (hour) spindle and therefore turns 30° each hour.

Initial positions (at 6 :00)  
Fast hand : 180° (pointing at 6)  
Slow hand :   0° (pointing at 12)

1. Positions produced by the faulty mechanism after t hours  
   fast hand θ_fast = 180° + 360°·t  
   slow hand θ_slow = 0°   + 30°·t

2. Positions that a correct clock ought to show after t hours (real time 6 + t)  
   correct hour-hand angle θ_hour = 180° + 30°·t  (the hour hand advances 30° per hour)  
   correct minute-hand angle θ_min  = 360°·fractional part of t (the minute hand makes 360° per hour)

For the clock to “show the right time” we require the shaped hands to occupy exactly these correct angles:

θ_fast ≡ θ_hour (mod 360°) and θ_slow ≡ θ_min (mod 360°).

First condition  
180 + 360t ≡ 180 + 30t (mod 360)  
⇒ 330t ≡ 0 (mod 360)  
⇒ 11t ≡ 0 (mod 12)  
⇒ t = 12k/11 for some integer k.  
The smallest positive value is t = 12/11 hours.

Second condition  
θ_slow = 30t = 30·(12/11) = 360/11 degrees.  
Fractional part of t = (12/11) − 1 = 1/11, so  
θ_min = 360·(1/11) = 360/11 degrees.

Thus θ_slow = θ_min, so the second condition is also satisfied for t = 12/11 hours.

Therefore the very first moment when the clock again shows the correct time is 12/11 hours after 6 :00.

Convert 12/11 hours to ordinary time:  
12/11 h = 1 h + (1/11)h  
(1/11)h = (60/11) min = 5 min + (5/11) min  
(5/11) min = (5/11)·60 s = 300/11 s = 27 3/11 s.

So the clock is correct again at

2 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 21 → 21 IS divisible by 3 → 6 points  

So the rule is:

• If the total of the dice is divisible by 3, you score 6 points.  
• Otherwise, you score 8 points.

Now for 4, 3, 6, 2, 6:

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.
...whew!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Work backwards, always remembering the pirates’ preference order  
1. stay alive, 2. get as much gold as possible, 3. if those are equal get more pirates killed.

Stage with 1 pirate  
P 5 is alone ⇒ gets 1000.

Stage with 2 pirates (P 4 proposes to P 5)  
4 needs a strict majority of the two votes, i.e. both votes.  
5 knows that if he votes No, 4 is killed and he (5) gets 1000 next round.  
No payment 4 can offer beats that, so 4’s proposal can never pass ⇒ P 4 is killed.

Stage with 3 pirates (P 3, 4, 5 – P 3 proposes)  
Now a proposal needs 2 of the 3 votes.  
If 3 is killed, we are in the previous paragraph and 4 is certain to die; 5 then gets 1000.  
Therefore 4 will vote Yes for any plan that keeps him alive (even for 0 gold).  
3 therefore gives everybody 0 and keeps 1000 himself.  
Votes: 3 (Y), 4 (Y), 5 (N) ⇒ plan passes.

Stage with 4 pirates (P 2, 3, 4, 5 – P 2 proposes)  
A strict majority of 4 is 3 votes.  
If P 2 is killed, the division just derived will occur:  
 3 gets 1000, 4 gets 0, 5 gets 0.  
So 4 and 5 each face 0 gold in that continuation.  
P 2 can buy two votes cheaply by giving them 1 apiece:  
 P 2: 998, P 3: 0, P 4: 1, P 5: 1.  
Votes: 2 (Y), 4 (Y), 5 (Y) → 3 yes votes, plan passes.

Stage with 5 pirates (P 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – P 1 proposes)  
A majority of 5 is 3 votes.  
If P 1 is killed, the plan above will be enacted:  
 P 2 gets 998, P 3 gets 0, P 4 gets 1, P 5 gets 1.  

So:  
• P 3 faces 0 gold if 1 dies – offer him 1 and he will vote Yes.  
• P 4 and P 5 face 1 gold if 1 dies. To make either of them vote Yes, 1 must beat that with at least 2 gold (and they will be happy, even though one of them still gets nothing, because only their own vote counts).

Thus P 1 gives 2 gold to exactly one of {4, 5}, 1 gold to 3, and nothing to the rest.

One optimal proposal is  
 P 1: 997, P 2: 0, P 3: 1, P 4: 2, P 5: 0.

Votes: 1 (Y), 3 (Y), 4 (Y) = 3 yes votes out of 5 ⇒ passes.

P 1 cannot keep 998, because every pirate who would receive only 1 under his plan could instead kill him and still get 1 while also enjoying another death, so they would vote No. Hence 997 is the maximum he can guarantee himself.

Final answer: Pirate #1 can keep 997 gold pieces. A winning proposal is  
997 for himself, 0 for pirate #2, 1 for pirate #3, 2 for pirate #4, and 0 for pirate #5.",True

SQ Root of 25 = 5",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. Decide what “+” is supposed to mean.  
   • In ordinary arithmetic “+” means scalar addition, and 3 + 4 is of course 7.  
   • But in many everyday situations we use the word “add” (or the symbol “+”) to mean “do one displacement and then another.”  That is vector addition.

2. Describe the particular displacements.  
   • Let the first displacement be 3 units due east.  Represent it by the vector (3, 0).  
   • Let the second displacement be 4 units due north.  Represent it by the vector (0, 4).

3. Perform the vector addition.  
   (3, 0) + (0, 4) = (3, 4).  
   So after the two moves you are at the point (3, 4).

4. Ask for the single straight-line distance from the start to that point.  
   By the Pythagorean theorem the length of (3, 4) is  
   √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.

5. Interpret the result.  
   The two moves “3 + 4’’ have the same overall effect as one 5-unit move.  In that sense 3 + 4 = 5.

6. Summarize.  
   The equality is possible because we were not using the ordinary scalar addition of numbers; we were using vector addition followed by taking the Euclidean norm (length).  In that context the famous 3-4-5 right triangle makes “3 plus 4 equals 5’’ perfectly true.

Final answer: It is possible when “+” represents adding perpendicular displacements (vector addition); a 3-unit move in one direction followed by a 4-unit move at right angles leaves you 5 units from your start, so 3 + 4 = 5 in that geometric sense.",True

6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?","Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.

1.  The six digits 1 2 3 4 5 6 tell us which letter may occupy each position:  
   • 1 → O / U / D / B  
   • 2 → S / K / Q / T  
   • 3 → I / H / E / N  
   • 4 → O / I / F / W  
   • 5 → Z / U / Y / S  
   • 6 → I / L / E / C  

2.  We need two ordinary English words, each six letters long, whose letters obey the corresponding choices above and whose meanings are opposite.

3.  Try starting with one of the four possible first letters (O, U, D, B) and a second letter from {S, K, Q, T}.  
    The combination O T … quickly suggests the uncommon word OTIOSE (“idle; useless”).  
    Check each letter against the chart:  
       O (1) – allowed,  
       T (2) – allowed,  
       I (3) – allowed,  
       O (4) – allowed,  
       S (5) – allowed,  
       E (6) – allowed.  
    So OTIOSE fits perfectly.

4.  An antonym for OTIOSE is USEFUL, which also has six letters.  Test it:  
       U (1) – allowed,  
       S (2) – allowed,

 D, M, Pi, S = Degas, Monet, Pissarro, Sisley

Facts from the text (re-written algebraically):

1.  T_K = T_P and  x(B,M) = x(P,M).  
2.  x(G,Pi) ≥1 ; x(N,D) = x(N,S) = 0.  
3.  S_total = D_total + T_N.  
4.  “Only one room has three Sisley prints” and “only one room has two Degas prints”;  
  T_P is less than the 3-Sisley room’s total and greater than the 2-Degas room’s total.  
5.  M_total = D_total + T_K ; x(K,M) = x(K,D) = 0.  
6.  x(K,S) = 0 ; x(B,D) = 0.

General conditions:  
 • exactly 18 prints, at least 2 per room; • no artist appears more than 6 times.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Structure forced on the kitchen and parlor  
Because x(K,M)=x(K,D)=x(K,S)=0, every kitchen print is Pissarro, so T_K = x(K,Pi).  
Let k = T_K = T_P (from 1).  k≥2.

Step 2 – Bounding D_total and k  
M_total = D_total + k ≤6 ⇒ k ≤ 6 – D_total. 
S_total = D_total + T_N ≤6 ⇒ D_total ≤ 6 – T_N.  Since T_N ≥2, D_total ≤4.  

Rule 4 says the 2-Degas room has <k prints, so k cannot be 2 (rooms hold at least 2 prints).  
Therefore k ≥3.

Step 3 – Trying possibilities for (D_total , k)

D_total =4 forces k=2 (impossible).  
D_total =3 forces k=3, but then the 2-Degas room would have to be the bedroom (the only room allowed to have <3 prints) yet the bedroom may not contain Degas (rule 6) ⇒ impossible.  
Thus D_total =2.

With D_total =2, k may be 3 or 4, but k=3 again makes the 2-Degas room impossible (it would have to be the dining room which must contain a Pissarro), so k=4.

Summary so far  
 T_K = T_P = 4, K holds 4 Pissarros, and D_total =2.

Step 4 – Counting artist totals when k=4 and D_total =2  
M_total = D_total + k = 6.  

Let T_N = e (e≥2).  Then S_total = D_total + e = 2+e ≤6 ⇒ e ≤4.  
If e =4, the total number of Pissarros becomes too small to satisfy the “≥1 in dining” requirement, so e =2 or 3.

Take e =2 (T_N =2).  Then  
 S_total =4,  P_total = 18 – (D+M+S) = 18 – (2+6+4) = 6.

Step 5 – Laying out room totals  
Totals now fixed:  
 K =4 , P =4 , N =2 , so B + G = 18 –10 =8.  
Because the dining room (G) will be the unique 2-Degas room (rule 4) and must have <4 prints, T_G =3 and T_B =5.

Step 6 – Sisley distribution  
S_total =4 and exactly one room holds 3 Sisleys.  
That must be the bedroom (5 prints).  The fourth Sisley must be somewhere else (not K or N); we’ll put it in the parlor.

Step 7 – Monet distribution  
Let the number of Monet prints in bedroom and parlor be x each (rule 1).  
Total Monet is 6, so 2x + x(N,M) =6.  The den contains only Monet (no room left for Pissarro there because T_N =2), hence x(N,M)=2.  
Therefore x=2.

Step 8 – Completing Pissarro counts  
Current tallies  
 Kitchen  4 Pi  
 Dining   1 Pi (still needs ≥1)  
 Den      0 Pi (all Monet)  
 Total used so far: 5 Pi, but 6 are needed ⇒ one more Pissarro must be in the parlor.

Step 9 – Final room‐by‐room listing

Kitchen (4 prints): 0 D 0 M 4 Pi 0 S  
Parlor  (4 prints): 0 D 2 M 1 Pi 1 S  
Bedroom (5 prints): 0 D 2 M 0 Pi 3 S  
Dining  (3 prints): 2 D 0 M 1 Pi 0 S  
Den     (2 prints): 0 D 2 M 0 Pi 0 S  

Checks  
• 18 prints total, at least 2 per room – yes  
• Artist totals: D=2, M=6, Pi=6, S=4 – all ≤6  
• All six numbered rules are met (verified one-by-one above).

Therefore the arrangement is unique and must be:

Parlor: 2 Monet, 1 Pissarro, 1 Sisley  
Bedroom: 2 Monet, 3 Sisley  
Dining room: 2 Degas, 1 Pissarro

where pᵢ is the digit in position i (positions are 1–10).  
All digits 0–9 are used exactly once and, for digits 1–9, none may sit in their own-numbered position (derangement condition).

1.  p₃ = 0  (given).

2.  p₉ + p₁₀ is a cube ≤ 18.  
    The only such cubes are 1 and 8; 1 would require another 0 (impossible),  
    so p₉ + p₁₀ = 8.

3.  p₅ + p₁₀ is a square different from 9, i.e. 4 or 16 (the only squares ≤ 18 besides 0 and 9).

   Try every way to split 8 into two distinct digits and check which give a workable p₅:

   • (p₉,p₁₀) = (1,7)  →  p₅ + 7 = 4 or 16 ⇒ p₅ = 9 (only 16 works).  
   • (2,6)            →  p₅ + 6 = 4 or 16 ⇒ impossible.  
   • (3,5)            →  p₅ + 5 = 4 or 16 ⇒ impossible.  
   • (5,3)            →  p₅ + 3 = 4 ⇒ p₅ = 1 (works).  
   • (6,2)            →  p₅ + 2 = 4 ⇒ p₅ = 2 (duplicate digit).  
   • (7,1)            →  p₅ + 1 = 4 ⇒ p₅ = 3 (works).

   Hence three viable triples:

        A  p₉=1, p₁₀=7, p₅=9  
        B  p₉=5, p₁₀=3, p₅=1  
        C  p₉=7, p₁₀=1, p₅=3

4.  “8 is two spaces away from 9” means |pos(8) – pos(9)| = 2.  
    “3 is next to the 9 but not the 0” means 3 is adjacent to 9 and not adjacent to 0 (which is at position 3).  
    Work each case:

   Case A: 9 is in position 5.  
           → 8 must be in position 3 or 7; position 3 already holds 0, so position 7 = 8.  
           → 3 must be at position 4 or 6; position 3 already occupied by 0, so either 4 or 6 works.

   Cases B and C put 9 in positions 9 or 10, both adjacent to position 10 or beyond, conflicting with the fixed 0 and with the “3 next to 9” condition.  
   Only Case A survives.

5.  Under Case A we now have

       p₉ 1  
       p₁₀ 7  

   Remaining digits: 2,3,4,5,6.

   The digit 3 must be next to 9, so choose p₆ = 3 (p₄ would leave 3 touching 0).  

6.  Sum constraint: p₄ + p₆ + p₈ < 10.  
    With p₆ = 3 this gives p₄ + p₈ ≤ 6.  
    From the remaining digits {2,4,5,6} the only way is {2,4}.  
    Place them so that no digit sits in its own position: choose p₄ = 2, p₈ = 4.

7.  p₂ must be an even digit not equal to 2 (for derangement).  
    The only even left is 6, so p₂ = 6.  
    The last unused digit, 5, goes to p₁.

95,"This morning, the popular Bay area cable access TV show, ""Morning Melange"", featured six guests (including Francine and Evan). Each guest lives in a different town in the region (including Corte Madera), and each has a different talent or interest that was the focus of his or her segment.

1. The first three guests were, in some order: the person surnamed Ivens, the person from Berkeley and the antique car collector.
2. Damien's segment was sometime before Lautremont's segment.
3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.
10. The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15.","Females are Alice, Cathy and Francine; males are Brandon, Damien and Evan.","6:45, Damien Ivens, Oakland, Beekeeper

7:30, Brandon Jaspersen, Corte Madera, Bungee jumper
7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.

2. Tom's number is smaller than the rightmost sportsman's number.

From clue 4, the red suit's number must be greater than Sam's number, and must be odd. By trial and error, the possible combinations are (3,2), (5,4), (7,3), (7,6).
From clue 1, the square can only be 324 or 576, where 3 or 7 is the red suit's number.
From clue 3, the square must be 576, and 5 is the yellow suit's number and 6 the blue one.
From clue 2, Tom must be the 5 and Jim the 7.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the sportsmen seen from the rear stand Left – Centre – Right.  
Their three numbers, read in this order, must be a three–digit perfect square whose digits are all 2–9 and are different.

Perfect squares between 100 and 999 with distinct digits 2-9 only:
256, 289, 324, 529, 576, 625, 729, 784.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Factorial condition (Sam!, red divides Sam!+1)

Compute (n!+1) for n = 2 … 9 and note the divisors 2-9 that can divide it.

n   n!+1   small divisors

6   721     7
7   5041    –
8   40321   –
9   362881  –

Thus the only possible pairs (Sam’s number, red-suit number) are
(2,3), (3,7), (4,5), (6,7).

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Yellow suit carries an odd number (3,5,7,9).

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Test every square against these two conditions

Square 256  → odd digit 5 ⇒ yellow = 5.  
Sam must be 2, 5 or 6, but none of the (Sam, red) pairs uses 5 or 6 as red, and (2,3) fails because 3 is not a digit.  Impossible.

289  → odd 9 ⇒ yellow = 9.  
No (Sam, red) pair fits digits 2,8,9.  Impossible.

324  → odd 3 ⇒ yellow = 3.  
The only candidate pair is (Sam, red) = (2,3); but 3 is already yellow, so red can’t also be 3.  Impossible.

529  → odd 5 or 9 ⇒ yellow = 5 or 9.  
No (Sam, red) pair fits the digits 5,2,9.  Impossible.

576  → digits 5-7-6, odd digits 5 and 7.  
Yellow cannot be the same digit as red, so try:

•  Sam = 5, red = 7.  Yellow would have to be 5 (Sam) and red 7 (someone else); Tom’s-number-comparison fails.  
•  Sam = 6, red = 7, yellow = 5.  Works (see below).

625, 729, 784  → each fails similarly on (Sam, red) pairs.

Thus only the square 576 can satisfy every condition.

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Fix the arrangement for 576

Number order (left-centre-right) = 5-7-6.

Take the successful case: Sam’s number = 6, red number = 7, yellow number = 5.

Positions and suits
Left   : number 5  → yellow suit (yellow is odd)  
Centre : number 7  → red suit  
Right  : number 6  → blue suit (only colour left)

Persons
– Sam is the right-hand sportsman (number 6).  
– Tom must have a number smaller than the rightmost number 6, so Tom is the left-hand sportsman (number 5).  
– Jim is therefore the centre sportsman (number 7).

Check all clues:
1.  576 = 24² – perfect square ✔  
2.  Tom’s number 5 < rightmost (Sam’s) number 6 ✔  
3.  Yellow suit’s number 5 is odd ✔  
4.  Sam’s number 6 ⇒ 6!+1 = 721, and red number 7 divides 721 ✔

All conditions satisfied and the solution is unique.

Jim stands in the middle wearing the red suit with number 7;  
Sam stands on the right wearing the blue suit with number 6.",True
97,"Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).","Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.

We have to fix beforehand, once and for all, what every person will shout when, after the bands are put on, he/she can look at the other 499 bands but not at his/her own.  
After the rules are fixed nobody may speak or move, so the chosen strategy must work for every possible colouring of the 500 bands.

Step 1 – an upper bound: no strategy can guarantee more than N ⁄ 2 correct guesses.  
Reason:  For every prisoner i consider the two colourings that differ only in i’s own band (all the other 499 bands are the same in the two colourings).  
Because i sees the same picture in those two colourings, i must shout the same colour in both cases; therefore i is right in exactly one of the two colourings and wrong in the other.  
Hence, over the 2^N possible colourings, prisoner i is right in exactly half of them.  
Summing over the 500 prisoners, the average number of correct guesses per colouring is N × ½ = N/2.  
Since the average is N/2, some colouring must give ≤ N/2 correct guesses.  
Therefore it is impossible to guarantee more than N/2 survivors, i.e. more than 250 when N = 500.

Step 2 – a strategy that guarantees N ⁄ 2 = 250 survivors.  
Before the head-bands are put on, partition the 500 prisoners into 250 ordered pairs  
(Pair 1: A₁,B₁), (Pair 2: A₂,B₂), … , (Pair 250: A₂₅₀,B₂₅₀).  
The rule for every pair is agreed in advance:

• person A (the “first’’ of the pair) will shout the colour that he/she sees on B’s head;  
• person B (the “second’’ of the pair) will shout the opposite colour of what he/she sees on A’s head.

Now examine any pair.  There are two possibilities:

(a) A and B wear the same colour (BB or WW).  
    – A sees that colour on B and shouts it, hence A is correct.  
    – B shouts the opposite colour, hence B is wrong.

(b) A and B wear different colours (BW or WB).  
    – A shouts B’s colour (which is not A’s own), so A is wrong.  
    – B shouts the opposite of A’s colour, which equals B’s own colour, so B is correct.

In every pair exactly one person is correct, no matter how the head-bands are actually distributed.  
With 250 pairs this gives 250 correct guesses for every possible colouring.

Step 3 – optimality.  
The upper bound of Step 1 shows that no strategy can do better than 250, while the pairing strategy of Step 2 attains 250.  
Hence 250 is the maximum number of guaranteed survivors.

1. You do not need to know where the heads are, only how many heads there are altogether (128).

2. While blindfolded, separate any 128 pennies from the table and set them aside.  
   • Call that small pile A.  
   • Call the remaining (huge) pile B.

3. Count exactly 128 pennies into pile A by touch; you do not care whether they are heads or tails.

4. Now flip every coin in pile A over once.

Why it works

• Let k be the number of heads that happened to be in pile A before you flipped.  
  – Then pile B originally had 128 − k heads (because the whole table had 128 heads).  

• After you flip every coin in pile A:  
  – Each of the k original heads becomes a tail.  
  – Each of the 128 − k original tails becomes a head.  
  – Therefore pile A now contains 128 − k heads.

• Pile B still contains 128 − k heads (nothing in B was touched).

Thus both piles have exactly the same number of heads, namely 128 − k. You have achieved two subgroups with equal heads without ever seeing the coins.

Final answer: Separate any 128 coins, flip every coin in that group over, and the two groups now contain the same number of heads.",True
104,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

108,"In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.  So in reality he left them all the same thing.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Because the three boys were different ages when their father died, Stu Pidfule did not put the same amount of cash in each child’s inheritance; instead he fixed things so that, if none of the boys touched the money and it was allowed to grow at a fixed, reasonable rate of interest, each of the three funds would be worth exactly the same amount on a pre-chosen “target” birthday – say, each boy’s 25th birthday.  

Example (assume 5 % compound interest and a $100 000 target value at age 25):

• Derek is already 24.  
  Present value needed = 100 000 / (1.05)¹ ≈ $95 238.  

• Eric is 20.  
  Present value needed = 100 000 / (1.05)⁵ ≈ $78 350.  

• Monkeyboy is 15.  
  Present value needed = 100 000 / (1.05)¹⁰ ≈ $61 391.  

So the father’s will puts $95 238 in Derek’s trust, $78 350 in Eric’s, and $61 391 in Monkeyboy’s.  
The three amounts are different today, yet—if all three boys simply leave the money alone—each one will have the same $100 000 on his 25th birthday. In this sense Stu treated them exactly equally even though the immediate cash amounts were different.

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.	Pay–offs  
 Dog  
  • Survives = 1  
  • Dies      = 0  
  • If it does not eat the flower: expected pay-off = ½·1 + ½·0 = 0.5.  

 Flower  
  • Survives, no poison made = 1  
  • Survives, but had to make poison = 1 – ε  (ε > 0 = small cost of producing poison)  
  • Is eaten                                = 0  

2.	Time line that both agents know is common knowledge  
 a) Before the dog decides, the flower can choose “Poison” or “No-poison”.  
 b) The dog then decides “Eat” or “Don’t-eat”, but cannot see the poison decision.  

3.	What does the flower do?  
 If the dog were certain to eat (probability p = 1), the flower’s choice is  
  Poison  → 1 – ε  
  No-poison → 0  
 Because 1 – ε > 0, it would certainly make poison.  
 In general, for any probability p that the dog will eat, the flower’s expected utility from not poisoning is 1 – p, while poisoning always gives 1 – ε.  
 The flower therefore poisons whenever p > ε; it withholds poison only when the dog’s probability of eating is ≤ ε (an extremely small number).

4.	What does the dog do?  
 The dog knows the rule in step 3.  
 • If it chose Eat with certainty, the flower would foresee p = 1 > ε and would poison; the dog’s pay-off would be 0.  
 • If it chose Don’t-eat, the flower would foresee p = 0 ≤ ε and would not bother to poison; the dog’s pay-off would be 0.5.  
 Because 0.5 > 0, “Don’t-eat” strictly dominates “Eat”.

5.	Equilibrium (perfect Bayesian / sub-game-perfect)  
 Dog’s strategy: Don’t-eat.  
 Flower’s strategy: No-poison (its deterrent never needs to be executed).  
 Neither player has an incentive to deviate:  
  – Given the dog’s strategy, the flower survives with no effort, so it is happy.  
  – Given the flower’s strategy, the dog’s expected survival is 0.5; any attempt to switch to Eat would immediately prompt the flower to change to Poison and would leave the dog with 0.

Therefore the unique rational outcome is that the dog refrains from eating the flower, the flower never actually produces poison, and the dog keeps the original 50 % chance of surviving the virus.

Final answer: The rational dog will not eat the flower, because it foresees that the equally rational flower would certainly poison itself if the dog tried to eat it, leaving the dog worse off than by abstaining.",True

113,"Little Mad Ade, son of Mad Ade, leaves home in the morning to go to school. As he leaves the house he looks at the clock in the mirror. The clock has no number indication and for this reason the boy makes a mistake in interpreting the time (mirror-image). Just assuming the clock must be out of order, the Little Mad Ade cycles to school, where he arrives after twenty minutes. At that moment, the clock at school shows a time that is two and a half hours later than the time that Little Mad Ade saw on the clock at home.
At what time did he reach school?",Think about the difference between the real time and the time of a mirror image. ,"The difference between the real time and the time of the mirror image is two hours and ten minutes (two and a half hours, minus the twenty minutes of cycling). Therefore, the original time on the clock at home that morning could only have been five minutes past seven:
The difference between these clocks is exactly 2 hours and ten minutes (note that also five minutes past one can be mirrored in a similar way, but this is not in the morning!).
Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

t  = the real time (in minutes after 12 : 00) when the boy looked at the clock at home,  
t′ = the time he thought he saw (the mirror reading).  

1. Relation between a time and its mirror image  
For any analogue clock seen in a left-right mirror, every hand is reflected to the opposite side of the dial.  
In terms of angles this sends θ → 360° − θ, which means

 time + mirror-time = 12 h = 720 minutes.  

Hence           t′ = 720 − t.                                        (1)

2. Relation given in the story  
The trip to school lasts 20 minutes, and on arrival the correct school-clock time is 2½ h (=150 min) later than the time he had read at home:

 (t + 20) = (t′ + 150).                                           (2)

3. Solve the two equations  
Insert (1) into (2):

     t + 20 = (720 − t) + 150  
 → 2t = 720 + 130 = 850  
 → t = 425 minutes after 12 : 00.

4. Convert 425 minutes to hours and minutes  

425 min = 7 × 60 + 5 = 7 : 05.

So he left home at 7 : 05.  
He cycled 20 minutes, therefore he arrived at

 7 : 05 + 0 : 20 = 7 : 25.

(Check: the mirror reading was 720 − 425 = 295 min = 4 : 55.  
4 : 55 + 2 h 30 min = 7 : 25, exactly as stated.)

115,"One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?",Think about the letters in each name. ,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reconstruction of the “Untouchable” pattern  

1.  List every participant and count the vowels in the first name  
   (count the usual vowels A,E,I,O,U; ignore Y).  
   • 3 vowels : Candace (a,a,e)  
   • 4 vowels : Elizabeth (e,i,a,e) , Victoria (i,o,i,a)  
   • 5 vowels : Mother Teresa (o,e  +  e,e,a) = 5  
   • 2 vowels : James (a,e) , Saul (a,u) , Moe (o,e) , Pope (o,e) , Gandhi (a,i)  
   • 1 vowel : Larry (a) , Curly (u) , Henry (e)

2.  Detect the rule from the Stooges’ opening moves.  
   • Moe (2 vowels) taps four different people exactly 2 times each – and each of
     those four (James, Saul, Gandhi, Pope) also has 2 vowels.  
   • Larry (1 vowel) taps Henry (1 vowel) and Curly (1 vowel) once each.  
   • Curly (1 vowel) taps Henry (1 vowel) and Larry (1 vowel) once each.  

   So the rule that fits every move is:  
       “A player may tap only people whose names contain the same number of vowels
        as his/her own name, and must tap each of those people exactly that many
        times.”

3.  Check that everyone else follows the same rule.  
   • All of the later taps of James (2 vowels), Saul (2), Henry (1),
     Elizabeth (4) and Victoria (4) obey it perfectly.  
   • Religious figures are forbidden to tap, so the Pope and Gandhi never tap even
     though they could have (they meet the vowel-count condition with 2).  

4.  Determine who can never be tapped.  
   A person is “untouchable” if nobody else shares the same vowel count,
   because then no one is permitted to tap him or her.  
   • 3-vowel count: only Candace → untouchable.  
   • 5-vowel count: only Mother Teresa → untouchable.  

   Every other vowel count (1, 2, 4) is shared by at least two people, and all of
   those people do get tapped.

1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5

And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the three numbers be  

  S = Snap’s number, C = Crackle’s number, P = Pop’s number, with S + C + P = 14.

1. Snap’s remark  
   “I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.”

   If the remainder 14 − S could be split into two equal positive integers, Snap would not be sure that Crackle and Pop differ.  
   14 − S is split equally only when it is even, so 14 − S must be odd for Snap to be certain.  
   Hence S is odd.

2. Crackle’s remark  
   “I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.”

   Crackle knew this even before hearing that S is odd.  
   (i) For either of the others to equal C we would need 14 − 2C > 0, i.e. C ≤ 6.  
       Therefore C ≥ 7.  
   (ii) For Snap and Pop to be able to match each other we would need 14 − C even.  
       Hence C must be odd.  

   Consequently C ∈ {7, 9, 11}.

3. List the triples that meet what everyone now knows  
   S is odd, C ∈ {7,9,11}, all numbers different, and sum is 14.

        C = 7 : (S,P) = (1,6), (3,4), (5,2)  
        C = 9 : (S,P) = (1,4), (3,2)  
        C =11 : (S,P) = (1,2)

4. Pop’s remark  
   “Now I know what all three of our numbers are.”

   Pop sees P.  Which P occurs in only one of the above triples?

        P = 2  appears in three triples        → not unique  
        P = 4  appears in two triples         → not unique  
        P = 6  appears in exactly one triple  → unique

   Therefore P = 6, and the only compatible triple is (S,C,P) = (1,7,6).

5. Gretchen’s deduction  
   From the dialogue she reasons exactly as above: Pop could have identified the numbers only if his own number were 6; that forces the unique solution (1,7,6).  Hence she can state the contents of all three envelopes.

Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Because a saw that has been working keeps turning for a while and stays hot for quite a time, the brother can give every switch a different “history” before he re-enters the room and then recognise that history from the condition of the four machines.

Inside, all four machines are running.  
He goes outside and does the following with the four backup switches.

1. Switch A: turn it OFF and leave it OFF. (This machine will have the longest time to cool.)  
2. Wait about 10 minutes.  
3. Switch B: turn it OFF and leave it OFF. (This one will have a shorter cooling time.)  
4. Wait about 1 minute.  
5. Switch C: turn it OFF and at once walk to the door. (Its saw will still be coasting when he gets inside.)  
6. Switch D: do not touch it at all; leave it ON. (Its machine keeps running.)

Now he re-enters the sawing room.

• One machine is still running – that is the one fed by switch D (the switch he never touched).  
• One machine has just stopped and the blade is still spinning down – that is the one fed by switch C (the switch he threw last).  
• Of the two silent machines, one motor housing is still noticeably warm while the other is already cool.  
  – the warm one corresponds to switch B (turned off 1 minute earlier);  
  – the cool one corresponds to switch A (turned off 11 minutes earlier).

Thus each machine is in a different, unmistakable state, letting the brother match every outside switch with its machine inside the room without ever seeing the machines while he is operating the switches.

Final answer: By turning the four outside switches OFF at four different times (leaving one on), then immediately going back inside and judging which machine is still running, which has a coasting blade, which is warm, and which is cold, the brother can identify which outside switch controls which saw.",True
124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second. The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We label the six faces  
T = top, B = bottom, F = front, Ba = back, L = left, R = right.

Steps that can be performed (in some order)  
a) paint whole cube red  
b) paint a white circle on F, B, L, R  
c) paint F and Ba black  
d) paint T, Ba and B blue  

Mixing rules and special rules  
• red+blue = purple, red+white = pink, blue+white = light blue, black+white = gray, blue+black = dark-blue, red+black = maroon  
• After black is put on a face that face can never again be changed; the mixing that occurs happens at the instant the black paint is applied.  
• Once two colours have mixed the resulting colour can never change.  

Required final appearance  
T : all purple  
L,R : red with a pink circle  
F : black with a gray circle  
B : purple with a light-blue circle  
Ba : all dark-blue  

--------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step deduction

1.  Back must finish dark-blue (blue+black).  
   Therefore blue must already be on the back when black is applied; hence step d (blue) must occur before step c (black).

2.  Front must finish black with a gray (black+white) circle and, crucially, the background must NOT be maroon (black+red).  
   Hence red cannot be on the front when black is applied.  
   So step a (red) has to be after step c (black).

   Present order so far:  d  →  c  →  a  
   (blue)   (black) (red)

3.  The left and right faces need a pink (red+white) circle on a red background.  
   Easiest way: first put on the white circles, then later cover the whole cube with red.  
   That forces step b (white circles) to occur before step a (red).  

   Present order:  b  →  d  →  c  →  a

4.  Verify that this order creates exactly the desired colours:

   • After b: white circles on F,B,L,R.  
   • After d:  
     – T blue, Ba blue, B blue (light-blue circle appears on B because blue lands on the earlier white circle).  
   • After c:  
     – F and Ba painted black.  
       · On F it lands on a white circle ⇒ gray circle, black background.  
       · On Ba it lands on blue ⇒ dark-blue (whole face).  
   • After a:  
     – Red over every face except those now “frozen” by black/dark-blue.  
       · T blue + red ⇒ purple.  
       · B blue background + red ⇒ purple background; light-blue circle is already a mixed colour so it stays.  
       · L,R receive red over base, red mixes with earlier white circles ⇒ pink circles, red backgrounds.  
       · F (black/gray) and Ba (dark-blue) unchanged (black cannot be altered).  

   Every face now matches the required final description.

5.  Check the meta-condition (exactly one of the four statements is true):  
   – “Black was added first”  → false (black third).  
   – “Red was added before blue”  → false (red last).  
   – “Blue was added after white” → true (blue second, white first).  
   – “White was added last” → false.  
   Exactly one true – condition satisfied.

Hence the only possible sequence is:

Step 1: b) white circles  
Step 2: d) blue on top, back, bottom  
Step 3: c) black on front and back  
Step 4: a) whole cube red

Colours were added in the order: White → Blue → Black → Red.

Final answer:  b, d, c, a  (White, then Blue, then Black, then Red).",True
125,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.

126,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

128,"One variation of the famous ""Eight Queens Puzzle"" is the ""Bishop Puzzle"".
We know that you can place up to 8 queens on a chessboard with no other pieces in such a fashion that no queen can be taken.  We also know that you can place 32 knights on the board in such a fashion that none can be taken.
Do you know how many bishops you can place on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no piece can be taken?  What is their placement?",Take advantage of the fact that bishops can't move like rooks!,"Fourteen bishops can be placed on the board.
There are a number of solutions for this problem, but the simplest is the following placement.

4) e8
5) f8
6) g8
7) a1
8) b1
9) c1
10) d1
11) e1
12) f1
13) g1
14) h1",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning  

1.  How many can there be at most?  
   •  A bishop attacks every square on the two diagonals that cross its own square.  
   •  On an 8×8 board there are 15 diagonals running north-east/south-west (their
     “sum” r+c equals 2,3,…,16) and 15 running north-west/south-east
     (their “difference” r–c equals –7,…,7).  
   •  In a non-attacking set every bishop must stand on a different “sum’’
     diagonal and also on a different “difference’’ diagonal.  
   •  Suppose 15 bishops (the next integer after 14) could be placed.
     Then every one of the 15 sum–diagonals would have to contain
     exactly one bishop.  
     In particular the diagonals r+c=2 and r+c=16 would both be occupied.
     These two diagonals consist of the corner squares (1,1) and (8,8)
     respectively, so two bishops would have to stand on those two
     squares.  But both corners lie on the same difference–diagonal
     r−c =0, so the two bishops would attack each other – a contradiction.
     Hence 15 bishops are impossible and the theoretical upper bound is
     14 (=2·8–2).  

2.  Showing that 14 really are possible.  
    Place bishops on every square of the first rank except h1
    and on every square of the eighth rank except h8, i.e. on  

        a1  b1  c1  d1  e1  f1  g1  
        a8  b8  c8  d8  e8  f8  g8  

    (or in coordinates (1,1)…(1,7) and (8,1)…(8,7)).  

    Check:  
      – Their r−c values are
        0,−1,−2,−3,−4,−5,−6, 7,6,5,4,3,2,1 – all different.  
      – Their r+c values are
        2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 – all different.  

    Because no two bishops share either kind of diagonal, none can capture
    another.  

3.  Conclusion  
    The largest possible number of mutually non-attacking bishops on an
    8×8 chessboard is 14, and one explicit maximal arrangement is the
    fourteen squares listed above.

129,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four weights (in ounces) be  
w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .  
We are using a two–pan balance, so a weight may be placed on the same side as the gold dust (to “subtract”) or on the opposite side (to “add”).  
A weight of x ounces can therefore produce a net effect of −x, 0, or +x ounces.

Goal  
We want to be able to weigh every whole number of ounces from 1 up to some largest value N.  
We want N as large as possible.

Step 1.  The first weight must be 1 ounce.  
Otherwise 1 oz could not be weighed at all.  
So w₁ = 1.

Step 2.  How large may w₂ be?  
Suppose the sum of all lighter weights is S.  
With the balance we can produce any integer from −S to +S.  
If the next weight w is larger than 2S+1, then the amount S+1 cannot be formed:  
the new weight w is too heavy to go on the same pan as the gold (it would overshoot),
and if we put it on the opposite pan the light weights sum to at most S, leaving a gap of at least 1 ounce.

Therefore, to keep all amounts attainable, the necessary and sufficient condition is  
w ≤ 2S + 1.

To maximize N we take w as large as allowed: w = 2S + 1.

Step 3.  Apply this rule successively.

• After w₁ = 1 we have S = 1 → w₂ = 2·1 + 1 = 3.

• Now S = 1 + 3 = 4 → w₃ = 2·4 + 1 = 9.

• Now S = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 → w₄ = 2·13 + 1 = 27.

Thus the four weights must be 1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, and 27 oz.

Step 4.  Largest weighable amount.  
The greatest positive net weight obtainable is the sum of all four weights:

1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 ounces.

Because the weights satisfy the condition w_k ≤ 2(sum of previous) + 1, every integer from 1 up to this sum can indeed be represented (this is exactly the balanced–ternary system).

Hence the assessor can measure every whole number of ounces from 1 through 40, and 40 is the absolute maximum attainable with only four weights.

Final answer: 40",True
130,"Five young ladies (Liz, Marge, Sam, Ella and Jenny) went on five different hiking adventures. Each walked a distance of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 kilometers (random order). Each were able to take an extraordinary wildlife photograph in different locations (forest, meadow, mountain, river side and bushes) of different animals (rabbit, bird, deer, fox and bear cubs).  From the clues below determine where and of what each girl took a photograph of, and the distance each travelled.
1.  Liz walked twice as far as the girl who saw the deer.  The girl who got a shot of the fox travelled one kilometer less than Jenny.  The girl in the bushes was not the one who walked 5 kilometers.  The girl on the riverside walked either one kilometer more or less than the one who was in the bushes.

132,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?","If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129","If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8
5+7
Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.
Thus the only remaining solution is: houses 4 and 8.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the ten house numbers be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  
Suppose the two houses that never receive mail are a and b.

1.  Counts of deliveries  
   • Each working day the postman visits 4 different houses.  
   • He works 6 days, so total deliveries = 6×4 = 24.  
   • The eight houses that are served each get mail 3 times, so deliveries = 8×3 = 24.  
   Thus everything is consistent.

2.  Using the daily sums  
   The total of all numbers delivered through the week is  
   18 + 12 + 23 + 19 + 32 + 25 = 129.  
   Each of the eight served houses appears exactly 3 times, so  
      3 × (sum of the eight served house-numbers) = 129  
      ⇒ sum of the eight served houses = 43.  
   But the sum of all ten house numbers is 1+2+…+10 = 55, so  
      a + b = 55 − 43 = 12.

   Pairs of distinct numbers in {1,…,10} whose sum is 12 are  
      (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7).

3.  Eliminate impossible pairs with the 32-sum for Friday  
   • If (2,10) were missing, the largest available numbers would be 1–9; the greatest possible daily sum would be 9+8+7+6 = 30 < 32.  Impossible.  
   • If (3,9) were missing, the largest available numbers would be 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10; the greatest daily sum would be 10+8+7+6 = 31 < 32.  Impossible.  
   • If (5,7) were missing, the available numbers are 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10.  A check shows that no combination of four distinct numbers from this set totals 32.  Impossible.

   The only remaining possibility is that 4 and 8 are never served.

4.  Constructing an explicit schedule (to show it really works)  
   With houses 4 and 8 omitted, the eight houses {1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10} must each be used exactly three times.  
   One valid arrangement is:

   Monday      10  5  2  1   (sum 18)  
   Tuesday      1  2  3  6   (sum 12)  
   Wednesday   10  7  5  1   (sum 23)  
   Thursday     9  5  3  2   (sum 19)  
   Friday      10  9  7  6   (sum 32)  
   Saturday     9  7  6  3   (sum 25)

   Each of the eight houses appears exactly three times, all daily sums are correct, and houses 4 and 8 never appear.

Therefore the only possible pair of houses that received no mail is 4 and 8.

1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?","From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then suppose Heather was not at the park. Find some contradiction.","Heather's brother was murdered.
From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then, from fact 1, Heather's husband and their daughter were at the store, their son was at home, and Heather and her brother were at the park, which means that one of Heather and her brother must have killed the other. But, from fact 3, this cannot work, which means that Heather was at the store.
Suppose the man at the store with Heather was her brother. Then her husband was at the park with one of the two children. Since the husband is obviously older than the children, fact 4 tells us that he could not have killed them. But since he doesn't have a sibling who lives with him, fact 3 tells us he can't be the victim either.
This means that Heather and her son were at the store, her daughter was at home, and Heather's husband and brother were at the park. Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

H = Heather (adult woman)  
M = Heather’s husband (adult man)  
B = Heather’s brother (adult man)  
S = their son (boy)  
D = their daughter (girl)  

Facts to translate

(1) Exactly three non-overlapping groups existed at the time:  
 • a man and a woman at the store,  
 • the murderer + the victim at the park,  
 • one of the two children home alone.

(2) Heather and her husband were not together.

(3) The victim’s sibling is not the murderer.

(4) The murderer is younger than the victim.

Step 1 – Who can be at the store?  
The “woman” at the store must be an adult woman.  The only adult woman is Heather, so Heather was at the store.  
Because the pair is “a man and a woman,” the man at the store must also be an adult; a boy would be called a “boy,” not a “man.”  
Hence the man with Heather is B, her brother.  
Therefore the store pair is {H, B}.

Step 2 – Where are the others?  
The remaining three people are M, S, D.  
• One child is home alone.  
• The other two people (the murderer and the victim) are together in the park.

Step 3 – Identify the murderer–victim pair.  
Since both children are not in the same place, at most one child can be at the park.  
Heather’s husband M is not at the store and cannot be home (only a child is home), so M must be at the park.  
Thus M is either the murderer or the victim.

But the other member of the park pair must be the remaining child (S or D), because H and B are already at the store.  
Therefore the murderer is a child and the other child is the one home alone.

Step 4 – Use the age and sibling conditions.  
• The child is younger than M, so condition (4) (murderer younger than victim) forces M to be the victim and the child to be the murderer.  
• Condition (3) is automatically satisfied, because M has no sibling in this group.

Everything now fits all four facts:

Store : Heather (woman) and her brother (man)  
Park : Heather’s husband M (victim) and one of the children (murderer)  
Home : the other child, alone  

Hence the only person who can possibly be the victim is Heather’s husband.

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""

140,"8 friends decided to play in a pool tournament.  They played a single elimination tournament, with three rounds (the first round, second round, and finals).  Using the clues below can you determine who beat whom in each round?
Boys:  Jack, Jamie, Jim, Roger, Tommy
Girls:  Jessica, Renee, Tina
Clues:
1.  No one ever played against someone else with the same first name initial.
2.  The four people who advanced to the second round were Renee, the person who beat Tina in the first round, the loser of the final match, and the man who played Jessica in the first round.
3.  3 games of the first round, and 1 game of the second round were played by two people of the opposite sex.
4.  Jack only played against a man one time in the tournament, and Roger played against a man in every round he played in.
5.  Renee played against Jack at some point in the tournament.
6.  The two people who played in the final round were the winner, and the man who beat Tommy in the 2nd round.
7.  Jim always played against a man in the tournament.
8.  Jessica did not play against the eventual champion.","There are four people with firt names ""J""","First Round:
Jack vs. Tina, Jack won
Jamie vs. Renee, Renee won
Jessica vs. Tommy, Tommy won
Jim vs. Roger, Roger won
Second Round:
Jack vs. Renee, Jack won
Tommy vs. Roger, Roger won
Finals:
Jack vs. Roger, Jack won",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1.  “No one ever played someone with the same first–letter”  
   Because four of the eight names start with J, no J-player can ever face another J-player.

2.  “Three of the four first-round games were mixed-sex; only one was same-sex.”  
   With three women in the tourney that forces every woman to meet a man in the first round and leaves one all-male game.

3.  Jim “always played a man,” so Jim must be in that all-male first-round game.

4.  Roger “played a man in every round he played,” so Roger must be the other player in that same all-male first-round game – Roger vs Jim is the unique MM game of round 1.

5.  Therefore the other three first-round games are M-vs-F:
        – a man vs Tina  
        – a man vs Jessica  
        – a man vs Renee

6.  Clue 2 names the four semifinalists and says they are all different:
        Renee;  
        the person who beat Tina;  
        the man who played Jessica;  
        the eventual final loser.  
   Hence the three men in the semifinals are all distinct, so the four semifinalists are 1 woman + 3 men.

7.  Round 2 contained exactly one mixed-sex game (clue 3).  
   Because only one woman (Renee) is still alive, the mixed semifinal must be Renee vs a man; the other semifinal is man vs man.

8.  Tommy is singled out in clue 6: he loses in the semifinals to a man who then reaches the final and loses there.  
   Therefore Tommy is a semifinalist but not the final loser; he must be “the man who played Jessica” in round 1 (otherwise there would be two different men defeating women who are already allocated).  
   So first-round game: Tommy beats Jessica.

9.  To keep first-initials different, Tina’s opponent cannot be Tommy, so she must face either Jack, Jamie or Jim/Roger (but Jim and Roger are already matched).  
   We shall see that Jack must be her opponent (step 12).

10. Jack “played a man only once.”  
    Since he plays a woman in round 1, he has to reach at least the semifinals (so he will meet one man) and, if he reaches the final, that final opponent must not be a second man.  The only way is:  
        – round 1 vs woman  
        – round 2 vs woman  
        – final vs man (his lone male opponent).

11.  Renee “played Jack at some point,” so the mixed semifinal game is Jack vs Renee (Jack’s second straight game versus a woman).

12.  That makes Jack the only candidate left to have beaten Tina in round 1, so first-round game: Jack beats Tina.

13.  The remaining woman, Renee, must have beaten Jamie in round 1 (the last mixed game).

14.  Summarising quarter-finals
        Jack  def. Tina  
        Tommy def. Jessica  
        Roger def. Jim  
        Renee def. Jamie

15.  Semifinals  
        Jack   def. Renee   (mixed)  
        Roger  def. Tommy   (man vs man)

    • Roger fits “played a man every round.”  
    • Roger, having just beaten Tommy, is exactly “the man who beat Tommy in the 2nd round” of clue 6.

16.  Final  
        Jack  (champion)  def.  Roger  (final loser)

    Jack now has faced exactly one man (Roger), satisfying clue 4.  
    Jessica never played Jack (clue 8).  
    All initial-duplicate pairings were avoided.

All clues are satisfied, so the complete result is:

Quarter-finals  
– Jack beat Tina.  
– Tommy beat Jessica.  
– Roger beat Jim.  
– Renee beat Jamie.  

Semi-finals  
– Jack beat Renee.  
– Roger beat Tommy.  

Final  
– Jack beat Roger and won the tournament.  

Final answer:  
Round 1: Jack > Tina, Tommy > Jessica, Roger > Jim, Renee > Jamie  
Round 2 (semifinals): Jack > Renee, Roger > Tommy  
Final: Jack > Roger (Jack is the champion)",True

Write the letters contained in each of the given words (ignore order, repeats don’t matter here):

MAGIC  → {M A G I C}  
YEARN  → {Y E A R N}  
BLAME  → {B L A M E}  
GRABS  → {G R A B S}  
KARMA  → {K A R M}  
BREAK  → {B R E A K}

Because the letter A is present in every one of these sets, the easiest way to reach the required
“shares 2 letters” (or 3 for BREAK) is to put A inside the secret word.  
With A already counted once in every intersection we still need:

MAGIC : one more of {M,G,I,C}  
YEARN : one more of {Y,E,R,N}  
BLAME : one more of {B,L,M,E}  
GRABS : one more of {G,R,B,S}  
KARMA : one more of {K,R,M}  
BREAK : two more of {B,R,E,K}

Observations that make all the conditions coexist:

• If we take the letter R we would instantly satisfy YEARN, GRABS and KARMA at the same time,   
  but then we could not add the extra letter the word BREAK needs without
  exceeding 2 in one of those sets, so R must be avoided.  

• Choose B and K to supply the two extra letters that BREAK needs.  
  – B gives the single extra letter needed by BLAME and by GRABS.  
  – K gives the single extra letter needed by KARMA.  

• Now MAGIC still needs one extra letter that is not B or K.  
  Pick C (from MAGIC) – it does not belong to any other still-sensitive set.  

• YEARN still needs one extra letter that is not already present in another set.  
  Pick Y.  

So far we have gathered the five letters A  B  C  K  Y.

MAGIC : A, C → 2 letters shared  
YEARN : A, Y → 2 letters shared  
BLAME : A, B → 2 letters shared  
GRABS : A, B → 2 letters shared  
KARMA : A, K → 2 letters shared

Work from the units place upward, keeping track of carries.

1. Units (10⁰ place)  
 f(a) − e ≡ 3 (mod 10).

 The possibilities are (a,e) = (1,8) or (6,6).  
 If (a,e)=(1,8) there is a carry k₁=1 (because 8+3=11);  
 if (a,e)=(6,6) there is no carry (k₁=0).

2. Tens (10¹ place)  
 f(b) − d ≡ 3 + k₁ (mod 10).

 With k₁=1 (coming from a=1,e=8) the only workable pair is (b,d)=(0,6)
 which produces an extra carry k₂=1.  
 With k₁=0 no admissible pair exists.  
 Hence we must have a=1, e=8, b=0, d=6, k₁=1, k₂=1.

3. Hundreds (10² place)  
 f(c) − c ≡ 6 + k₂ = 7 (mod 10).

 Scanning the digit set, the sole solution is c=9, giving f(c)=6
 and another carry k₃=1 (because 9+7=16).

4. Thousands (10³ place)  
 f(d) − b ≡ 8 + k₃ = 9 (mod 10) with d=6, b=0.

 Indeed f(d)=9 and 9−0≡9 (no new carry k₄=0).

5. Ten-thousands (10⁴ place)  
 f(e) − a ≡ 7 + k₄ = 7 (mod 10) with e=8, a=1.

 f(e)=8 and 8−1=7, consistent and producing no carry beyond 10⁴,
 so both N and Nʹ remain five-digit numbers.

Thus the only set of digits satisfying every place value is

a=1, b=0, c=9, d=6, e=8.

Therefore

Step 1:  Show H cannot be a multiple of 3  
• If H were a multiple of 3, Statement 1 forces H into 50–59.  
• To satisfy Statement 2, such an H would have to be a multiple of 4 (otherwise it must lie in 60–69).

148,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.
And that's that. We have covered all possibilities.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Number the coins 1-12.  
All three weighings are fixed in advance except that after each weighing we are told which pan is heavier (or that the pans balance) and we use that information to decide what to do next.

WEIGHING 1  

Put 1,2,3,4 in the left pan and 5,6,7,8 in the right pan.

There are three possibilities.

────────────────────────────────────────  
CASE A – The pans balance  
────────────────────────────────────────  

The false coin is one of 9,10,11,12.

WEIGHING 2  
Put 9,10,11 in the right pan and three known good coins (1,2,3) in the left pan.

• If the pans balance, the only suspect left is 12.  

  WEIGHING 3 Weigh 12 against any good coin (say 1).  
  Heavier ⇒ 12 is heavy, lighter ⇒ 12 is light.

• If the right pan is heavier, the false coin is light among 9,10,11.  

  WEIGHING 3 Weigh 9 against 10.  
  If they balance ⇒ 11 is the light coin.  
  If not ⇒ the lighter of 9 or 10 is the false (light) coin.

• If the right pan is lighter, the false coin is heavy among 9,10,11.  

  WEIGHING 3 Weigh 9 against 10.  
  If they balance ⇒ 11 is the heavy coin.  
  If not ⇒ the heavier of 9 or 10 is the false (heavy) coin.

────────────────────────────────────────  
CASE B – Left pan heavier (1,2,3,4 heavier than 5,6,7,8)  
────────────────────────────────────────  

Either a coin in {1,2,3,4} is heavy OR a coin in {5,6,7,8} is light.

WEIGHING 2  
Put 1,2,5 in the left pan and 3,6,9 in the right pan  
(coin 9 is known good because it was not on the scale in the first weighing).

Again three possibilities:

B1  The pans balance.  
 Then 1,2,3,5,6 are genuine.  
 Possible false coins: 4 (heavy) or 7,8 (light).

 WEIGHING 3 Weigh 7 against 8.  
 If they balance ⇒ 4 is the heavy false coin.  
 Otherwise the lighter of 7 or 8 is the false coin.

B2  Left pan heavier (same way as in weighing 1).  
 Possible false coins: 1 (heavy), 2 (heavy), 6 (light).

 WEIGHING 3 Weigh 1 against 2.  
 If they balance ⇒ 6 is the light false coin.  
 Otherwise the heavier of 1 or 2 is the false coin.

B3  Right pan heavier (opposite way to weighing 1).  
 Possible false coins: 3 (heavy) or 5 (light).

 WEIGHING 3 Weigh 3 against 9.  
 If they balance ⇒ 5 is the light false coin.  
 Otherwise 3 is the heavy false coin.

────────────────────────────────────────  
CASE C – Right pan heavier (mirror image of Case B)  
────────────────────────────────────────  

The reasoning is the mirror of Case B, exchanging “left” and “right”, “heavy” and “light”, and coins {1,2,3,4} with {5,6,7,8}.  
We obtain, symmetrically:

C1  If second weighing balances → suspects 8 (heavy) or 3,4 (light).  
 Weigh 3 against 4 to finish.

C2  If second weighing again shows right pan heavier → suspects 5 (heavy) or 1 (light) or 2 (light).  
 Weigh 1 against 2 to finish.

C3  If second weighing now makes the left pan heavier → suspects 7 (heavy) or 6 (light).  
 Weigh 7 against 9 to finish.

────────────────────────────────────────  

In every one of the three main cases, the third weighing singles out exactly one coin and tells whether it is heavier or lighter.  Thus the false coin and its nature (heavy or light) are always found in only three weighings.

149,"Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:
Room A: small, borders rooms B and E
Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter
In either scenario, the mother's and the sister's rooms are the same size. And from fact 2, the sister is the lead.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"(One rigorous way to see that only Hans’s sister can be the lead.)

1.  Because there are only two men (Hans and his son) and every room must
    border a man’s room (Fact 4), at least one of the two men must be in the
    “central” room B, the only room that borders all the others.  
    Also, the two men’s rooms must be adjacent (so that a man’s room borders
    a man’s room).

2.  Room B is the unique room that borders 4 rooms.  
    By Fact 1 the lead’s room and the sibling’s room must border the same
    number of rooms, so neither the lead nor the sibling can be in B (otherwise
    the other one would also have to be in B, which is impossible).

    Hence the lead–sibling pair must occupy
        • the two 2-neighbour rooms A and C, or  
        • the two 3-neighbour rooms D and E.

3.  Test each possible lead.

    a)  Hans as lead  
        (sibling = sister, parent = mother).  
        A systematic check of the two neighbourhood-count options shows that
        either Hans’s room touches his daughter’s (violating Fact 3) or some
        room borders only women (violating Fact 4).  Impossible.

    b)  Son as lead  
        (sibling = daughter, parent = Hans).  
        Whichever way the rooms A/C or D/E are assigned, Hans’s room always
        ends up touching his daughter’s (violating Fact 3).  Impossible.

    c)  Daughter as lead  
        (sibling = son, parent = Hans).  
        Every attempt again leaves some room with neighbours of only one sex,
        or makes Hans’s room touch his daughter’s.  Impossible.

    d)  Mother as lead  
        Mother has no sibling in the cast, so Fact 1 cannot be satisfied.
        Impossible.

    e)  Sister as lead  
        (sibling = Hans, parent = mother).  
        Put the lead–sibling pair in the 2-neighbour rooms:

             A  –  Sister (F)        (small, 2 neighbours)  
             C  –  Hans   (M)        (large, 2 neighbours)

        To make the sister’s room the same size as her parent’s (Fact 2), put

             D  –  Mother (F)        (small)

        The remaining rooms are

             B  –  Son     (M)       (large)  
             E  –  Daughter(F)       (large)

        Check all facts:

        • Neighbour counts: rooms A and C each border 2 rooms  →  Fact 1 OK.  
        • Sizes: rooms A and D are both small                   →  Fact 2 OK.  
        • Hans’s room C borders B and D, not E (daughter’s room) → Fact 3 OK.  
        • Each room borders at least one man and one woman:

              A borders B(M) and E(F)  
              B borders A(F), C(M), D(F), E(F)  
              C borders B(M) and D(F)  
              D borders B(M), C(M), E(F)  
              E borders A(F), B(M), D(F)                     →  Fact 4 OK.

        All four facts are satisfied.

4.  Since no other person can satisfy all the facts, the only possible lead
    actor is Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr.’s sister.

150,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning  

1.  Define the position (n) = “there are n lions and 1 sheep on the island”.  
    • Whenever a lion eats the sheep he disappears as a lion and re-appears as a sheep.  
      So after such a meal the number of lions drops by 1 while the number of sheep stays 1.  

2.  We determine, for every n, whether a lion will eat or not.  
    The animals are perfectly logical: a lion will eat the sheep iff he can be certain he will
    never be eaten later.  Otherwise he will keep eating grass.

3.  Base cases.  
    n = 1.  If the single lion eats, he becomes a sheep and there are now 0 lions.  
            No one can harm him, so he is safe.  ⇒ He eats. (Sheep is eaten.)  

    n = 2.  If one of the two lions eats, he becomes a sheep and 1 lion remains.  
            A “1-lion” position is known (just above) to be lethal for the sheep,
            so the new sheep will certainly be eaten.  
            Therefore no lion is willing to eat in the first place.  ⇒ Nobody eats.  
            (Original sheep survives.)  

4.  Induction step.  Assume we already know the rule for every number ≤ n.  
    Consider position n+1.

    • Suppose a lion contemplates eating.  After the bite the game moves to position n.  
    • If in position n the sheep is safe, then the transformed lion would be safe
      (so eating is attractive).  
    • If in position n the sheep gets eaten, then the transformed lion would die
      (so eating is unattractive).  

    Hence:
        – If the sheep is safe with n lions, one of the n+1 lions will eat.  
        – If the sheep is doomed with n lions, none of the n+1 lions will eat.  

5.  Putting 3 and 4 together we obtain the pattern

          n = 1   2   3   4   5   6   …
          fate  E   S   E   S   E   S   …

    where E = sheep is Eaten, S = sheep Survives.  
    Thus the sheep is eaten exactly when n is odd, and survives when n is even.

6.  Initial situation: n = 100 (even).  
    By the rule above, no lion will risk eating, because the moment any lion did so
    the island would move to “99 lions”, an odd number in which the new sheep must be eaten.
    That prospect deters every lion in the original position.

Final answer: The sheep will not be eaten; with 100 lions (an even number) every lion refuses to attack, so the sheep lives forever.",True

• M O N O  →  MONO

153,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).",Induction,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated.

Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"30 people came forward.

Reasoning in full:

1. Let N be the number of nominated villagers.  
   Every nominated villager can see all the other N − 1 nominees, but (like everyone else) cannot see whether he himself is nominated.

2. Base case N = 1  
   The single nominee sees no one nominated.  
   Because everyone was told that “at least one person is nominated”, he immediately realises that it must be himself.  
   He would therefore come to the hall the first night.

3. Inductive step  
   Assume that if exactly k nominees exist, they all appear on the k-th night.  
   Now suppose there are k + 1 nominees.  
   Each of these k + 1 people sees k others wearing the “nominee status”.  
   They first reason: “If I myself were not nominated, there would only be k nominees in total, so those k people would all appear on night k (by the induction hypothesis).”  
   When night k passes and nobody appears, each of the k + 1 nominees realises that the case “I am not nominated” is impossible.  
   Therefore each concludes he must also be nominated, and all k + 1 appear together the next night, i.e. on night k + 1.

4. By mathematical induction, if N people are nominated, they will all step forward on night N.

5. In the story no one came forward until the 30-th night, when “a certain number of people came forward and they were all right”.

Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice.

• “As we eat, our justice is served” – the diners sit down only after the sentence has been carried out; the bodies are already hanging (justice is “served” while they eat).

• A hanging uses a single rope-noose (“one”) that tightens on both sides of the neck (“two”), matching the “one for two” wording.  
• The repeated stress on “JUST” and “justice” signals that this is their idea of rough, direct retribution – no trial, no jury.

157,"I was going through some old family photos in the attic when I stumbled upon our family tree.  I studied it for a couple minutes then went back down stairs to tell my mom about the family tree.  The problem is I didn't study it long enough to remember the whole thing.  I only remembered  a couple things about it, and recent memories.  Can you help me figure out my family tree?  There are two grandparents, who had two children, who both got married and had 2 more children each.  Totaling 10 people in all (Alex, David, Jamie, Jessica, John, Justin, Lincoln, Martha, Mary and Tina).
1.  One of Jamie's ancestors was David.
2.  John's sister gave birth to Tina.
3.  Mary went bowling with her nephew last Saturday.
4.  Alex is cousins with one of the girls.
5.  Justin married Mary.
6.  Jessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.
7. Lincoln's brother showed Justin's son his baseball cards.",Martha is a grandparent,"Martha and David were the grandparents.
They gave birth to John and Mary.
John married Jessica, who gave birth to Lincoln and Alex.
Mary married Justin and gave birth to Tina and Jamie.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning  

1.  The structure of the family is fixed:  
    – 2 grandparents (generation 1)  
    – their 2 children (generation 2)  
    – each of those children is married (still generation 2)  
    – each married couple has 2 children (generation 3)  
    = 10 people altogether.  

2.  Clue 2 says John’s sister is Tina’s mother ⇒ John and his sister are the two children of the grandparents (generation 2).  
    John’s sister therefore belongs to the parent-generation and must be the mother in one of the two families of generation 3.

3.  Clue 5 says Justin married Mary.  
    Hence Mary is the sister of John (because she is the only adult female left who can be John’s sister) and her husband is Justin.  
    So:      John     Mary ─ Justin  
             (single)    (married couple)

4.  Each of John and Mary must have two children.  
    From clue 2 Mary’s two children are “Tina and one other child (a boy, because clue 7 speaks of ‘Justin’s son’).”  
    From clue 3 Mary went bowling with her nephew ⇒ John’s children include at least one boy.

5.  Clue 6 says Jessica is not an ancestor or cousin of Tina, so the only rôle left for her is John’s wife (Tina’s aunt, not an ancestor, not a cousin).

6.  So generation 2 is now fixed:  
        Grand-parents:  (still unknown names)  
        Children:       John ─ Jessica  Mary ─ Justin  

7.  Clue 7: “Lincoln’s brother showed Justin’s son his baseball cards.”  
    • Lincoln and his brother are therefore the two children of the same parents;  
    • Justin’s son is a different grand-child, i.e. one of Mary & Justin’s children.  
    The only way to satisfy “brother” (plural) for Lincoln is to put Lincoln and his brother as John & Jessica’s sons and to make Justin’s son the boy in Mary & Justin’s family.

    Thus  
        John & Jessica’s children: Lincoln and Alex (two brothers)  
        Mary & Justin’s children:  Jamie (son) and Tina (daughter)

    Now “Lincoln’s brother (Alex) showed Justin’s son (Jamie) his baseball cards” is satisfied.

8.  Clue 3 (“Mary went bowling with her nephew”) now works: Mary’s nephew is either Lincoln or Alex; pick either, the clue is fulfilled.

9.  Clue 4 (“Alex is cousins with one of the girls”) is true: Alex’s girl-cousin is Tina.

10. Clue 1 (“One of Jamie’s ancestors was David”) is used to pin down the grandparents’ names.  The only names still unused are David and Martha, so they must be the grandparents.  Jamie is their grand-child, so David is indeed Jamie’s ancestor.

Hence the complete tree is:

Generation 1 (grandparents)  
 David  ─  Martha  

Generation 2 (their children & spouses)  
 • John  ─  Jessica  
 • Mary  ─  Justin  

Generation 3 (grand-children)  
 John & Jessica  → Lincoln, Alex  
 Mary & Justin  → Jamie, Tina

Every clue is satisfied, so this is the unique arrangement that works.

Final answer:  
Grandparents: David (grandfather) and Martha (grandmother)  
Their children: John (son) and Mary (daughter)  
John is married to Jessica; their children are Lincoln and Alex  
Mary is married to Justin; their children are Jamie and Tina",True
158,"Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?",Why did they stop on their way to school?,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let us translate every part of the sentence into precise “day-number” language.

1.  Assign the numbers  
   0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, … , 6 = Saturday.  
   Let x be the number of the day on which the children are speaking (“today”).

2.  “When the day after tomorrow is yesterday …”  
   •  The day after tomorrow is x + 2.  
   •  For that day to be yesterday we must move to a time one day later, namely
      x + 3.  
   So the clause “when …” is talking about the day x + 3 (three days in the future).

3.  “… that day was which was ‘today’ when the day before yesterday was tomorrow.”  
   •  The day before yesterday is x – 2.  
   •  For that day to have been tomorrow, we must look at a time one day earlier,
      namely x – 3.  
   Thus the phrase “that day which was ‘today’ …” refers to the day x – 3
   (three days in the past).

4.  The core statement is:

      At the time x + 3, “today” (i.e. x + 3) will be as far from Sunday  
      as the earlier “today” (x – 3) was from Sunday.

   “As far from Sunday” clearly means the (shortest) distance on the
   seven-day cycle.  Define

         d(n) = the distance from n to Sunday = min(n mod 7, 7 – (n mod 7)).

   Hence we need

         d(x + 3) = d(x – 3).

5.  Compute d(x + 3) and d(x – 3) for the seven possible values of x.

          x         x–3    d(x–3)      x+3    d(x+3)
         ------------------------------------------------
          0          4        3          3        3   ← equal
          1          5        2          4        3
          2          6        1          5        2
          3          0        0          6        1
          4          1        1          0        0
          5          2        2          1        1
          6          3        3          2        2

   Equality occurs only when x = 0.

6.  x = 0 corresponds to Sunday.

Therefore the children’s “puzzling prattle” took place on a Sunday.

Final answer: Sunday",True

160,"Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?",The fraction is in sevenths,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.
(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.  Obviously, I've changed the names).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  
W = the fraction of the estate that goes to the widow,  
M = the fraction that goes to the boy (Manny),  
G = the fraction that goes to the girl (Goodie).

What Biggie’s will really fixes is the ratio between each child’s share and the widow’s share, depending on the child’s sex:

•  If the child is a boy, his share is twice the widow’s share.  
  ⇒ M : W = 2 : 1  (1)

•  If the child is a girl, her share is half the widow’s share.  
  ⇒ G : W = 1 : 2  (2)

When both a boy and a girl are born, both of these ratio rules must hold simultaneously.  Equations (1) and (2) therefore give

  M = 2W,  G = ½W.

Because the whole estate must be distributed,

  W + M + G = 1  
  W + 2W + ½W = 1  
  (3½)W = 1  
  W = 2⁄7.

Substituting W = 2/7 into the expressions for M and G:

  M = 2W = 4⁄7,  
  G = ½W = 1⁄7.

Thus the judge awarded

 •  4/7 of the estate to Manny (the son),  
 •  2/7 of the estate to Faerie (the widow),  
 •  1/7 of the estate to Goodie (the daughter).

Final answer: Manny gets 4/7, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7 of Biggie’s estate.",True

163,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.

Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.

Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.

Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that

Behaviour rule  
• One student is a Truth–teller (all three of his/her statements true).  
• One is a Liar (all three false).  
• One is a Mixer (at least one true and at least one false).

Enumerate the six possible one-to-one assignments of books to students.

1) (P,C,M) = (A,B,C)  
2) (A,C,B)  
3) (B,A,C)  
4) (B,C,A)  
5) (C,A,B)  
6) (C,B,A)

Evaluate every set of nine statements for each permutation.

Case 1 (P,C,M) = (A,B,C)

 Anu T T T  (all true)  
 Bob T F T  (mixed)  
 Coy F F F  (all false)

This exactly fits the required Truth–teller / Mixer / Liar pattern.

Cases 2 – 6  

For every other permutation at least one of the following happens:
 • two pupils tell the truth, or  
 • two pupils lie, or  
 • all three pupils are mixers,  
so none of them satisfies the behavioural rule.

Hence the only possible distribution is

 Physics → Anu  
 Chemistry → Bob  
 Maths → Coy

and the behaviour of the pupils is

 Anu always tells the truth  
 Coy always lies  
 Bob sometimes true, sometimes false.

Therefore the statements that can be concluded are

1) Anu always tells the truth.  
2) Coy always lies.  
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.

All three conclusions follow.

166,"Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".","Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.  Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"A quickest sequence that respects every one of the stated rules is:

• Jump 1 – 12 inches WEST  
• Jump 2 – 6 inches NORTH  
• Jump 3 – 6 inches EAST  
• Jump 4 – 6 inches SOUTH

Why this works  
1. Directions: every jump is exactly along a cardinal direction (rule 6).  
2. Lengths: 12″, 6″, 6″ and 6″ are all between the 6″ minimum and the 72″ maximum allowed for a single jump (rule 5).  
3. “Four jumps in one direction before changing”: Grobi completes a block of four consecutive jumps before any possibility of turning again, so the block-of-four requirement is met (rule 7).  
4. Net displacement:  
   • After Jump 1, Grobi is 12″ west of his start.  
   • After Jump 2, he is 12″ west and 6″ north.  
   • After Jump 3, he is 6″ west and 6″ north.  
   • After Jump 4, the 6″ south exactly cancels the 6″ north, leaving him 6″ west of where he began – i.e. precisely on top of the mushroom whose centre lay 6″ to the west.  
5. With his centre now coincident with the mushroom’s centre, Grobi lands directly atop it and can eat (rules 8–9).

Thus Grobi reaches the mushroom in the minimal four jumps, travelling 12″ W, 6″ N, 6″ E, 6″ S.",True
167,"A king heard that the nearby kingdoms were being destroyed by a fierce dragon. He called forth his most trusted and skilled knights to meet and plan how to protect the kingdom.  The 6 knights, Sir William, Sir Andrew, Sir Luke, Sir Calvin, Sir Charles and Sir Vincent, decided that two knights would venture out to find and slay the dragon while the other 4 would defend the kingdom.
From the statements below, which two knights went to seek the dragon?
1. If neither Sir William or Sir Vincent rode out, then Sir Calvin did.
2. If either Sir Calvin or Sir Vincent went to kill the dragon, then Sir Andrew did not.
3.  If neither Sir Andrew or Sir William were of the brave two that left the kingdom, then Sir Charles was.
4.  If neither Sir Luke or Sir Andrew went out, then Sir Vincent did.
5. If Sir William was one of the two, then either Sir Calvin or Sir Charles was with him.
6. If Sir Vincent was not of the two who went to slay the dragon, then neither was Sir Andrew nor Sir Charles.","If statement 1 is valid, Calvin was one of the two that left. If not, either William or Vincent was one of the two. Therefore the PAIR could not be Andrew and Luke, Sir Andrew and Charles or Luke and Charles.","Sir Vincent and Sir Charles went out of the kingdom to slay the dragon.
If statement 1 is valid, Calvin was one of the two that left. If not, either William or Vincent was one of the two. Therefore the PAIR could not be Andrew and Luke, Sir Andrew and Charles or Luke and Charles.
From 3, the PAIR that left was not Luke and Calvin, Luke and Vincent or Calvin and Vincent. From 4, the two could not have been William and Calvin, William and Charles or Calvin and Charles.
From 5, William did not venture out and therefore from 4 the pair was not William and Calvin or William and Charles.
From 6, Vincent must have been one of the two since the statement identifies three of the four knights not eliminated. From 2, Vincent was one of the two, and by elimination, the other is Charles.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

W = “Sir William went”,  
A = “Sir Andrew went”,  
L = “Sir Luke went”,  
C = “Sir Calvin went”,  
Ch = “Sir Charles went”,  
V = “Sir Vincent went”.  

Exactly two of these six statements are true.

Translate the six clues into symbolic form:

1. (~W ∧ ~V) → C               
2. (C ∨ V) → ¬A                
3. (~A ∧ ~W) → Ch              
4. (~L ∧ ~A) → V               
5. W → (C ∨ Ch)                
6. ¬V → (¬A ∧ ¬Ch)            

Step 1.  Suppose V is false.  
 From (6): ¬V → ¬A ∧ ¬Ch, so A and Ch are both false.  
 From (4): ¬V → (L ∨ A); with A false this forces L true.  
 Thus one of the two knights is L; the other must be W or C (only they remain).

 • Pair {L,W}: violates (5) because W would require C or Ch to accompany him.  
 • Pair {L,C}: violates (3) because (~A ∧ ~W) is true, yet Ch would have to be true.

 So every choice with V false is impossible.  
 Therefore V is true – Vincent must be one of the two knights.

Step 2.  With V true we have:

 • From (2): (C ∨ V) → ¬A ⇒ A is false.  
 • From (6) (contrapositive): (A ∨ Ch) → V, automatically satisfied because V is already true.

We now need exactly one more knight, chosen from {W, L, C, Ch}.  Test each candidate:

 a) Second knight W (pair {V,W})  
  (5) demands W → (C ∨ Ch).  Neither C nor Ch would be going, so violation.

 b) Second knight L (pair {V,L})  
  In (3) we have (~A ∧ ~W) → Ch.  Here A and W are false, so Ch must be true—contradiction.

 c) Second knight C (pair {V,C})  
  Again (~A ∧ ~W) is true, so (3) forces Ch to be true—contradiction.

 d) Second knight Ch (pair {V,Ch})  
  Check every rule:

  1. (~W ∧ ~V) → C — antecedent false (V true), OK.  
  2. (C ∨ V) → ¬A — antecedent true (V), A false, OK.  
  3. (~A ∧ ~W) → Ch — antecedent true, consequent true, OK.  
  4. (~L ∧ ~A) → V — antecedent true (L false, A false), V true, OK.  
  5. W → (C ∨ Ch) — antecedent false (W false), OK.  
  6. ¬V → (¬A ∧ ¬Ch) — antecedent false (V true), OK.

 All statements are satisfied.

Hence the unique feasible pair is Vincent and Charles.

On which day of the week does Steve tell the truth?",The first and third statements are incompatible,"Mad Ade's cousin  Steve tells the truth on Tuesdays
The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth. But, they have no such day in common. Therefore one of them must be true, and the other must refer to that day. Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let T be the fixed day of the week on which Steve always tells the truth; on the other six days he always lies.

S₁ (said on D₁) : “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.”  
S₂ (said on D₂) : “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.”  
S₃ (said on D₃) : “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.”

1.  Truth values of S₁ and S₃ depend only on T  
   • Steve “lies on X” exactly when X ≠ T.  
   • Therefore  
     S₁ is true  ⇔  T ≠ Monday and T ≠ Tuesday.

2.  Truth value of S₂ depends only on the calendar day D₂  
     S₂ is true  ⇔  D₂ ∈ {Sunday, Saturday, Thursday}.

3.  A statement made on Dᵢ is true iff Dᵢ = T, and false otherwise.

4.  Test every possible choice of T

   T = Monday  
   S₁ false, S₃ true → D₁ ≠ T, D₃ = T ⇒ (D₁,D₂,D₃) = (Saturday, Sunday, Monday).  
   On Sunday Steve would be lying, yet S₂ (Sunday) would be true—contradiction.

   T = Tuesday  
   S₁ false, S₃ true → D₁ ≠ T, D₃ = T ⇒ (D₁,D₂,D₃) = (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday).

   • Monday (liar): “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday” is false (good).  
   • Tuesday (truth-day): “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays” is true (good).  
   All requirements are satisfied.  Thus T = Tuesday works.

   T = Wednesday  
   S₁ true, S₃ false → D₁ = T, D₃ ≠ T ⇒ (D₁,D₂,D₃) = (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday).  
   On Thursday Steve would be lying, yet S₂ (Thursday) is true—contradiction.

   T = Thursday  
   Both S₁ and S₃ would be true, forcing both D₁ and D₃ to equal T, impossible for consecutive days.  
   Contradiction.

   T = Friday  
   S₁ true, S₃ false → D₁ = T, D₃ ≠ T ⇒ (D₁,D₂,D₃) = (Friday, Saturday, Sunday).  
   On Saturday Steve would be lying, yet S₂ (Saturday) is true—contradiction.

   T = Saturday or Sunday  
   Both S₁ and S₃ become true, again forcing two different consecutive days both to equal T—impossible.

The only consistent assignment is T = Tuesday.

Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.

15 lb, 16 lb, 18 lb, 19 lb, 20 lb, 31 lb.  
Five of them are Kebabrie, one is Chillirella.

1.  Norma buys 2 Kebabrie.  
 Call their total weight N.

2.  Laura buys Kebabrie whose total weight is 2 N.

3.  Therefore the total weight of the pieces bought by the two ladies is

1. Let T be the total number of truthtellers among the 12 men.  
2. Man i (for i = 1, 2, …, 12) says: “At most i – 1 of us are truthtellers.”  
   Statement Sᵢ is therefore “T ≤ i – 1”.

   He is a liar exactly when T > i – 1 (i ≤ T).
4. Hence every man with index i ≥ T + 1 is a truthteller, and every man with index i ≤ T is a liar.

From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation.

Let each door be a vertex of a directed graph.  
The rules

A → B or E  
B → C or E  
C → D or F  
D → A or F

F → C or D  

give the allowable edges for consecutive doors.  
We must find a sequence that

• contains each door exactly once (a Hamiltonian path), and  
• begins with an exit door (the prisoner starts inside) and thereafter alternates Exit / Entrance, because the doors themselves are one-way and the prisoner must be outside to use an entrance and inside to use an exit.

From the guards’ movements we know  
A and F are entrances (guards entered through them)  
B is an exit (guards left through it).

Thus three entrances must be A, F and exactly one of {C, D, E}; the other two of that set must be exits.

Trying possible starting exits we find the only sequence that satisfies all edge rules and the alternation of exits and entrances is

C (Exit) → F (Entrance) → D (Exit) → A (Entrance) → B (Exit) → E (Entrance).

Every edge in this chain is allowed by the rules, each door appears once, and the exit/entrance pattern is X E X E X E as required.

182,"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again.

Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step

1. You have three indistinguishable pills in your hand.  
   • They consist of 1 Sildenafil (S) and 2 Citrates (C).  

2. Get a pill-cutter (or a razor blade) and cut EACH of the three pills in your hand exactly in half.  
   • You now have 6 half-pills.  
   • From every original pill one half went to the left, the other half to the right.

3. Form two separate piles:  
   Pile A = one half from each of the three original pills.  
   Pile B = the remaining three halves.  
   Because each original pill was split between the two piles, the content of the piles is known even though the pills are not marked:  
   – Each pile contains ½ S (half of the one Sildenafil)  
   – Each pile contains ½ C + ½ C = 1 full Citrate dose  
   So every pile is “½ S + 1 C”.

4. Take ONE new Sildenafil tablet out of the bottle (you know what it is because it is still in the correct bottle).  
   Cut this tablet in half. You now have two ½ S pieces.

5. Add one of those ½ S pieces to Pile A and the other ½ S piece to Pile B.  
   Contents now:  
   – Pile A = (½ S from step 3) + (½ S just added) + 1 C = 1 S + 1 C  
   – Pile B = identical.

6. Swallow all of Pile A right now. That gives you exactly today’s dose: one full Sildenafil and one full Citrate.  

7. Save Pile B in a labelled container; it will be tomorrow’s dose, also exactly one Sildenafil and one Citrate.

Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false.

If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning summary  
1. Translate each fact into a logical implication and its contrapositive.

   • If Ben is not the landlord or Ben isn’t in #2 ⇒ Dan is not east of Al (Dan west of Al).

2. Test each possible landlord.

A. Suppose Al were landlord.  
   – Then Al ≠ #1 forces Carl next to Ben.  
   – Dan not landlord forces Al west of Carl.  
   – Ben not landlord forces Dan west of Al.  
   That gives Dan < Al < Carl and Ben adjacent to both Dan and Carl.  
   No ordering of 1-2-3-4 can satisfy all of those simultaneously, so Al cannot be landlord.

B. Suppose Ben were landlord.  
   – Carl must be next to Ben; Dan must be next to Ben ⇒ Ben must be in #2 or #3 with Carl on one side and Dan on the other.  
   – Dan not landlord forces Al west of Carl; Ben in #2 fails this, so Ben must be in #3.  
   – But then Dan is east of Al, triggering fact 4, which would require Ben in #2, a contradiction.  
   Hence Ben cannot be landlord.

C. Suppose Carl were landlord.  
   – Al not landlord forces Carl next to Ben.  
   – Dan not landlord forces Al west of Carl.  
   – Ben not landlord forces Dan west of Al, giving Dan < Al < Carl.  
   Place the four people accordingly: Dan-1, Al-2, Carl-3, Ben-4.  
   Check each original implication:  
     1. Carl is next to Ben, so antecedent false → OK.  
     2. Al is not east of Carl → antecedent false → OK.  
     3. Ben not next to Dan (true) ⇒ Carl landlord in #3 (true) → OK.  
     4. Dan not east of Al → antecedent false → OK.  
   All conditions are satisfied.

D. Dan cannot be landlord (analogous reasoning shows contradictions).

Therefore the only consistent possibility is that Carl is the landlord.

On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year.

Fast clock: gains 10 s every real hour  
Slow clock: loses 10 s every real hour

So the two clocks drift apart at

 10 s + 10 s = 20 s per real hour.

Their dials are ordinary 12-hour dials, so as soon as their readings differ by 12 h (= 43 200 s) they will once again show the same reading.

Time needed for that drift:

 20 s / h  ×  t h  =  43 200 s  
 t = 43 200 / 20 = 2 160 h = 90 days.

Therefore the next coincidence of the two faulty clocks occurs exactly 90 real days after they were set.

Joe says this next coincidence will be on Smoe’s 47th birthday; Smoe agrees.  
Thus the day of setting + 90 days = Smoe’s birthday.

Let Smoe’s birthday be May B of some year that is not yet a leap year determination.  
Count backwards 90 days from May B:

In an ordinary (non-leap) year the days from Jan 1 to May B-1 are  
31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + (B – 1).  
That is 120 + (B – 1) = 119 + B days.

We need 119 + B – 90 to land in January; i.e.  
0 ≤ (119 + B – 90) ≤ 30.  
This gives B = 1, and the January date then is 119 + 1 – 90 = 30, i.e. January 31.

In a leap year (Feb = 29) we would get 121 + (B – 1) – 90 ≥ 31, which is already into February, so a leap year is impossible.

Hence:
• The clocks were set at noon, 31 January of a non-leap year.  
• 90 days later is 1 May, so Smoe’s birthday is 1 May.  
• His 47th birthday therefore occurs on 1 May 1979 (1979 is not a leap year).  
• Hence Smoe was born 1 May 1932, and Joe, the other May baby, must have been born in 1933.

Therefore Smoe is the one born in 1932 and is the older of the two.

Final answer: Smoe is older.",True

189,"You are back on the same game show with four other contestants. You didn't realise last time that the winner gets another appearance on the show! You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

190,"A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let “white’’ = 1, “black’’ = 0 and let w be the (unknown) total number of white hats on all prisoners’ heads.  
Before they come out the prisoners agree on the single rule below, and nothing else.

Agreed rule (parity rule)  
“Assume that, when everything is finished, the total number of white hats will be even.  
After you are lined up, look at the hats of all the other prisoners.  
• If you see an even number of white hats, guess ‘black’.  
• If you see an odd number of white hats, guess ‘white’.”

Why it works  
For a given prisoner i let w-i be the number of white hats he can see (everyone except himself).

Case 1 :  w is even.  
• If i actually wears white (1) then w-i = w – 1 is odd → he guesses white → correct.  
• If i actually wears black (0) then w-i = w is even → he guesses black → correct.  
Thus everyone is correct; they all go free.

Case 2 :  w is odd.  
• If i actually wears white (1) then w-i = w – 1 is even → he guesses black → wrong.  
• If i actually wears black (0) then w-i = w is odd → he guesses white → wrong.  
Thus every single prisoner is wrong; again they all go free.

So no matter how the warden distributes the hats, the prisoners’ answers are either all right (when the total number of white hats is even) or all wrong (when it is odd). The warden cannot prevent their release.

Final answer:  Each prisoner counts the white hats he sees, assumes the total number of white hats must be even, and guesses the color that makes the overall parity even; this guarantees that either everyone guesses right (if the actual total is even) or everyone guesses wrong (if it is odd), so they always go free.",True

1. If Derek had the Silver Dream, rule 4 would force Merick to have the Devine Lightning and Eric the Rusting Bucket;  
   but rule 7 would then require Derek to have the Rusting Bucket, contradicting Derek having the Silver Dream.  
   Therefore Derek cannot get the Silver Dream.

2. If Derek had the Golden Pleasure, rule 1 would force Berrick to have the Silver Dream and Eric the Rusting Bucket;  
   rule 5 would then require Derek to have the Devine Lightning, contradicting Derek having the Golden Pleasure.  
   Therefore Derek cannot get the Golden Pleasure.

3. If Derek had the Devine Lightning, rule 6 would force Berrick to have the Golden Pleasure and Merick the Silver Dream;  
   rule 9 would then force Eric to have the Golden Pleasure as well, an impossibility.  
   Therefore Derek cannot get the Devine Lightning.

4. The only remaining car for Derek is the Rusting Bucket. So
   Derek → Rusting Bucket.

5. With Derek = Rusting Bucket, rule 8 requires  
   Berrick → Devine Lightning and Eric → Golden Pleasure.

6. The only car left for Merick is the Silver Dream, and rule 9 (Merick = Silver Dream ⇒ Eric = Golden Pleasure) is already satisfied.

All rules are now checked and none are violated, so the unique consistent assignment is

• Derek – Rusting Bucket  
• Berrick – Devine Lightning  
• Eric – Golden Pleasure  
• Merick – Silver Dream

Final answer: Derek gets the Rusting Bucket; Berrick gets the Devine Lightning; Eric gets the Golden Pleasure; Merick gets the Silver Dream.",True

193,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change. ","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Number the pumpkins 1-7 around the circle and let 1 mean “lit”, 0 mean “out”.

1.  What happens when you blow on a pumpkin  
   Blowing on pumpkin k toggles (changes 0↔1) pumpkin k itself and its two neighbours k–1 and k+1 (indices taken mod 7).  
   Over the two–element field F₂ (“even/odd arithmetic”) a state of the circle is a 7-tuple  
      (p₁,p₂,…,p₇)∈F₂⁷,  
   and “blow on k” means “add the vector  
      m_k = …0011100…  
   whose 1’s are in positions k–1, k, k+1”.

2.  The algebraic question  
   We start from (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) and want to reach (0,0,0,0,0,0,0).  
   Equivalently we look for coefficients x₁,…,x₇∈F₂ (x_k = 1 if we blow on pumpkin k an odd number of times, 0 if an even number) such that

        x₁m₁ + x₂m₂ + … + x₇m₇ = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).          (★)

   Writing the seven coordinate equations of (★) we obtain

        x₇ + x₁ + x₂ = 1
        x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 1
        x₂ + x₃ + x₄ = 1
        x₃ + x₄ + x₅ = 1
        x₄ + x₅ + x₆ = 1
        x₅ + x₆ + x₇ = 1
        x₆ + x₇ + x₁ = 1.

   Solving these seven linear equations over F₂:

        x₇ = 1 + x₁ + x₂
        x₃ = 1 + x₁ + x₂
        x₄ = x₂
        x₅ = 1 + x₁ + x₂
        From the 6th equation we get x₂ = 1
        From the 7th equation we get x₁ = 1.

   Substituting x₁ = x₂ = 1 gives

        x₃ = x₄ = 1, x₅ = x₆ = x₇ = 1.

   Therefore the unique solution of (★) is

        x₁ = x₂ = … = x₇ = 1.

   In words: each pumpkin must be blown on an odd number of times, and since blowing twice cancels itself, the minimum is exactly once apiece.  No shorter sequence is possible, because the linear system has this single solution.

3.  A concrete winning sequence  
   Any order in which every pumpkin is blown on exactly once works.  The simplest is to march round the circle:

        blow 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

   Checking quickly:

        after 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0  
        after 2: 0 1 1 0 1 1 0  
        after 3: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0  
        after 4: 0 1 0 0 1 0 0  
        after 5: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0  
        after 6: 0 1 0 0 0 0 1  
        after 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.

   All seven lanterns are out, the Ward is broken, and no dark riders will visit.

Final answer: blow on every pumpkin exactly once (for instance, 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7); after these seven blows all the jack-o’-lanterns will be extinguished, and this is the only (hence minimal) way to succeed.",True

Assume that Statements (4), (5) and (6) are all true. Then, Statement (1) is false. But then Statement (2) and (3) both can not be true. Thus, contradictory to the fact that exactly one statement is false.
So Statement (4) or Statement (5) or Statement (6) is false. Also, Statements (1), (2) and (3) all are true.
From (1) and (2), there are 11 men and women. Then from (3), there are 2 possible cases - either there are 8 men and 3 women or there are 3 men and 8 women.
If there are 8 men and 3 women, then there is 1 child. Then Statements (4) and (5) both are false, which is not possible.
Hence, there are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children. Statement (4) is false.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 M = number of men  
 W = number of women  
 C = number of children  

and label the six notes

S1  M + C = 9  
S2  W = C + 2  
S3  M · W = 24  
S4  “One of the groups numbered 4” (i.e. M = 4 or W = 4 or C = 4)  
S5  “One of the groups numbered 6” (i.e. M = 6 or W = 6 or C = 6)  
S6  “One of the groups numbered 8” (i.e. M = 8 or W = 8 or C = 8)

Exactly one of these statements is wrong.

Try each in turn to be the sole false statement.

1.  Assume S1 is false, S2–S6 all true.  
 S4–S6 being true forces the three group-sizes to be 4, 6 and 8.  
 But with these numbers no selection satisfies simultaneously S2 (W = C + 2) and S3 (M·W = 24).  
 So S1 cannot be the lone false statement.

2.  Assume S2 is false, the others true.  
 Again S4–S6 force the set {M, W, C} = {4, 6, 8}.  
 No choice of these values gives M + C = 9 (S1), so impossible.

3.  Assume S3 is false, the others true.  
 With S4–S6 true we still have the set {4, 6, 8}.  
 No ordering of 4, 6, 8 fulfils both S1 and S2, so impossible.

4.  Assume S4 is false, S1, S2, S3, S5, S6 all true.  
 Then some group is 6 (S5), some is 8 (S6), but none is 4.  
 Use the three true equations:

  M + C = 9  (1)  
  W = C + 2  (2)  
  M · W = 24  (3)

 From (2): W = C + 2.  
 Put this in (3): M = 24 / (C + 2).  
 Insert M in (1): 24 / (C + 2) + C = 9.  
 Multiply by (C + 2): 24 + C(C + 2) = 9(C + 2)  
 ⇒ C² + 2C + 24 = 9C + 18  
 ⇒ C² – 7C + 6 = 0  
 ⇒ (C – 6)(C – 1) = 0 → C = 6 or C = 1.

 C = 1 gives W = 3, M = 8 –– but then there is no group of 6, contradicting S5.

 C = 6 gives W = 8, M = 3.  
 Now check the statements:

 S1 3 + 6 = 9  ✓  
 S2 8 = 6 + 2  ✓  
 S3 3·8 = 24  ✓  
 S4 No group has 4 ✗  
 S5 There are 6 children ✓  
 S6 There are 8 women ✓

 Only S4 is false – exactly what we need.

5.  If S5 or S6 were chosen to be the single false statement, one can run the same algebra and show no solution satisfies all the requirements.

Hence the only consistent possibility is the one found in step 4.

Numbers present: Men = 3, Women = 8, Children = 6.  
The mistaken note is statement 4 (“There were 4 of one group”).

Final answer: Statement 4 is false; there were 3 men, 8 women and 6 children at the party.",True
