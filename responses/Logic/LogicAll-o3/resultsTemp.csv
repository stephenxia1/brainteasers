37,"Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?
 Hint: What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We argue by (public-knowledge) induction on the number N of blue-eyed islanders.

Step 0 – why the guru’s sentence matters  
Before the announcement every islander may see blue eyes on others, but no one knows that *everybody* knows blue eyes are present.  
When the guru – whose veracity is unquestioned and whose words are heard by all – states

 “I see a person with blue eyes,”  

the fact “there is at least one blue-eyed person” becomes common knowledge: every islander knows it, knows that everybody knows it, and so on.  
This common-knowledge trigger is what allows any deduction at all.

Induction base: N = 1  
Suppose there were exactly one blue-eyed islander B.  
• B sees no blue eyes.  
• All brown-eyed islanders see one blue pair (B’s).  
Hearing the guru, B reasons:  
“If my eyes were not blue, *nobody* would have blue eyes, contradicting the guru. Therefore my eyes must be blue.”  
B can be certain immediately and boards the first night.  
(Brown-eyed people see B leave and remain.)

Induction step: assume the rule true for N – 1 blue-eyed islanders, show it for N.  
Let the actual number of blue-eyed islanders be N ≥ 2, called B₁,…,B_N.  
Fix one of them, say B₁.  B₁ sees N – 1 blue-eyed people.  
He reasons in two exhaustive cases.

Case 1  (B₁’s eyes are brown).  
Then only N – 1 blues exist.  By the induction hypothesis all blue-eyed people would deduce their condition and leave together on the (N – 1)-st night.

Case 2  (B₁’s eyes are blue).  
Then N blue-eyed islanders exist, and nothing happens on night N – 1.

Now B₁ waits and watches the pier every night.  
• If the N – 1 people he sees were the only blues, they would depart on night N – 1.  
• When sunrise of day N arrives and no one has left, Case 1 is refuted, so Case 2 must be true: B₁ himself is blue.  

Exactly the same reasoning is carried out by every blue-eyed islander; each reaches certainty at dawn of day N, and all N of them go to the ship together on night N.  
Brown-eyed islanders never become certain of their own colour (each still considers the possibility that he is blue and the leavers have already gone), so they stay forever.

Apply the induction to the concrete numbers: N = 100.  

Result  
• Nights 1 through 99: nobody leaves.  
• Night 100: the 100 blue-eyed islanders, having become absolutely certain that their own eyes are blue at sunrise of day 100, correctly tell the captain “My eyes are blue” and all depart.  
• All 100 brown-eyed islanders remain on the island.

Final answer: The 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night after the guru’s announcement; everyone else stays.",True
38,"Question: It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.
 Hint: When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let N be the largest possible number of drops you are forced to make no matter where the critical floor lies.  
Work backward from the moment you are down to one ball (the situation mentioned in the hint).

1. When only one ball remains you must test floors one-by-one, so if at that moment there are r floors still in doubt it will take at most r further drops.  
2. Let the first floor you try with the first ball be k.  
   • If it breaks there, you have already used 1 drop and there are at most k-1 floors left to check with the second ball, so the total number of drops would be ≤k.  
   • If it does not break, you want the same worst–case limit k to hold for the remainder of the procedure.  
     Hence the next floor must be k+(k-1).  
3. Repeating the argument, the successive “gaps’’ must shrink by 1 each time:

   k , k+(k−1) , k+(k−1)+(k−2) , … 

   After m such steps the last floor reached is
        k+(k−1)+…+(k−m+1)=k(k+1)/2−(k−m)(k−m+1)/2.

   We need the sequence long enough to reach (or pass) floor 100.  
   The smallest k with k(k+1)/2 ≥ 100 is k = 14 because 14·15/2 = 105.

Therefore the worst-case number of drops can be held to 14, and no smaller worst-case number is possible.

Taking k = 14, the floors are obtained by adding gaps of 14,13,12,… until we reach the top of the building:

• 14  
• 14+13 = 27  
• 27+12 = 39  
• 39+11 = 50  
• 50+10 = 60  
• 60+ 9 = 69  
• 69+ 8 = 77  
• 77+ 7 = 84  
• 84+ 6 = 90  
• 90+ 5 = 95  
• 95+ 4 = 99  
• 99+ 3 = 102 (>100, so stop at 100)

Hence an optimal strategy is:

Drop the first ball from floors  
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100  
in this order, stopping as soon as it breaks.  
The moment the first ball breaks, start with the second ball at the floor just above the last floor known to be safe and proceed one floor at a time upward.

No matter where the true critical floor lies, you will need at most 14 drops, and 14 is the minimum possible with only two balls.

Final answer: Drop first ball successively from floors 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100, using the second ball to check every floor one-by-one after the first ball breaks; this guarantees finding the highest safe floor in at most 14 drops, which is optimal.",True

Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.
 Hint: Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.

41,"Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)
 Hint: The number of days depends on the number of red hats.",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Reasoning (induction on the number R of red–hatted dwarves)

1.  Base case R = 1  
    • The single red-hatted dwarf sees 99 blue hats.  
    • He was told there is at least one red hat.  
    • Because he sees none, he must himself be the red-hatted dwarf.  
    • He therefore stays away after the first night.  
    → All red hats disappear after 1 day.

2.  Inductive step  
    Assume that if there are exactly k red hats, all k leave together after k days.  
    Now suppose there are k+1 red hats.

    • Every red-hatted dwarf sees k red hats on the others.  
    • Each reasons: “If my hat were blue, there would only be k red hats, so by the induction hypothesis those k would all stay away after k nights.”  
    • When the k-th night passes and no one has stayed away, each concludes that the assumed situation “my hat is blue” is impossible.  
    • Hence his own hat must be red, and all k+1 red-hatted dwarves stay away after the (k+1)-st night.

    Thus, if the statement is true for k it is true for k+1, completing the induction.

Conclusion
If there are R red hats, all R red-hatted dwarves stop coming after the R-th night.  
Therefore the feast is free of red hats exactly R days after the announcement.

Final answer: It takes as many days as there are red-hatted dwarves; i.e. R days if R dwarves wear red hats.",True

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.

1. The sum of the top row is greater than the sum of the middle row, which is greater than the sum of the bottom row.
2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.
 Hint: Start with casework on clue 2.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Reasoning

1.  There are 9 letters, so the numbers 1-9 are used, each once.  Let  

 Row 1 s₁ = A + B + C  
 Row 2 s₂ = D + E + F  
 Row 3 s₃ = G + H + I  

 and s₁ > s₂ > s₃.  Since 1 + … + 9 = 45,

  s₁ + s₂ + s₃ = 45. (1)

 Let s₂ = s₃ + x (x ≥ 1) and s₁ = s₂ + y (y ≥ 1).  
 Substituting in (1) gives 3s₃ + 2x + y = 45 ⇒ 3s₃ ≤ 42 ⇒ s₃ ≤ 14.  (2)

2.  “E is a prime factor of G.”  
 Within 1-9 the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7.  To have G ≠ E and G ≤ 9 the only possibilities are  

  E = 2 with G ∈ {4, 6, 8}, or E = 3 with G ∈ {6, 9}. (3)

3.  “B + G = H” and H ≤ 9, so G must be small enough that 1 + G ≤ 9.  
 With (3) this leaves just one feasible pair:  

  E = 2 and G = 4. (4)

 (If G = 6 or 8 the smallest possible H already exceeds 9; if E = 3, G = 6 gives s₃ ≥ 15, contradicting (2), and G = 9 makes H impossible.)

4.  Set E = 2, G = 4.  Then B + 4 = H, so H − B = 4.  The only values 1-9 four apart are (1,5).  Thus  

  B = 1, H = 5. (5)

5.  I ≠ 1, and by (2) s₃ = 4 + 5 + I ≤ 14 ⇒ 9 + I ≤ 14 ⇒ I = 3.  
 So row 3 is (4, 5, 3) and s₃ = 12. (6)

6.  From (1) s₁ + s₂ = 45 − 12 = 33, with s₁ > s₂ > 12.  
 Possible ordered pairs (s₁, s₂) are (17,16), (18,15), (19,14), (20,13).

7.  Row 1 contains A, B(=1), C; row 2 contains D, E(=2), F with F > A.

 •  If (s₁,s₂) = (17,16):  
  A + C = 16, D + F = 14, and the remaining numbers are 6,7,8,9.  
  The only way to make 16 is 7 + 9; then 6 + 8 = 14.  
  Take A = 7, C = 9, D = 6, F = 8, and F > A is satisfied.

 •  For (18,15):  A + C = 17 (needs 8 + 9), leaving 6,7 for D,F but then F > A (=9) fails.  

 •  For (19,14) or (20,13): A + C would have to be 18 or 19, impossible with 8 and 9 as the two largest unused numbers.

 Hence the unique feasible row-sum pair is (17,16) and the unique assignment is  

 A = 7, C = 9, D = 6, F = 8. (7)

8.  Verify all clues:

 Row sums: 17 > 16 > 12 ✔  
 E = 2 is a prime factor of G = 4 ✔  
 F (8) > A (7) ✔  
 B + G = 1 + 4 = 5 = H ✔  
 I = 3 ≠ 1 ✔  
 All numbers 1-9 used once ✔

Therefore the number represented by each letter is fixed.

J (Russian) H (English–Russian) F,K,O (English) G (English–French) L (French) M (French–German) N (English–German)

To be able to speak with both neighbours two ladies must share at least one language.

1.  J speaks only Russian, so both of her neighbours must speak Russian.  
   Since only H also speaks Russian, J must occupy an end‐seat and H must
   be the neighbour immediately inside her.

2.  L speaks only French, so her neighbour has to speak French.  
   That can be G (English–French) or M (French–German).  
   Thus the other end–seat is L and the seat next to L is G or M.

3.  F,K,O speak only English, hence none of them may sit next to
   J (Russian), L (French) or M (no English).  
   They must be placed only among English–speakers and always next to
   English–speakers.

4.  M can converse only with G (French), N (German) or L (French).
   Therefore, unless she sits next to L at the end, she must have G on one
   side and N on the other.

5.  Collecting the facts gives exactly three possible language
   “skeletons”.

   I. J H (E-only) (E-only) (E-only) N M G L

   II. J H (E-only) (E-only) (E-only) N G M L

   III. J H ( 4 places that are G,F,K,O in any order ) N M L

   (In II the block FKO must stay together; in III it need not, because N is
   now next to M.)

6.  Filling the names:

   • F,K,O are “interchangeable”; whenever they occupy three consecutive
     places there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them.

   • In pattern I there is only one position for the block FKO ⇒ 6 seatings.

   • In pattern II the block FKO can start in the 3rd or the 4th seat
     (2 positions) ⇒ 2×6 = 12 seatings.

   • In pattern III the four positions 3-6 may be any permutation of
     G,F,K,O ⇒ 4! = 24 seatings.

   Because a line of seats is regarded the same from either end,
   fixing J at the left end already avoids double-counting.

The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?
 Hint: Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.

Exactly one man is F & H & ¬S – we shall call him the good–looking man.



1.  Mad Ade cannot stand at an end  
 Because each of the two men standing next to Mad Ade is not-fair (statement 2), Mad Ade must have two neighbours; hence

 Mad Ade is in place 2 or in place 3.

The men in the five statements are now

 place 1 ?  place 2 Mad Ade  place 3 ?  place 4 ?

and places 1 and 3 are ¬F.

A-1 Who can be the only man with exactly one handsome neighbour?  
If a man stands at an end he has only one neighbour, so an end–man can easily have exactly one handsome neighbour; an interior man has two neighbours.  
If Buster were not at an end, both of his neighbours would have to be handsome or neither of them handsome, so some end-man would also have exactly one handsome neighbour, contradicting statement 3. Hence

 Buster must be at an end.

A-2 Put Buster in place 1 (the left end) – the mirror position works in exactly the same way.  
Let us try to satisfy statement 3 (“Buster and only Buster has exactly one handsome neighbour”):

 Buster’s single neighbour (Mad Ade) must be handsome,  
 so Mad Ade is H.

To keep Buster unique, nobody else may have exactly one handsome neighbour.

• Place 3 already has one handsome neighbour (Mad Ade).  
If place 4 is ¬H the man in place 3 would also have exactly one handsome neighbour.  
Therefore place 4 must be H.

• Place 4 must then have 0 handsome neighbours, so the man in place 3 is ¬H.

• With place 3 = ¬H, Mad Ade’s two neighbours are both ¬H, so Mad Ade has 0 handsome neighbours – good.  
At this point the handsome pattern is

 place 1 Buster ¬H  place 2 Mad Ade H  place 3 ? ¬H  place 4 ? H

and statement 3 is obeyed.

A-3 Now impose statement 4 about scarred neighbours.  
Because Buster is at an end, the only way he can have exactly one scarred neighbour is for his single neighbour (Mad Ade) to be scarred; hence Mad Ade is S.

Write the scar-pattern

 place 1 Buster S?  place 2 Mad Ade S  place 3 ? S?  place 4 ? ¬S (for the good-looking man must be ¬S)

Let the remaining two men be Cliff and Donny.  
Try Cliff in place 3:

 place 3 then touches 1 scarred man (Ade) – but Cliff is
 the ONLY man who must NOT touch exactly one scarred man, so this fails.

Therefore

 Cliff must be in place 4 and is the good-looking man (F & H & ¬S).

Take S(Buster)=S(Mad Ade)=S, S(Donny)=¬S ; then

 Buster touches 1 scarred man;  
 Mad Ade touches 1 scarred man;  
 Donny touches 1 scarred man;  
 Cliff touches 0 scarred men,

exactly as statement 4 requires.

All four original statements are now satisfied, and the unique fair-handsome-unscarred man is

 Cliff Hedge.



─────────────────────────────────────────
CASE B Mad Ade is in place 3
─────────────────────────────────────────
By running through the same four statements one finds that any attempt to
make statement 3 true forces a second man (usually the man at the opposite
end) also to have exactly one handsome neighbour, contradicting the
“only” in statement 3; hence no arrangement is possible with Mad Ade in

Race #7 - Race the second and third horses from the race in which the fastest horse raced initially,
the first and second horses from the group of the second horse in Race #6, and the third horse in Race #6 (that's a total of 5 horses).
The first and second horses in Race #7 are the second and third horses of the entire stable.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We must find, with the smallest possible number of 5-lane races and without using a stopwatch, exactly which three of the 25 horses are the fastest.  
Call the horses H1 , H2 , … , H25.  No two have the same speed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step construction of an optimal procedure
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Races 1–5.  Divide the 25 horses into five groups of five and race the
groups separately.

        Race 1 :  A1 A2 A3 A4 A5        (group A)
        Race 2 :  B1 B2 B3 B4 B5        (group B)
        Race 3 :  C1 C2 C3 C4 C5        (group C)
        Race 4 :  D1 D2 D3 D4 D5        (group D)
        Race 5 :  E1 E2 E3 E4 E5        (group E)

Within every line the order written is the order of finish, so A1 is
faster than A2, A2 faster than A3, etc.

Races 1–5 give the complete ranking inside each group, but nothing
about how the groups compare with one another.

Race 6.  Let the five group-winners run against each other.

        Race 6 :  A1 B1 C1 D1 E1  

Assume the order of finish is

        A1  <  B1  <  C1  <  D1  <  E1 ,                 (1)

where “<” means “is faster than”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Who can still be among the overall three fastest?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of (1) we know

• Every horse in groups D and E is slower than at least the three horses
  A1 , B1 , C1 .  They are therefore excluded from the overall top three.

• In group C, C2 and C3 are both slower than C1, and C1 is already
  slower than A1 and B1, so A1 , B1 , C1 are all faster than C2 and C3.
  Hence C2 and C3 cannot reach the top three.

• In group B, B3 is slower than B2 and than B1, and B1 has been beaten
  only by A1, so again at least three horses outrun B3; B3 is ruled out.

The only horses left with any chance of finishing in the overall top
three are

        A1 , A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , C1 .                      (2)

Exactly six candidates remain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Race 7 – the decisive race
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A1 is already known to be faster than every other surviving candidate
(it won both its races), so it is certainly in the final top three.  
Hence we need only decide which two of the other five horses in (2)
join A1.

Race 7 :  A2 A3 B1 B2 C1

Let the order of finish in Race 7 be

        X1  <  X2  <  X3  <  X4  <  X5 .                  (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Reading the final result
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because A1 beats everybody else:

• Overall 1st = A1.

• Overall 2nd = X1  (fastest among the remaining candidates).

• Overall 3rd = X2  (second-fastest among the remaining candidates).

Why X2 really is 3rd overall:  
Every horse not in Race 7 has already been shown slower than at least
three horses (A1 and the two fastest horses in Race 7), so none of them
can displace X2 from the top three.

Thus after seven races we have the exact three fastest horses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Why seven races are necessary
--------------------------------------------------------------------
After the first six races we are in the situation described by (2):
there are still six plausible candidates for the three medal positions,
and no comparison whatever has been made between some of them (for
instance, between A2 and B1).  One more race is indispensable to
separate them.  Therefore no method can guarantee the answer in fewer
than seven races.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Least possible number of races
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The procedure above needs 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 races and we have just proved
that 6 cannot suffice, so 7 is the minimum.

50,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: Aside from sight, use other senses.","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.
4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.
5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.
10) Check both machines that were active and are now turned off. The one that is warmer is connected to switch B (since it was on most recently), and the cooler one is connected to switch C (which was turned off first).
11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First, note two facts.

1. A saw can run only when its two switches – the back-up switch outside and the machine switch on the saw – are both ON (they are in series).
2. Even after a saw is switched off, the motor casing stays warm for several minutes and the blade does not stop instantly.

The visitor exploits those facts, using only his sense of touch (temperature) and hearing/vibration, as follows.

Inside the room – preliminary step
• He makes sure the machine-switch on every saw is ON.  
  (That guarantees that a saw will respond to its outside back-up switch.)

He now leaves the room and works alone outside.

Outside the room – creating five different “signatures”
1. He switches OFF every one of the five back-up switches; all saws stop – he can hear the silence through the door and feels the vibrations cease.  
   (Now every saw starts cooling from the same temperature.)

2. He turns ON back-up switch A and leaves it ON.  
   (The corresponding saw will be the only one still running when he goes back in.)

3. He turns ON back-up switch B, lets it run for, say, 10 minutes, then turns B OFF.  
   (That saw will be off but very hot when he returns.)

4. He turns ON back-up switch C, lets it run for 4 minutes, then turns C OFF.  
   (That saw will be off and warm, but not as hot as B’s.)

5. He turns ON back-up switch D, lets it run for 1 minute, then turns D OFF.  
   (That saw will be off and only slightly warm.)

6. He never turns back-up switch E on at all.  
   (Its saw will be off and quite cold.)

Immediately after step 5 he re-enters the room.

Inside the room – identifying the pairs
• The ONLY saw that is still running (noise, vibration, spinning blade) is controlled by the back-up switch left ON in step 2; that is switch A.  
• Of the four stopped saws he touches the motor casings:

  – hottest casing  → switch B  
  – warm casing     → switch C  
  – slightly warm   → switch D  
  – cold casing     → switch E

Thus each saw has been given a unique, easily detectable “signature” – running, very hot, warm, slightly warm, or cold – produced solely by the pattern in which the outside switches were operated. From those signatures he can unambiguously match every back-up switch to its saw, exactly as he promised, without ever seeing the machines while he was outside.

Final answer: By turning the five outside switches on for different lengths of time (leaving one running, giving the others distinct degrees of residual heat, and never powering the fifth), then immediately re-entering the room and using the sound/vibration of the running saw and the relative warmth of the other four, the brother can tell which outside switch feeds which inside machine.",True

1 → 1, 2 → 5, 3 → 8, 4 → 6, 5 → 3, 6 → 7, 7 → 2, 8 → 4.

Chess notation for the eight queen‐squares is  
a1, e2, h3, f4, c5, g6, b7, d8.

Why it works  

1.  No two queens share a row or a column: we deliberately used every row once and every column once (the eight different column numbers 1, 5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 2, 4 form a permutation of 1–8).

2.  No two queens share a “down–right” diagonal (↘).  
    Squares on such a diagonal have the same value of (row – column).  
    The eight values are  

       1–1 = 0,  2–5 = –3,  3–8 = –5,  4–6 = –2,  
       5–3 = 2,  6–7 = –1,  7–2 = 5,  8–4 = 4,

    all different, so no two queens lie on the same ↘ diagonal.

3.  No two queens share an “up–right” diagonal (↗).  
    Squares on such a diagonal have the same value of (row + column).  
    The eight values are  

       1+1 = 2,  2+5 = 7,  3+8 = 11,  4+6 = 10,  
       5+3 = 8,  6+7 = 13,  7+2 = 9,  8+4 = 12,

    again all different, so no two queens lie on the same ↗ diagonal.

Because every pair of queens differs in row, in column, and in both diagonal constants, no queen can attack any other queen.  Hence this is a correct solution of the Eight Queens puzzle, obtained by arranging the queens so that successive choices are separated as a knight would move, ensuring they never fall on a common row, column, or diagonal.

54,"Question: A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?
 Hint: Where are the water losses?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"For every operation of a single pound lock one lock-chamber full of water is let out of the upper reach and runs away below the lower gates.  
Loss per lock = 7 000 L ⇒ 7 t (because 1 000 L ≈ 1 t of water).

There are 13 locks in the flight, so one complete transit (either up or down) removes  
13 × 7 t = 91 t = 91 000 L from the summit level; that water finally spills away below the bottom lock – it is this water that has to be replaced.

Tanker capacity: 22 t (≈ 22 000 L).

Number of tanker loads needed for a single boat passage  
= 91 t ÷ 22 t ≈ 4.1.  
So even for one boat the lorry must make five journeys (four full loads and one part load) from the bottom to the top.

If only ten boats a day used the flight the lorry would have to climb the hill about fifty times a day and haul more than 900 t of water – totally impractical and far more expensive than installing (or running) a small pump that recirculates the same water.

Hence the proposed contract to keep the canal supplied by trucking 22-t loads of water from the bottom to the top is not reasonable: the quantity that has to be moved is roughly four times what the lorry can carry for every single locking, so normal traffic would require an impossible number of journeys.",True

X = (the number of true statements among S₁–S₇).

Our task is to find which Sᵢ are true so that the count of true statements really equals X and every sentence says something correct.

Step 1.  Analyse the sentences whose truth–values are almost automatic.

S₂ : “If X = 2 then S₃ is false.”  
S₃ : “If X = 2 then S₂ is true.”

• When X ≠ 2 the antecedent “X = 2’’ is false, so both S₂ and S₃ are automatically true (a material implication with false antecedent is true).  
• When X = 2, S₂ and S₃ cannot both be true, so they would give a contradiction.  
Hence X ≠ 2 and therefore

  S₂ is true, S₃ is true.  (1)

Step 2.  Because at least two statements are already true, X ≥ 2.  
But X cannot be 0 or 1, so X > 2.  Therefore X > 2 implies the antecedent of S₇ (“X > 2’’) is true.

Step 3.  Work out the circumstances making S₆ and S₇ true or false.

S₆ : “If X < 3 then S₅ is false.”  
  S₆ is false ⇔ (X < 3) and (S₅ true).

But X > 2 (from above).  There are only two possibilities for X < 3, namely X = 0 or 1, both impossible.  
Hence X ≥ 3 ⇒ “X < 3’’ is false, so S₆ is necessarily true whenever X ≥ 3.  Thus

  For every admissible X, S₆ is true.  (2)

S₇ : “If X > 2 then S₆ is false.”  
  Its antecedent is true (X > 2), so

  S₇ is true ⇔ S₆ is false.  (3)

But from (2) S₆ is true, hence S₇ must be false:

  S₇ is false.  (4)

Step 4.  Summarise truth-values so far.

True: S₂, S₃, S₆.  
False: S₇.  

That is already three true statements, so X ≥ 3.  Test the admissible values X = 3,4,5,6,7 in turn.

Step 5.  Test X = 3.

S₁ : “X = 3’’ would be true.  
S₄ : “X < 4’’ would be true.  

Then the total number of true statements would be at least 5 (S₁, S₂, S₃, S₄, S₆), contradicting X = 3.  
Therefore X ≠ 3.

Step 6.  Test X = 4.

Truth of each sentence:

S₁ : “X = 3’’ – false.  
S₂ : true (by (1)).  
S₃ : true (by (1)).  
S₄ : “X < 4’’ – false (4 < 4 is false).  
S₅ : “X is a square’’ – true (4 = 2²).  
S₆ : true (Step 3).  
S₇ : false (Step 3 & (4)).

True statements: S₂, S₃, S₅, S₆ → exactly 4 of them.

This fits perfectly: the number of true statements is 4, i.e. X = 4.  Hence we have found a consistent assignment.

Step 7.  Verify that no larger X works.

If X were 5, 6, or 7 then S₁ is false, S₄ is false, S₅ is false (5, 6, 7 are not squares), while S₂, S₃, S₆ remain true and S₇ remains false.  That gives exactly three true statements, never 5, 6 or 7.  So X cannot exceed 4.

Conclusion.  The only possible value is X = 4, and with this value the true statements are

 S₂, S₃, S₅, S₆.

All others (S₁, S₄, S₇) are false, and the tally of true ones is indeed 4.

57,"Question: There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?
 Hint: 2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because what the Emperor really cared about was not only getting the bridge built but also keeping as large a share as possible of the money the bridge would go on producing (toll income, extra tax from new tourists, etc.).  
Company B realised this and therefore did not try to under-bid the construction cost that Company A had already quoted.  
Instead it offered the Emperor three quite different “packages”, each of which the Emperor was free to choose after hearing the details.

Package 1 – “The concession”  
• The Emperor pays Company B only $200 000 in cash.  
• Company B then sub-contracts the actual building to Company A for the known $800 000 (Company B borrows that money itself).  
• In compensation for having had to raise all the building money, Company B receives the exclusive right to collect every penny of toll (or of any other direct bridge revenue) for the next 30 years.  
Cash cost to the Emperor : $200 000  
Future bridge revenue kept by the Emperor : $0  

Package 2 – “The partnership”  
• The Emperor pays Company B $750 000 in cash.  
• Company B again hires Company A and puts in the remaining $50 000 itself (total still $800 000 to build).  
• When the bridge opens, the two parties split every dollar of future bridge revenue 50–50.  
Cash cost to the Emperor : $750 000  
Future bridge revenue kept by the Emperor : 50 %  

Package 3 – “The outright purchase”  
• The Emperor pays Company B $1 000 000 in cash.  
• Company B immediately pays Company A the $800 000 it costs to do the work and keeps the remaining $200 000 as its profit.  
• When the bridge opens, every cent of future bridge revenue belongs to the Emperor’s government alone.  
Cash cost to the Emperor : $1 000 000  
Future bridge revenue kept by the Emperor : 100 %  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Why the $1 000 000 choice was obviously best

Even the most pessimistic projection made by the royal accountants showed that the completed bridge would net the country at least $80 000 a year in tolls and new taxes – well over $2 000 000 in today’s dollars over its 30-year design life (discounted at any reasonable interest rate).  

• Under Package 1 the Emperor would save at most $800 000 in present cash but would have to hand over well above $2 000 000 in future income – a very bad bargain.  
• Under Package 2 the Emperor would save only $250 000 in present cash and would still lose half of those future earnings – still a bad bargain.  
• Under Package 3 the Emperor would pay the extra $200 000 beyond Company A’s bare construction price but would keep every dollar of the revenue stream, whose present value dwarfed that extra outlay.  

Because the numbers were so clear, the Emperor “immediately accepted” Package 3 and ordered the $1 000 000 payment.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
How Company B honestly earned the highest amount

• Whatever package the Emperor chose, Company B was going to have Company A build the bridge for the known cost of $800 000 (Hint 1).  
• The three packages merely shifted who supplied the construction money and who owned the future income (Hint 2: a matter of simple present-value accounting).  
• Under the package the Emperor actually chose, Company B received the full $1 000 000, immediately paid Company A the $800 000 it cost to build, and pocketed an honest $200 000 profit – with no lying, cheating or swindling involved.

Hence the Emperor’s decision sounded “too good to refuse” because, once the future revenue was taken into account, paying Company B the full $1 000 000 was by far the cheapest long-term alternative for the country, and that is exactly how Company B ended up being paid the highest amount.",True
58,"Question: A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?
 Hint: Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 G = number of friends (it is given that G < 10)  
 N = number of Golden kebab tokens each friend first received.  

Hence the total number of tokens is

 total = N G. (1)

Two pairs of sisters are present (4 people).  
Every other friend is a “family of one.”  
Therefore the number of families is

 families = 2  (the two pairs)  + (G – 4)  (the others) = G – 2. (2)

Norha’s proposal: “tokens per family would have been 5 more than tokens per friend.”

 tokens per family = N + 5.  

Equating the two ways of counting the total number of tokens,

 N G = (N + 5)(G – 2). (3)

Expand (3):

 N G = N G – 2N + 5G – 10  
 0   = –2N + 5G – 10  
 2N = 5G – 10  
 N  = (5/2)(G – 2). (4)

Because N is an integer, (G – 2) must be even; hence G is even.  
Since G < 10, the even possibilities are G = 2, 4, 6, 8.

• G = 2 or 4 are impossible (there are already four sisters and Norha is not among them).  
• G = 6 gives N = (5/2)(4) = 10. ✔  
• G = 8 gives N = (5/2)(6) = 15, but later Wendy’s share 15 would have to be evenly split among 7 friends (impossible). ✘  

Thus G = 6 and N = 10 satisfy every condition so far.

Now Wendy refuses her share.  
Her 10 tokens are divided equally among the remaining G – 1 = 5 friends:

 extra to each = 10 / 5 = 2 tokens.

Hence each of those five friends finally receives

 10 + 2 = 12 tokens.

(There is no cutting of tokens, so this is admissible.)

Result
• Number of friends: 6.  
• After Wendy yields her share, each of the other five friends ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.

Final answer: 6 friends, and in the end the five who kept their shares each received 12 Golden kebab tokens.",True

Notation  
d₁d₂…d₁₀ = the 10-digit code, each di a different numeral 0–9.

Step 1  –  Use clues 1 and 2 (the hint)  
d₄d₅ is a two–digit triangular number  
d₅d₆ is a two–digit prime

The two–digit triangular numbers are 10,15,21,28,36,45,55,66,78,91.  
Eliminate those with a repeated digit or beginning with 0: 15,21,28,36,45,78,91.

Check each one and, using the shared digit d₅, list the primes it can form with an extra digit:

15 → 53,59  21 → 13,17,19  28 → 83,89  
36 → 61,67  45 → 53,59  78 → 83,89  91 → 13,17

This produces 15 admissible (d₄,d₅,d₆) triples:

(2,8,3) (2,8,9) (3,6,1) (3,6,7)  
(4,5,3) (4,5,9) (7,8,3) (7,8,9)

Step 2  –  Bring in the arithmetical clues 5 and 6  
5) d₁ + d₆ = 2d₉       6) d₃ + d₆ + d₉ = 14

For every triple above insert d₆ in (5) and (6).  A systematic (but purely logical, no brutish enumeration) check keeps only the possibilities that give digits 0–9 without repetition.  In this filtering every case is eliminated except

d₄=2 , d₅=8 , d₆=3  with d₉=6 , d₁=9 , d₃=5.

(The details: d₆=3 forces d₁=2d₉−3; only (d₉,d₁)=(6,9) keeps digits distinct and lets d₃=14−3−6=5.)

So at this point the partially filled code is

9  d₂  5  2  8  3  d₇  d₈  6  d₁₀

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇   d₈ d₉ d₁₀

Digits already used: {9,5,2,8,3,6}.  Still free: {0,1,4,7}.

Step 3  –  Use clue 3  
3) d₈ = d₂ + 3.  
Among the free digits the only ordered pair differing by 3 is (4,7), so  
d₂ = 4 and d₈ = 7

Step 4  –  Use clue 7 (distance of numerals 8 and 9)  
Digit 9 is at position 1, digit 8 at position 5; there are exactly 3 digits between them, satisfying clue 7 automatically!

Step 5  –  Positions for the last two free digits {0,1}  
Clue 4: d₁₀ < d₁ (=9) so d₁₀ can be 0 or 1.  
Clue 8: “no more than four digits between 1 and 4”; 4 is at position 2, so placing 1 at position 7 leaves exactly four digits between them (positions 3–6) and the clue is met.  
Hence d₇ = 1 and d₁₀ = 0.

Step 6  –  Quick check of every clue

1) d₄d₅ = 28 – triangular ✔  
2) d₅d₆ = 83 – prime ✔  
3) d₈ = 7 = 4 + 3 ✔  
4) d₁₀ = 0 < d₁ = 9 ✔

60,"Question: Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?

Adjacency taken from the diagram  

• Field touches Kvakk, Pool, Lawn, Soria, Star and Longo (fact 8).  
• Lawn–Field–Soria is the only route between Lawn and Soria (fact 2).  
• Longo touches Field, Mountain and Forest, giving Forest–Longo–Mountain (fact 6).  
• Mountain touches Star and flower-heaven; thus Star–Mountain–flower-heaven is a 2-step route (facts 4 and 14).  
• Angel is between Forest and flower-heaven (fact 16).  
• flower-heaven is entered from exactly three gardens: Mountain, Longo and Angel (fact 13).  
• Quack touches only Duck Country and Forest (fact 7); Kvakk–Pool–Duck Country–Quack is the 3-step shortest Kvakk→Quack route (fact 1) and avoids Field, Forest, Angel and Star (fact 5).  
• Quack–Forest–Angel–flower-heaven is the 3-step Quack→flower route, and the two intermediates (Forest, Angel) differ from those between Kvakk and Quack (fact 9).  
• Quack lies east of Kvakk (fact 10) and flower-heaven south-west of Quack (fact 11); the diagram respects those compass directions.  
• Exactly ten distinct gardens are shown besides the two houses and flower-heaven (fact 12).  
• None of the inland gardens borders the sea; all nine coastal objects (Star, Lawn, Mountain, Pool, Soria, Forest, Duck Country, Kvakk and Quack) do border it (fact 15).  
All sixteen facts are therefore simultaneously satisfied.

Shortest Kvakk → flower-heaven route  

Coast and sea block any movement north of Kvakk, so every walk must start by entering The field.  
From Field one may step straight into Longo, and from Longo directly into flower-heaven.  
Thus

Kvakk’s house  →  The field  →  Longo  →  flower-heaven

uses only two intervening gardens, and no shorter path is possible (Field is the only way inland from Kvakk, and flower-heaven is not adjacent to Field).

61,"Question: In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?
 Hint: Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well.

62,"Question: Edgar, Frank, and George are regulars at a pub. All three of them have been regulars since before this month.
1. One regular goes to the pub every two days, one goes every three days, and one goes every seven days.
2. The first day of a certain month that Edgar went to the bar was a Monday. The first day of the same month that Frank went to the bar was a Wednesday. The first day of the same month that George went to the bar was a Friday.
3. There was only one day in that month that all three men went to the pub.
On which day of that month did all three men go to the bar?
 Hint: From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.","From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.","All three men went on the 27th.
From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd. This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. Edgar went to the pub on Monday the 1st and every two days thereafter, Frank went on Wednesday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and George went on Friday the 5th and every seven days thereafter.
2. Frank went on Wednesday the 1st and every two days thereafter, George went on Friday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and Edgar went on Monday the 6th and every seven days thereafter.
If scenario 1 is true, then Edgar went on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, and, depending on the length of the month, the 29th and 31st, Frank went on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and depending on the length of the month, the 30th, and George went on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th. But now there was no day when all three men went to the pub. So this cannot work.
This means that scenario 2 is true. Edgar went on the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th. Frank went on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, and, depending on the length of the month, the 29th and 31st. George went on the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and depending on the length of the month, the 30th. So all three men went on the 27th.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the first days of the month on which Edgar, Frank, and George enter the pub be E, F, G respectively (these are calendar dates such as 1, 2, 3 …).  
Because

 • Edgar’s first visit is on a Monday,  
 • Frank’s first visit is on a Wednesday, and  
 • George’s first visit is on a Friday,

the days of the week differ by

 F – E ≡ 2  (mod 7)  ( Wednesday is two days after Monday )  
 G – E ≡ 4  (mod 7)  ( Friday is four days after Monday )

(1)

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1.  Locate the first visit of the 2-day man.

By the hint, the person who comes every two days must begin on the 1st or the 2nd.  
If he began on the 2nd, then (1) forces the other first–visit dates to be 4 and 6, but
none of 2, 4, 6 can belong to the 3-day man (whose first date must be 1, 2, or 3).  
Hence the 2-day man must begin on the 1st.

So the table of first visits starts

 2-day man : 1

(2)

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2.  Fit the remaining two first–visit dates by (1).

Put E = 6.  Then (1) gives

 F = 1  and  G = 3.

Indeed, with E = 6 we have  
 F – E = 1 – 6 ≡ 2 (mod 7)  and  G – E = 3 – 6 ≡ 4 (mod 7).

Thus the three first visits are

 F = 1 , G = 3 , E = 6.  (3)

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 3.  Assign the remaining periods 3 and 7.

Because the 2-day period is already taken by Frank (F = 1),  
 • George’s first day is 3, so he can be the 3-day man (3 ≤ 3);  
 • Edgar’s first day is 6, so he must be the 7-day man (6 ≤ 7).

Hence

 Frank : every 2 days, beginning with the 1st;  
 George : every 3 days, beginning with the 3rd;  
 Edgar : every 7 days, beginning with the 6th.

All numerical conditions, including the hint, are now satisfied.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 4.  Determine the common visit.

• Frank appears on the odd-numbered days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …  
• George appears on 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, …  
  Their intersection is 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, …  
• Edgar appears on 6, 13, 20, 27, …  

The only date common to all three sequences not exceeding 31 is 27.

Because the three periods 2, 3, 7 are pairwise coprime, a simultaneous
visit recurs every lcm(2,3,7)=42 days; a month has at most 31 days, so
the 27th is the lone day this month on which all three meet.

Therefore the unique day of the month when Edgar, Frank, and George were
all in the pub together is the 27th.

63,"Question: The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.
 Hint: : In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.

Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,,False

If a bound is satisfied it must be marked True; if not, it must be marked False.  
Hence the number of satisfied bounds must equal T itself.

Counting satisfied bounds.

1. Among the five “True” bounds the number satisfied is  
 A(T) = 5 (if T = 0)  
 A(T) = 6 − T (if 1 ≤ T ≤ 5)

 B(F) = 0 (if F ≥ 6).

Only T = 3 fulfills S(T) = T.

Thus we must have exactly 3 True’s and 7 False’s, with

 F = 10 − T = 7 > 5, so none of the five “False” bounds are satisfied  
 T = 3, so among the “True” bounds only those with bound ≥ 3 are satisfied.

Hence the truth values are:

Exactly two mines lie in every row and in every column.

Step 1 – locate the two mines in Row 9  
• Clue 5: in Row 9 the mines are four columns apart.  
• Clue 7: Column I has a mine in Row 9 or 10.  
If the mine were in I10 it would have to be next to another mine in Row 10 (clue 2), i.e. in H10 or J10; H10 is impossible by clue 8 and J10 by clue 1.  
∴ the mine of Column I that is “in Row 9 or 10” is in Row 9 → I9 is a mine.  
Four columns to the left of I is E, so E9 must be the second mine in Row 9.  

Step 2 – determine the two adjacent mines in Row 10  
Because C10 cannot be a mine (clues 3 & 8 would then force H10 to be a mine in an even row) and D10 cannot be a mine (it would force J10 to be a mine – clue 9 – contradicting clue 1), the only possible adjacent pair is F10–G10.  
Thus F10 and G10 are the only mines in Row 10.

Step 3 – place Columns C and H  
Clues 3 and 8 state that the mines in C and H occur in the same two odd-numbered rows.  
Rows 1 and 3 are the only odd rows still empty, so  
C1, H1, C3, H3 are mines.

Step 4 – place Columns D and J  
Clue 9 requires D and J to share two rows.  Using rows that are still empty we may take Rows 2 and 8:  
D2, J2, D8, J8 are mines.

Step 5 – complete Column E  
Column E already contains E9; by clue 6 its other mine must be in Row 5 or higher, and Row 5 is still available.  
∴ E5 is a mine.

Step 6 – satisfy the remaining column totals  
Up to now every column except A, B, F, G, I has only one mine.  We still need exactly one more mine in each of those five columns.  Distributing them so that every row ends with two non-adjacent mines gives

A4 B6 F4 G6 I7

Step 7 – add the fixed mines A5 and B7  
Clue 10 puts a mine at A5; clue 4 puts one at B7.

The complete minefield

Row 1 : C1 H1  
Row 2 : D2 J2  
Row 3 : C3 H3  
Row 4 : A4 F4  
Row 5 : A5 E5  
Row 6 : B6 G6  
Row 7 : B7 I7  
Row 8 : D8 J8  
Row 9 : E9 I9  
Row 10: F10 G10

Every clue is satisfied and each row/column contains exactly two mines.

Step 8 – find a safe path (adjacent moves allowed diagonally)

Start at the safe corner A10 and move as follows:

A10  →  A9  →  A8  →  A7  →  A6  →  B5  →  B4  →  B3  →  B2  →  B1

Every step is to a horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent square, and none of these ten squares appears in the list of mines above, so the path is completely safe and reaches Row 1.

Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.
H) The last four letters can now be assigned values.  D = 1, E = 8, G = 4, and H = 6.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the ten–digit number be  

A B C D E F G H I J  (no leading 0, all digits 0–9 used exactly once).

Translate the clues into equations.

1.  B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = AD
   (AD is the two–digit number whose tens-digit is A and units-digit is D).

2.  B – H = J – G = 3 ⇒ B = H + 3 , J = G + 3. (1)

3.  C – F = E – I = 5 ⇒ C = F + 5 , E = I + 5. (2)

4.  B · I = AJ (the two–digit number AJ). (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Obtain I in terms of F.

Using (1) and (2) in the two equal sums of clue 1:

B + C + F + J
= (H+3) + (F+5) + F + (G+3)
= H + G + 2F + 11.

E + G + H + I
= (I+5) + G + H + I
= G + H + 2I + 5.

Setting them equal gives

H + G + 2F + 11  =  G + H + 2I + 5  ⇒ 2F – 2I = –6  ⇒ I = F + 3. (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Express every letter with the independent digits F, G, H and A.

From (1), (2) and (4):

B = H + 3, C = F + 5, I = F + 3, E = F + 8, J = G + 3. (5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Bound F.

Because E = F + 8 must be a single digit 0–9, F ≤ 1.  
Therefore F = 0 or 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Treat the two possible values of F.

-------------------------------------------------
Case I:  F = 0.

Then C = 5, I = 3, E = 8.  
Use the product condition (3):

B · I = AJ ⇒ (H+3)·3 = 10A + (G+3)
     ⇒ 3H + 9 = 10A + G + 3
     ⇒ G = 3H + 6 – 10A. (6)

Condition J = G + 3 keeps G ≤ 6, hence A cannot exceed 2.  
Examine A = 1 and A = 2 separately.

•  A = 1 gives G = 3H – 4.  
   The only integral H (0–6) that yields a digit 0–6 is H = 3, giving G = 5,  
   but C is already 5, a contradiction.

•  A = 2 gives G = 3H – 14.  
   For G to be a digit 0–6 we need H = 5 or 6.

   – H = 5 ⇒ G = 1 duplicates nothing, but C is 5 = H, impossible.  
   – H = 6 ⇒ G = 4 works and causes no duplication.

Now compute every digit when A = 2, F = 0, H = 6, G = 4:

B = 9 (J = 7) C = 5 D comes from the common sum:

AD = B+C+F+J = 9+5+0+7 = 21 ⇒ D = 1.

Thus the digits are
A=2, B=9, C=5, D=1, E=8, F=0, G=4, H=6, I=3, J=7,

all distinct and 0–9 are present.

Check every clue:

1.  9+5+0+7 = 8+4+6+3 = 21 = AD.  
2.  9–6 = 7–4 = 3.  
3.  5–0 = 8–3 = 5.  
4.  9·3 = 27 = AJ.

All are satisfied, so this case gives a valid number.

-------------------------------------------------
Case II:  F = 1.

Repeating the same analysis one finds that no assignment of
digits avoids duplication, so this case fails.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Assemble the number.

The only admissible set of digits is

A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  
2  9  5  1  8  0  4  6  3  7

Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.
 Hint: Ask someone a question about someone else. ",Ask someone a question about someone else. ,"First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.
In either case, Chuck is the liar.
D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""

D) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the liar?""

Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Label the three men  
Alex = A , Bob = B , Chuck = C.  
All questions will be of the YES/NO type.

Question 1 to Alex  
Q1 : “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”

(The statement “2 + 2 = 4’’ is certainly true.)

Question 2 to Alex  
Q2 : “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?’’ (the identical question, asked immediately a second time)

Look at Alex’s two answers.

• The two answers are different  
 → Alex is the alternating (unreliable) man, for he changed truth-value from the first to the second answer.  
  Only one question is left, and B or C is a consistent man (always true or always false).

 Question 3 to Bob (any one of the two remaining men)  
 Q3 : “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”

 If Bob answers YES, he is the truth-teller and Chuck is the liar.  
 If Bob answers NO, he is the liar and Chuck is the truth-teller.  
 All three men are now identified.

• The two answers are the same  
 → Alex is a consistent man (never changes).  
 If both answers were YES, Alex is the truth-teller.  
 If both answers were NO, Alex is the liar.

 So after the second question we know whether Alex is the truth-teller or the liar; only the alternating man among Bob and Chuck is still unknown.

 Question 3 to Alex  
 Q3 : “Is Bob the alternating (unreliable) man?”

 Because we already know whether Alex always tells the truth or always lies, we can interpret his reply:

 - Alex is the truth-teller (he answered YES to Q1 and Q2)  
  YES → Bob is unreliable, Chuck is the liar.  
  NO  → Bob is the liar,     Chuck is unreliable.

 - Alex is the liar (he answered NO to Q1 and Q2)  
  YES (a lie) → Bob is not unreliable ⇒ Bob is the truth-teller, Chuck is unreliable.  
  NO  (a lie) → Bob is unreliable,      Chuck is the truth-teller.

In every possible pattern of answers all three roles are fixed after exactly three questions.

Final answer: Yes.  
Ask Alex “Is 2+2=4?” twice; if the two replies differ Alex is the alternating man and a single factual question to one of the others identifies which of them is the truth-teller and which the liar.  
If the replies are identical Alex is consistent, so we already know whether he tells truth or lies; a third question to him “Is Bob the alternating man?” then determines the exact roles of Bob and Chuck.",True

Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.

From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:

From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.

 B→① , O→② , X→③ , Y→④.

Step 2.  Words OKAY and EXAM  
 OKAY (= O K A Y) already gives Y on ④, O on ②, so K cannot be on ② or ④.  
 BOXY put X on ③, hence K must be on the same block as X, i.e. K→③.

 so E→④ and M→②.

Step 3.  Words OGRE and GIRL  
 OGRE (= O G R E): O②, E④, so G and R must be on ① and ③ in some order.

Use the clues below to determine the first and last names of the first through fourth place winners of the tournament, the chess opening each used in his last game, and the number of the chess board on which he played his final game.
1. Mr. Hart played the King's Indian Defence.
2. Steve placed ahead of the one who used the Ruy Lopez opening.
3. The top 4 players were Larry, Mr. Korn, the contestant who opened with Queen's Gambit, and a player who played on an even-numbered board.
4. Mr. Rose finished exactly 2 places ahead of the player on board 31.
5. The number of the 3rd place winner's board is at least 10 higher or at least 10 lower than that of Mr. Baird.
6. The number of the board of the contestant who placed immediately after Bert is exactly 15 higher than the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately before Tom.
7. The lowest board number of the top 4 finishers was exactly half the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately after the one who played the Giuoco Piano opening.
8. The highest board number was exactly 8 higher than the board number of the man who finished exactly two places after Bert.

The four letter code word, {@^], can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: The words start with ""W""","The words start with ""W""",Warp and Weft.,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Because the hint says that the two words both begin with the letter “W”, the first symbol “{” must represent W.

The second symbol “@” can be one of M, E, C, A or B.  
Of these five, only A and E commonly form English words when they follow W (there are essentially no ordinary words that begin with WM–, WC– or WB–).

So restrict attention to the two possibilities

 WA _ _  or  WE _ _

The third symbol “^” may be N, F, D, R or E, and the fourth symbol “]” may be L, P, O, A or T.  
Checking the ordinary four-letter English words that can actually be formed under these restrictions gives, among a few others,

 W A R P  (WARP)  
 W E F T  (WEFT)

Both satisfy the letter-set rules:

 {→W  @→A/E  ^→R/F  ]→P/T  (all choices permitted)

No other pair obtained from the allowed letters forms a recognisable pair of opposites.  
In weaving, the warp runs length-wise in the cloth while the weft (also called woof) runs cross-wise; the two directions are perpendicular and are treated as opposites.

Hence the single coded word {@^] can be read in two ways:

 { @  ^ ]  → W A R P (“warp”)

76,"Question: With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?
 Hint: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let t be the number of minutes that have elapsed since the clock was started at 6:00.

Angles are measured in degrees from the 12-o’clock position, increasing clockwise.

1.  The two “correct” hands (imaginary, turning with the right speeds)  
    Minute hand M : M(t)=6t  
    Hour   hand H : H(t)=180+0.5t                     (because at 6:00 the hour hand is at 180°)

2.  The two “wrong” hands mounted on the clock  
    Fast hand F (really the short hour hand, turning with minute speed) : F(t)=180+6t  
    Slow hand S (really the long minute hand, turning with hour speed)  : S(t)=0+0.5t

For the clock to show the right time, observers must see

 fast (short) hand = correct hour position and slow (long) hand = correct minute position, i.e.

 F(t) ≡ H(t) (mod 360) and S(t) ≡ M(t) (mod 360).

Compute the two congruences:

 F(t)−H(t) = (180+6t)−(180+0.5t) = 5.5t = 360k, k∈ℤ ……(1)  
 S(t)−M(t) = (0.5t)−(6t)        = −5.5t = 360m, m∈ℤ ……(2)

Both equations reduce to the single condition

 5.5t = 360n  (n an integer).

Hence

 t = 360n / 5.5 = (360·2/11) n = 720n / 11 minutes.

The clock already showed “correct” time at t = 0; the first later instant corresponds to n = 1:

 t = 720 / 11 minutes  
   = 65 5/11 minutes

78,"Question: Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.
 Hint: Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.
...whew!",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Work backwards from the situation the hint mentions and use the pirates’ (identical) order of preference  

1. stay alive  
2. get as much gold as possible  
3. if the above two are equal, prefer that more other pirates die.  

Step 1.  Two pirates left ( #4 and #5 )  
#4 will be the proposer.  
With only two pirates a proposal passes if at least half the votes are “yes”, so #4’s own vote is enough.  
Therefore he proposes  

#4 : 1000  #5 : 0  

He votes “yes”, #5 votes “no”, the ballot is 1–1 and the motion passes.  
So, if the game ever reaches two pirates, #5 gets 0.

Step 2.  Three pirates left ( #3 , #4 , #5 )  
#3 must obtain at least 2 of the 3 votes.  
If his plan is rejected he will be killed and the game proceeds to Step 1 in which #5 gets 0.  
Therefore offering #5 just 1 gold makes #5 better-off and wins his vote.  
The cheapest winning proposal for #3 is  

#3 : 999  #4 : 0  #5 : 1  

Votes: #3 and #5 “yes”, #4 “no”; 2–1 passes.

Step 3.  Four pirates left ( #2 , #3 , #4 , #5 )  
A proposal now needs at least 2 of the 4 votes ( 50 % or more).  
If #2 is killed, Step 2 occurs and the pay-off there is  

#3 : 999   #4 : 0   #5 : 1.  

To buy one extra vote as cheaply as possible #2 bribes the pirate who would otherwise get 0, namely #4.  
Offering #4 one coin suffices:

#2 : 999  #3 : 0  #4 : 1  #5 : 0  

Votes: #2 and #4 “yes”, #3 and #5 “no”; 2–2 passes.

Step 4.  All five pirates present ( #1 , #2 , #3 , #4 , #5 )  
Now at least 3 of the 5 votes are needed.  
If #1 dies, Step 3 shows the coming distribution will be  

#2 : 999   #3 : 0   #4 : 1   #5 : 0.  

Thus the “expectations” of the others are  

#2 → 999  #3 → 0  #4 → 1  #5 → 0.  

To secure two more votes as cheaply as possible, #1 therefore buys the two pirates whose expectation is 0, i.e. #3 and #5, with 1 coin each:

#1 : 998  #2 : 0  #3 : 1  #4 : 0  #5 : 1  

Votes: #1, #3 and #5 vote “yes” (3); #2 and #4 vote “no” (2).  
Since 3 > 2, the motion passes.

No other division can give #1 more than 998 pieces, because he must win at least two additional votes, and every extra vote costs at least one coin.

Final answer: Pirate #1 can keep 998 gold pieces; his successful proposal is  
998 for himself, 1 for pirate #3, 1 for pirate #5, and 0 for pirates #2 and #4.",True

1st = A, 2nd = B, 3rd = C, 4th = D, 5th = E.

Because of the hint we interpret each letter as a Roman-numeral letter, i.e. as one of  
I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000.

Translate the three numerical conditions:

(i)  “Multiply my fifth by two and you have my first”  
  2·value(E) = value(A).                                   (1)

(iii) “Divide my third by five and you have my second or fourth”  
  value(C) / 5 = value(B) = value(D).                     (3)

Step 1.  From (2) write value(A) = 20·value(C).

Step 2.  From (3) write value(C) = 5·value(B).

Substitute Step 2 into Step 1:

value(A) = 20·(5·value(B)) = 100·value(B).                 (4)

Step 3.  Use (1): 2·value(E) = value(A).  
Insert (4):

2·value(E) = 100·value(B)  ⇒  value(E) = 50·value(B).      (5)

Thus every letter’s value is an integer multiple of value(B):

value(B) = value(D) = k,  
value(C) = 5k,  
value(E) = 50k,  
value(A) = 100k.

All must be among the permitted Roman-numeral values {1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000}.  
Look for k so that 50k is also in the set.

Try k = 1  ⇒  50k = 50  (allowed).  
Values then are

84,"Question: Mary Beem, who was a wife, mother of four and grandmother of nine, was shot to death by an angry relative. Find out the name of the relative it was by piecing together the relationships of each person with the clues below.
The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?
 Hint: Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
So now, knowing that the killer's sister is COUSIN to Bo, Bill's NIECE, and Bob's GRANDDAUGHTER, the killer must be BERNIE.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"First lay out the people who were alive and present at the funeral.  
There are 18 of them (Mary is dead):  
Bob, Bill, Barry, Bart, Buck, Bruce, May, Ben, Missy, Bernie, Mo, Robin, Brad, Bo, Molly, Megan, Myra, Maria.

Because only direct descendants of Mary Beem and the spouses of those descendants were invited, the 18 living persons must be distributed as

• 1 husband (Bob)  
• 4 children of Bob & Mary  
• 4 spouses of those children  
• 9 grandchildren (none married).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Determining Mary’s four children
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• From the clues we are told explicitly that May, Robin and Maria are Bob’s daughters.  
• Bill must also be a child, because the killer’s sister spoke to her “uncle (blood relative) Bill”.  
  (If Bill were only an in-law he would not be a blood uncle.)  

Hence Mary’s four children are

        Bill, May, Robin, Maria.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Attaching the four spouses
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• May’s husband is Ben (clue 3).  
• Robin’s husband is Mo   (clue 4).  
• From clue 1 Bill is talking with his brother-in-law Barry, so Barry must be married to Bill’s sister Maria.  
• The only adult left over is Myra, so she is Bill’s wife (clue 6 mentions her two children).

Thus the four couples of Generation 2 are

        Bill – Myra  
        May  – Ben  
        Robin – Mo  
        Maria – Barry

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Distributing the nine grandchildren
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Every couple has at least two children, and only one couple has three (note).

A. Robin & Mo:  
    Clue 2 speaks of the brothers Bart, Buck and Bruce, and clue 4 says Robin & Mo were watching their “sons”.  
    Therefore Bart, Buck and Bruce are the three sons of Robin & Mo.  
    (This is the only family with three children.)

B. May & Ben (clue 3): children are Missy and Bernie.

C. Bill & Myra (clue 6): one child is Brad.  
    A second child is needed; we leave that blank for a moment.

D. Maria & Barry: We still need two children.  
    Clue 5 tells us Bo and his sister Molly are siblings, and that their cousin is Megan.  
    Therefore Bo and Molly belong to Maria & Barry.

Now only one grandchild’s name is still unused—Megan—so Megan is the second child of Bill & Myra.

Grandchildren summary:

• Bill & Myra:        Brad, Megan  
• May & Ben:          Missy, Bernie  
• Robin & Mo:         Bart, Buck, Bruce  
• Maria & Barry:      Bo, Molly

Total = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 9, as required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Identifying the killer
--------------------------------------------------------------------
“The killer’s sister” (call her S) spoke with
   – her grandfather Bob  
   – her cousin Bo  
   – her blood-uncle Bill.

Therefore S must be a granddaughter who

   (i) has Bill as an uncle → her parent is May, Robin or Maria (Bill’s sisters);  
   (ii) has Bo as a cousin → Bo cannot be her brother.

Check each granddaughter:

• Missy (child of May)  
    – Bill is Missy’s uncle ✔  
    – Bo (child of Maria) is Missy’s cousin ✔  
    Hence Missy fits every part of the description and is S.

• Molly (child of Maria)  
    – Bo would be her brother ✘  (must be cousin).

• Megan (child of Bill)  
    – Bill would be her father, not uncle ✘

Thus “the killer’s sister” is Missy, whose only sibling is Bernie.

Consequently Bernie is the person Missy suspected and the one who was arrested.

Final answer: Bernie",True

4  →  O , I , F , W  
5  →  Z , U , Y , S  
6  →  I , L , E , C  

Because the message is the number 123456, any deciphered word must have

• a letter from {O,U,D,B} in the 1st position,  
• a letter from {S,K,Q,T} in the 2nd position,  
• a letter from {I,H,E,N} in the 3rd position,

• a letter from {Z,U,Y,S} in the 5th position,  
• a letter from {I,L,E,C} in the 6th position.

1.  The hint supplies one word:

2.  We now look for a six-letter antonym of “useful” whose letters all lie in the corresponding sets.  
A standard antonym is “OTIOSE” (meaning “serving no practical purpose, useless”).

Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Hint: There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE. It means that none of the letters in these 7 words can be on the same block as the letter 'E'.

the easiest way is to write down 4 rows each with A to Z, except G and X. Take each word one by one, remove not possible letters and circle the possible letters.
The letters on four blocks are:

91,"Question: Captain John is the captain of a pirate ship called the ""Wasp"".  He just heard about a lost treasure on a far away island.  He needs to get his two crew mates, and lead them to a ship, but there are guards around and he needs to do this without passing them, or they will throw him in the brig.  Can you help him get his two crew mates to the ship without getting sent to the brig?
The positions of everything are in a 3-by-3 grid (1 John, 1 ship, 2 crew mates, 2 guards, and 3 grass areas).  John may only move 1 space at a time, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  He can only go to each space once.
But before he can figure out the right way to go, he must figure out where everything is.  This is what he knew:
1. The Wasp is not in the same row or column as John.
2.  John is not in the same row or column as either guard.
3.  Neither guard is in the third column.
4.  Both guards are vertically next to grass.
5.  The ship is in the same row as one guard, and the same column as the other guard.
6.  One of the grass spaces is diagonally next to both crew mates.

8.  The two guards are not in the same row or column.
 Hint: Use paper and pencil.",Use paper and pencil.,"The positions of everything.

6 - 3 - 1
7 - X - 2",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Label the 3 × 3 board with rows 1–3 (top to bottom) and columns 1–3 (left to right).  
We must place exactly one object in every square:  

• J = John  • W = the Wasp (ship)  • C₁,C₂ = crew mates  
• K₁,K₂ = guards  • G₁,G₂,G₃ = grass squares  

Follow the eight clues one by one.

1.  Neither guard may stand in column 3, so the two guard columns are 1 and 2.  
2.  The guards are in different rows and different columns, hence their rows are also different.  
   ⇒ John cannot share a row or a column with either guard, so John must occupy the only row and the only column that the two guards do not use.  
   Because the guards already use columns 1 and 2, John must be in column 3.  
3.  One grass square is fixed by clue 7 at (1,2).  
4.  Each guard must be vertically adjacent to a grass square.

Try every possible pair of guard-rows:

a) Guards in rows 1 and 2 ⇒ John would be in row 3, column 3, but the required position of the Wasp (clue 5) would force the Wasp onto the already occupied square (1,2).  Impossible.

b) Guards in rows 1 and 3 works:

 Choose K₁ at (1,1) (column 1) and K₂ at (3,2) (column 2).  
 Then John is forced to (2,3).

5.  The Wasp must share the row of one guard and the column of the other.  
 Thus W must be at (3,1) (row 3 of K₂ and column 1 of K₁).  
 This automatically satisfies clue 1: W is neither in John’s row nor in John’s column.

6.  To satisfy clue 4 we must put grass under K₁ and above K₂:  
 G₂ at (2,1) and G₃ at (2,2).

7.  Clue 6 demands a grass square that is diagonally adjacent to both crew mates.  
 The only grass square with two diagonal neighbours still free is G₃ at (2,2); its two free diagonal neighbours are (1,3) and (3,3).  
 Place the crew mates there: C₁ at (1,3) and C₂ at (3,3).

The finished board

            column
          1      2      3
row 1   K₁     G₁     C₁
row 2   G₂     G₃     J
row 3   W      K₂     C₂

Checking all eight clues shows every condition is satisfied.

Finding John’s route  
John starts at J = (2,3) and must visit both crew mates and end on W = (3,1), never stepping on (or even revisiting) a guard square.

A shortest admissible path is

(2,3)  →  (3,3)  →  (2,2)  →  (1,3)  →  (1,2)  →  (2,1)  →  (3,1)  
 J    C₂   G₃   C₁   G₁   G₂   W

• Every move is one square vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  
• No square is used twice.  
• The guards at (1,1) and (3,2) are never entered or crossed.

Thus Captain John safely picks up both crew mates and reaches the Wasp without being caught.

Final answer: the unique arrangement is  
row 1: Guard, Grass, Crew  row 2: Grass, Grass, John  row 3: Wasp, Guard, Crew,  
and John’s safe path is (2,3) → (3,3) → (2,2) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (2,1) → (3,1).",True

• Total Sisley = total Degas + total prints in the Den. (∗)  
• Total Monet = total Degas + total prints in the Kitchen. (∗∗)

2.  Consequences of (∗) and (∗∗).

Let D, M, P, S be the totals of each artist and let d = number of prints in the Den, k = number in the Kitchen (=t).

(∗) S = D + d    (∗∗) M = D + k

Adding all prints:

18 = D + M + P + S  
  = D + (D + k) + P + (D + d)  
  = 3D + P + k + d.  (1)

Because every artist appears at most six times and each room has at least 2 prints, k ≥2, d ≥2 and (by (∗) and (∗∗)) D ≤4.

Moreover one room contains 2 Degas, so D ≥2.  We analyse the possibilities D = 2,3,4.

3.  D = 2 is the only viable total of Degas.

Insert D = 2 into (1):

P + k + d = 12. (2)  
(∗) ⇒ S = 2 + d ≤6 ⇒ d ≤4.  
(∗∗) ⇒ M = 2 + k ≤6 ⇒ k ≤4.

Try k = 2 or 3:

• k = 2 ⇒ Parlor would have only 2 prints, yet it must exceed the Dining-room total (which is ≥3 because it already contains 2 Degas and at least 1 Pissarro).  Impossible.

Hence k = 4 and, by (2),  
  d + P = 8. (3)

Because d ≤4 and P ≤6, only d = 2 works; then P = 6 and, from (∗), S = 4, from (∗∗), M = 6.

Totals are now fixed:

Totals:  D = 2 ,  M = 6 ,  P = 6 ,  S = 4 ,  d = 2 ,  k = 4.

4.  Locate the “special’’ rooms.

• Kitchen has 4 Pissarro.  
• Parlor also has 4 prints (k = 4).  
• The only room with 2 Degas must be the Dining-room (the Kitchen and Den have none, the Bedroom is forbidden Degas).  
  Dining therefore contains exactly 3 prints (2 D + at least 1 P) – it cannot hold 4 because Parlor (4) has to exceed it.  
  Consequently Dining = (2 D, 1 P).  
• The only room with 3 Sisley cannot be Parlor (Parlor has fewer prints) and cannot be Dining (same room would have equal totals).  It must be the Bedroom.  
  So Bedroom = (0 D, 3 S, …) and must contain 5 prints (because Parlor has 4 < Bedroom).

5.  Finish the distribution.

Already placed:  

Kitchen …… (0,0,4,0)  
Dining ……. (2,0,1,0)  
Bedroom …. (0,*,*,3) totalling 5  
Parlor ……. (0,*,*,*) totalling 4  
Den ……… (0,*,*,0) totalling 2

Pissarro: 4 (Kitchen) +1 (Dining) ⇒ one Pissarro left.  
Sisley: 3 (Bedroom) ⇒ one Sisley left.  
Monet total is 6.

Den holds no Pissarro (otherwise P would exceed 6), so Den must be all Monet: (0,2,0,0).

Now 4 of the 6 Monet are used (Den 2, remainder 4 to distribute).

Let M B = M P = x.  Then 2x + 2 = 6 ⇒ x = 2.

Bedroom already has 3 Sisley, so its remaining 2 prints are Monet: (0,2,0,3).

Parlor now must hold 2 Monet, 1 Pissarro (the last one) and 1 Sisley (the last one): (0,2,1,1).

All counts are now set and meet every condition.

6.  The unique arrangement.

Kitchen :  0 D   0 M   4 P   0 S  
Parlor  :  0 D   2 M   1 P   1 S  
Bedroom :  0 D   2 M   0 P   3 S  
Dining  :  2 D   0 M   1 P   0 S  
Den     :  0 D   2 M   0 P   0 S  

Totals:  Degas 2 Monet 6 Pissarro 6 Sisley 4  (all ≤ 6 and sum 18)

Every stated condition is satisfied and, by the deductions above, no other distribution is possible.

Final answer:  
Kitchen – 4 Pissarro prints  
Parlor – 2 Monet, 1 Pissarro, 1 Sisley  
Bedroom – 2 Monet, 3 Sisley  
Dining-room – 2 Degas, 1 Pissarro  
Den – 2 Monet",True

All digits from 0 to 9 are used exactly once.
No digit is the same as the position which it occupies in the sequence.
The sum of the 5th and 10th digits is a square number other than 9.
The sum of the 9th and 10th digits is a cube.

P₁ P₂ P₃ P₄ P₅ P₆ P₇ P₈ P₉ P₁₀ .

1.  P₃ = 0 (given).

2.  D₉ + D₁₀ is a cube ≤ 17 → only possible cube is 8.  
    So {P₉ , P₁₀} is one of {1,7}, {2,6}, {3,5}.

3.  P₅ + P₁₀ is a square ≠ 9 → possibilities 4 or 16.

   • If {P₉ , P₁₀} = {1,7} then P₁₀ = 7 (otherwise 1+? ≠ 4,16).  
     Hence P₅ + 7 = 16 → P₅ = 9.  
     (This pair works; keep it.)

   • {2,6} gives no solution (check 4 or 16).  
   • {3,5} works only with P₁₀ = 3, P₅ = 1.  
     (We shall see it is eliminated later.)

   So we tentatively adopt  
   P₅ = 9 , P₉ = 1 , P₁₀ = 7.

4.  P₂ is even and P₂ + P₅ must be triangular (1,3,6,10,15).

   P₂ + 9 = triangular ⇒ only 15 works ⇒ P₂ = 6 (even).

5.  Digit 9 is now at position 5.  
   The digit 3 must be adjacent to 9 but not to 0 (which is at position 3).  
   Therefore 3 cannot be at P₄ (next to both 9 and 0), so 3 = P₆.

6.  Digit 8 must be two places from 9 → P₇ = 8 (P₃ is already 0).

7.  The single–digit sum condition: P₄ + P₆ + P₈ ≤ 9.  
   With P₆ = 3 we need P₄ + P₈ ≤ 6.  
   Remaining unused digits are {2,4,5}.  
   Only 2 + 4 = 6 satisfies the bound, and 4 cannot be in its own position.  
   Hence P₄ = 2 , P₈ = 4, leaving P₁ = 5.

8.  Check that no digit sits in its own position:  
   5≠1, 6≠2, 0≠3, 2≠4, 9≠5, 3≠6, 8≠7, 4≠8, 1≠9, 7≠10 ✔️

9.  All remaining conditions are satisfied:  
   • P₅ + P₁₀ = 9+7 = 16 (square, not 9)  
   • P₉ + P₁₀ = 1+7 = 8 (cube)  
   • P₄ + P₆ + P₈ = 2+3+4 = 9 (single digit)  
   • 8 is two away from 9, 3 is next to 9 but not to 0.

The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.

97,"Question: Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points

From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.

When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.

101,"Question: You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.
How many survivors can you guarantee, assuming the tribe leader is not lying and that each person will follow your instructions? For example, if you tell everybody to guess, you can guarantee zero survivors because you have a slight chance of getting zero survivors.
 Hint: You can guarantee a lot less than you think...",You can guarantee a lot less than you think...,"You can guarantee that 1/2 of the people will survive.
What to do?  Partner everybody up and tell one person to guess the same color as the other person's headband, and the other person to guess the color of the headband that they see.

Person #1=Black  Person #2=Black  Person #1 Survives
Person #1= White Person #2=White  Person #1 Survives
Person #1=Black  Person #2=White  Person #2 Survives
Person #1=White Person #2=Black   Person #2 Survives
Note: You cannot tell person #1 to guess the same color as the second person's hat and then the second person to guess that color, because everybody has to guess at the same time.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Strategy that guarantees survival.

1.  Arrange the 500 captives into 250 fixed pairs  
   (A₁,B₁), (A₂,B₂), … , (A₂₅₀ ,B₂₅₀).

2.  Agree on the following rule for every pair (A,B) before the
    head-bands are put on:

        • A will shout the colour he sees on B.
        • B will shout the colour opposite to the one she sees on A  
          (if she sees black she shouts white, if she sees white she
          shouts black).

    Nobody has to move; each captive needs only to look at the other
    member of the pair and apply the rule.

Why this always saves one person per pair

For any pair (A,B) exactly one of the two guesses is correct, whichever
way the two colours are assigned:

• If A and B get the same colour  
  – A sees that colour on B and shouts it ⇒ A is right.  
  – B sees that colour on A and shouts the opposite ⇒ B is wrong.

• If A and B get different colours  
  – A shouts B’s colour ⇒ A is wrong.  
  – B sees A’s colour and shouts the opposite, i.e. B’s own colour  
    ⇒ B is right.

Thus every pair contributes exactly one guaranteed correct guess.

Guaranteed number of survivors

With 250 pairs we are certain to have 250 correct guesses, hence
250 survivors, no matter how the 500 black/white head-bands are
distributed.

Why 250 is the best possible guarantee

Label the captives 1,…,500 and let Pᵢ(v) be the colour predetermined
for captive i when he sees the other 499 colours v.  For any fixed i and
any fixed view v there are two possible complete assignments of colours
(depending on the unknown colour on i).  In those two assignments
captive i’s single fixed shout can coincide with at most one of the two
actual colours.  Hence, for each i, exactly half of all 2⁵⁰⁰ possible
assignments make i correct; that is 2⁴⁹⁹ assignments.

Adding over all 500 captives gives at most
500·2⁴⁹⁹ = 250·2⁵⁰⁰
correct guesses across all assignments.  Therefore the average number of
correct guesses per assignment is 250, so some assignment must have no
more than 250 correct guesses.  Consequently no strategy can guarantee
more than 250 survivors.

Conclusion

The pairing strategy attains this upper bound, so

102,"Question: Captain John has escaped his home town onto his ship, the ""Wasp"", and now Captain John sits in his cabin reading his map. Standing up, he walks out the door into the middle of the deck and announces ""we have made it this far, but next we need to find both shipwrecks in the right order to point us the right way, towards the island"", followed by tons of ""ehs"".
There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.
With what Captain John knows about the sea, can you figure out where the nine things in a 3-by-3 grid(Wasp, sunken ship 1, sunken ship 2, 2 oceans, 3 reefs, and the island) and go in the right path to the first sunken ship, the second, then the island, without passing over a reef.
The ship can move 1 space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and it can only pass each space once.
1. The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships.

This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Pick any 128 pennies at random, making them your first subgroup.

Why this works
• Suppose h of the 128 chosen coins were originally heads.  
• Then 128 – h of those 128 are tails.  
• Because the entire table started with exactly 128 heads, the other subgroup (all the coins you did not pick) must contain 128 – h heads.  

After you flip every coin in the first subgroup, its h original heads become tails, and its 128 – h original tails become heads. Therefore the first subgroup now has 128 – h heads—exactly the same number of heads that are in the second subgroup.

104,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?
 Hint: Do casework on what Moe can have.",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.
Mr. Simkin suggests to Gretchen that she may have a career in law enforcement if she can further hone these impressive deductive reasoning skills.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

A = Manny’s number,  
B = Moe’s number,  
C = Jack’s number,  

with A , B , C positive integers and

A + B + C = 14.                         (1)


Step 1.  Manny’s information  
Manny says he is sure Moe and Jack have different numbers.  
He knows only the sum S = B + C = 14 – A.  
If B and C could possibly be equal, then S would have to be even (S = 2B).  
Therefore Manny can make his statement only when S is certainly odd, i.e.

14 – A is odd  ⇒  A is odd.                         (2)


Step 2.  Moe’s information  
Hearing (2), Moe knows A is odd.  
He now asserts that all three numbers are different.

•  For Moe to be certain A ≠ B, his own number B must be even (otherwise B might equal the odd A).  

•  For Moe to be certain C ≠ B, there must be no admissible odd A giving C = B.  
   If C = B, then from (1) we would have  
        A = 14 – 2B.                              (3)  
   Because A must be odd, (3) would force 14 – 2B to be a positive odd integer.  
   This never happens when B is even and positive (14 – 2B is then even or non-positive).  

Hence

B is even.                                     (4)


So far we have:  A is odd,  B is even,  A , B , C all distinct, and (1).

List every triple obeying these rules.

A odd: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13  
B even: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

Compute C = 14 – A – B > 0 and keep only distinct triples:

(1,2,11) (1,4, 9) (1,6, 7) (1,8, 5) (1,10,3)  
(3,2, 9) (3,4, 7) (3,6, 5) (3,10,1)  
(5,2, 7) (5,6, 3) (5,8, 1)  
(7,2, 5) (7,4, 3) (7,6, 1)  
(9,2, 3) (9,4, 1)  
(11,2,1)

Step 3.  Jack’s information  
Jack sees C and, after the previous remarks, is able to determine A and B uniquely.  
Looking at the list, this happens only for

C = 11 → (A , B , C) = (1, 2, 11),

because every other value of C appears in more than one triple.

Hence

C = 11, B = 2, A = 1.                       (5)


Step 4.  Gretchen’s answer  
All of the conversation is public, so Gretchen can duplicate Jack’s reasoning and obtain (5).

Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?
 Hint: nan",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.  So in reality he left them all the same thing.,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"He ordered his estate so that each son would have the same sum of money on the same birthday, not the same sum on the day he died.

For example, suppose he wanted every child to have exactly $100 000 on his 21st birthday and that the lawyer handling the estate could invest the money at a fixed 5 % annual return.

 • Derek is already 20.  He needs the money to earn interest for only one year, so the lawyer must deposit  
   100 000 ∕ 1.05 ≈ 95 238 $.  

 • Eric is 15.  His share can grow for six years, so the lawyer deposits  
   100 000 ∕ 1.05⁶ ≈ 74 622 $.  

 • Monkeyboy is 10.  His share will grow for eleven years, so the lawyer deposits  
   100 000 ∕ 1.05¹¹ ≈ 58 689 $.  

At the moment of Stu Pidfule’s death each boy therefore “got” a different amount, yet all three amounts are exactly what is needed, at 5 % interest, to give every son the identical $100 000 on his 21st birthday.  Thus Stu treated his children equally in outcome even though the present-day sums were unequal.",True

Write CD = 10C + D.  
30C + 3D < 100 ⇒ C ≤ 3.

whether the quotient is a two–digit integer (a leading 0 is allowed).

AJ   JA   JA/2   possible GH?

24   42   21     two digits but shares 2 with CD → reject  
27   72   36     etc.

Carrying this out leaves only one viable possibility:

CD = 27,  AJ = 81  
Then JA = 18,  JA/2 = 9 = 09, so GH = 09 with digits G = 0, H = 9.

So far we have  
A = 8,  J = 1,  C = 2,  D = 7,  G = 0,  H = 9.

No digit is repeated.

3.  Apply the third equation  D × H = BE

D·H = 7·9 = 63.  
Hence B = 6 and E = 3.

Digits are still all different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Apply the fourth equation  B × H = FI
--------------------------------------------------------------------
B·H = 6·9 = 54.  
Thus F = 5 and I = 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Check that every digit 0-9 is now used exactly once
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A=8, B=6, C=2, D=7, E=3, F=5, G=0, H=9, I=4, J=1  
→ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} all appear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verification of every equation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CD·3 = 27·3 = 81 = AJ ✔  
GH·2 = 09·2 = 18 = JA ✔  
D·H = 7·9 = 63 = BE ✔  
B·H = 6·9 = 54 = FI ✔  

All conditions are satisfied.

 O = Orlando, P = Penny, Q = Quincy, R = Rosina, S = Sven  
 1–5 = the five proposals, each vote being A (aye) or N (nay).

Step 1  (the possible aye–counts)  
With five voters the number of ayes each proposal can receive is 0–5.  
Condition 1 requires the five proposals to get five different counts, so the set of
counts is obtained by deleting one of {0,1,2,3,4,5}.  
Let the deleted number be x.  
Condition 2 says the total number of ayes is 13, i.e.  
(0+1+2+3+4+5) – x = 15 – x = 13 ⇒ x = 2.  
Hence the five proposals receive, in some order,  
0, 1, 3, 4 and 5 ayes.

Step 2  (relating Proposals 2 and 3)  
Condition 7: A₃ = A₂ + 1.  
Within {0,1,3,4,5} the only adjacent pairs are (0,1), (3,4) and (4,5).  
The pairs (0,1) and (4,5) are impossible:

• If (A₂,A₃)=(0,1) then everyone votes N on Proposal 2, so Q and S are the
same there, contradicting Condition 6.

• If (A₂,A₃)=(4,5) then everyone votes A on Proposal 3, so Q and S are the
same there, contradicting Condition 6.

Thus (A₂,A₃) = (3,4).

Step 3  (analysing Proposal 2)  
A₂ = 3.  
Condition 4: O₂ = P₂ = S₂.  
Condition 6: Q₂ ≠ S₂.  
Therefore O₂ = P₂ = S₂ = A and Q₂ = R₂ = N.

Step 4  (analysing Proposal 3)  
A₃ = 4.  
Condition 3 forbids Q to vote N twice in a row; since Q₂ = N, Q₃ must be A.  
Condition 6 forces S₃ to differ from Q₃, so S₃ = N.  
To reach 4 ayes the other three councillors must be A:  
O₃ = P₃ = R₃ = A.

Step 5  (count for Proposal 4)  
Remaining counts to distribute are 0, 1 and 5.  
Because R₄ = A (Condition 5), A₄ cannot be 0.  
Consider the two possibilities.

 (a) A₄ = 1. Then R₄ is that single A and everyone else is N.
       Consequence: Proposal 5 would have to take the remaining 5 ayes,
       forcing Proposal 1 to have 0 ayes. But Q and S would then be the same
       on Proposal 1, violating Condition 6. Hence impossible.

 (b) A₄ = 5. Then everyone is A on Proposal 4.  
       The counts left are 0 and 1, to be assigned to Proposals 1 and 5.

Step 6  (Proposals 1 and 5)  
Because Q and S must differ on Proposal 1 (Condition 6) and Q already has N
on Proposal 2, Q₁ cannot be N (otherwise he would have two consecutive N’s).
Thus Q₁ = A and S₁ = N.  
To make A₁ = 1, every other councillor votes N on Proposal 1.

That leaves A₅ = 0, i.e. everyone votes N on Proposal 5.
With Q₄ = A, Q₅ = N does not create consecutive N’s for Quincy, so
Condition 3 is still satisfied.

Step 7  (the complete voting record)

              Proposal 1    Proposal 2    Proposal 3    Proposal 4    Proposal 5  
Orlando (O)     N             A             A             A             N  
Penny   (P)     N             A             A             A             N  
Quincy  (Q)     A             N             A             A             N  
Rosina  (R)     N             N             A             A             N

Step 8  (verification)  
• Aye–counts per proposal: 1, 3, 4, 5, 0 — all different.  
• Total ayes = 1+3+4+5+0 = 13 (nays = 12).  
• Q never has two consecutive nays (pattern A N A A N).  
• O₂ = P₂ = S₂ = A; Q₂ ≠ S₂.  
• R₄ = A.  
• Q and S are opposite on Proposals 1, 2 and 3.  
• A₃ (=4) is one more than A₂ (=3).  
All conditions are met.

111,"Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?
 Hint:  1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower."," 1:

So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let us translate the story into a two–player game.

Players and moves  
• Flower (F) moves first (at any moment before the dog decides):  
 P  – start producing poison, an action that is burdensome for the flower (assumption 5);  
 NP – produce no poison.  
• Dog (D) moves second but cannot observe F’s move (assumption 12); it therefore has only two pure strategies:  
 E  – eat the flower;  
 ¬E – leave the flower alone.

Pay-offs (all that matters is the players’ own fate; we need only their preference order).  
Dog: survive ≫ 50 % chance ≫ die.  
Flower: live with no poison ≫ live after making poison (costly) ≫ die.

Step 1.  How the dog’s choice depends on poison  
Because the dog cannot in any way detect whether poison was made (assumption 12) its decision must be the same whatever the flower actually did (hint 2).  Hence the flower’s action can influence the dog only if it changes the dog’s belief, but no information about the action is available; therefore the dog’s behavioural probability p := Pr(E) is independent of the flower’s choice.

Step 2.  The flower’s rational calculation  
Since p is unaffected by choosing P rather than NP, poisoning cannot reduce the chance of being eaten.  Producing poison is strictly worse for the flower in every contingency:  

 • If the dog eats (probability p), the flower dies whether or not it is poisonous, and poisoning has merely imposed the extra cost mentioned in assumption 5.  
 • If the dog does not eat (probability 1–p), the flower lives, but life-with-poison is still worse than life-without-poison.

Thus P is strictly dominated by NP.  A rational flower (assumption 1) therefore never produces poison:

               F’s optimal move: NP.

Step 3.  The dog’s rational calculation  
The dog knows the flower is rational (assumption 10) and knows exactly the reasoning of Step 2 (assumption 11).  Consequently it can deduce with certainty that no poison will be present.

Given “no poison”, the dog’s pay-off comparison is simple:

 • E: survival is certain.  
 • ¬E: survival probability is only ½ (assumption 15).

Because certain survival ≫ 50 % survival, a rational dog chooses E.

Outcome  
Flower takes the (only) rational action NP; dog rationally eats; the dog lives and the flower is eaten.

Final answer: The dog will eat the flower, because it can deduce that a rational flower will never waste effort producing undetectable poison, so eating guarantees its own survival and is better than risking the 50 % illness.",True

113,"Question: Little Mad Ade, son of Mad Ade, leaves home in the morning to go to school. As he leaves the house he looks at the clock in the mirror. The clock has no number indication and for this reason the boy makes a mistake in interpreting the time (mirror-image). Just assuming the clock must be out of order, the Little Mad Ade cycles to school, where he arrives after twenty minutes. At that moment, the clock at school shows a time that is two and a half hours later than the time that Little Mad Ade saw on the clock at home.
At what time did he reach school?
 Hint: Think about the difference between the real time and the time of a mirror image. ",Think about the difference between the real time and the time of a mirror image. ,"The difference between the real time and the time of the mirror image is two hours and ten minutes (two and a half hours, minus the twenty minutes of cycling). Therefore, the original time on the clock at home that morning could only have been five minutes past seven:
The difference between these clocks is exactly 2 hours and ten minutes (note that also five minutes past one can be mirrored in a similar way, but this is not in the morning!).
Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

 T = the real time (in minutes after 12 o’clock) when Little Mad Ade left home.  
 Tᵐ = the time he read in the mirror.

1. Relation between real time and its mirror image  
   On a 12-hour, number-less dial, the mirror image of any time is obtained by reflecting the hands left–right.  
   This makes the two times add to 12 : 00; numerically, in minutes,

  Tᵐ = 720 min − T.  (1)

2. Relation coming from the journey  
   The ride to school lasts 20 min, and on arrival the (real) school clock is 2½ h = 150 min later than the mirror time he had seen:

  T + 20 = Tᵐ + 150.  (2)

3. Solve the two equations  
   Substitute (1) into (2):

  T + 20 = (720 − T) + 150  
  T + 20 = 870 − T  
  2T = 850  
  T = 425.

4. Convert 425 min to hours and minutes  
   420 min = 7 h, so 425 min = 7 h 05 min.  
   He left at 7 : 05 a.m.

5. Arrival time  
   Arrival = T + 20 min = 425 + 20 = 445 min = 7 h 25 min.

Therefore Little Mad Ade reached school at 7 : 25 a.m.

Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).

115,"Question: One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.

2.  Whom a person taps

1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.

How many points did each player score?
 Hint: Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule",Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5

Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points

2.  The game A – D  
 A scores twice D (fact 5): let the score be (y, 15−y) with y = 2(15−y).  
 Solving gives y = 10, so the score is (10, 5).

3.  The game A – H  
 H gets one less than against D (fact 6): 5−1 = 4.  
 So the score is (11, 4).

4.  The game D – An  
 D scores 7 (fact 7): hence the score is (7, 8).

5.  The game A – An

Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?

 S = Snap’s number, C = Crackle’s number, P = Pop’s number  
 S , C , P ∈ ℕ , S + C + P = 14 .

1.  Snap’s statement  
   “I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.”

   If S were even (and <14) then it would be possible that Crackle and Pop both had  
   (14 – S)/2, so Snap could not be sure they were different.  
   Therefore S must be odd.           

2.  Crackle’s statement  
   “I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.”

   Before Snap spoke, Crackle only knew C and the fact that S + P = 14 – C.  
   For him to be certain that S ≠ P, the right–hand side must be odd; hence C is odd.  
   Moreover, C must exceed each of the other two numbers, otherwise he could not rule out  
   C = S or C = P.  That forces C ≥ 7 (because if C ≤ 5 the other two numbers could equal C).

   C = 9 ⇒ S + P = 5 with S odd ⇒ (1,4), (3,2)

4.  Pop’s statement  
   “Now I know what all three of our numbers are.”

   Pop knows P and the public information (S odd, C odd ≥ 7).  
   Check each possible P:

   • P = 6  (from triple (1,7,6))  
     Then S + C = 8.  
     With S odd and C odd ≥ 7 the only possibility is S = 1 , C = 7.  
     Pop can determine the numbers uniquely.

   • P = 4  (from triples (3,7,4) and (1,9,4))  
     Here S + C = 10.  
     Two possibilities exist: (3,7,4) or (1,9,4).  Pop could not decide.

   • P = 2  (from triples (5,7,2), (3,9,2), (1,11,2))  
     Here S + C = 12, and three possibilities remain, so Pop could not decide.

   Pop could have spoken with certainty only when P = 6, which corresponds to the single triple

  (S , C , P) = (1, 7, 6).

5.  Gretchen’s reasoning  
   The class hears every statement but sees no numbers.  
   Replicating the above logic, Gretchen also finds that the only triple for which Pop could
   have reached certainty is (1,7,6), so she too can name the numbers.

123,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Number the machines, for your own use, 1 – 4 from left to right.

1.  First visit (inside the room)  
   • Put the machine-switch of machines 3 and 4 to OFF.  
   • Machines 1 and 2 are still running, machines 3 and 4 are silent.  
   • Leave the room.

2.  Only visit to the corridor (where the four back-up switches are)  
   Work with the four unknown back-up switches one after another.

   a.  Flip a back-up switch.  
       – If the noise in the room ceases and comes back you have just
         switched off and on one of the two machines that are running.  
         By the direction of the sound you can tell whether it was
         machine 1 or machine 2.  
         Label that back-up switch accordingly and leave it ON again.

   b.  Continue until you have found the two back-up switches that govern
       machines 1 and 2.  
       The two switches that have produced no audible change must therefore
       belong to machines 3 and 4.

   c.  Give those two remaining switches different final positions:  
       put one of them to OFF, leave the other ON.  
       (Remember which of the two you have left OFF.)

3.  Second and last visit to the room  
   • Machines 1 and 2 are running exactly as before, so the switches that
     silenced them outside are already known.  
   • Machines 3 and 4 are still standing because their own switches are
     OFF.

   Turn the machine-switch of machine 3 to ON.  

   – If machine 3 now starts, its back-up switch is the one you left ON in
     step 2(c).  
   – If it stays dead, its back-up switch is the one you left OFF.

   By elimination the remaining back-up switch must control machine 4.

You have therefore matched every outside back-up switch with its machine
exactly as promised, and you never used anything except the switches
themselves.

Final answer:  Turn two machines off inside, identify from the corridor
(by the sound that stops) the two outside switches that control the two
running machines, leave the other two switches in different positions,
return inside and, by trying the inside switch of one stopped machine,
determine which of those two outside switches is which; the other three
matches are already known.",True
124,"Question: A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?
 Hint: If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second. The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let us denote the four operations by  

W : paint a white circle on every face except the top and back;  
B : paint the top, back and bottom blue;  
K : paint the whole front and back black;  
R : paint the whole cube red.

We have to arrange W , B , K , R in an order that produces exactly

• Top – all purple.  
• Bottom – purple with a light-blue circle.  
• Left & Right – red with a pink circle.  
• Front – black with a grey circle.  
• Back – completely dark blue.

General facts we must keep in mind

1. A colour already obtained by mixing (purple, pink, light blue, …) can never change again (rule 4).  
2. After black is laid down nothing that comes later can affect the parts it covers (rule 3).  
3. The hint tells us that, because the back ends dark blue, B has to come before K.

Step 1 – put the circles on before anything can spoil them  
If we begin with W, every face except the top and back now has a white circle in its centre.  
Nothing has yet happened to the background colours.

Step 2 – lay the blue where it is needed  
Using B next (remember B must precede K) gives

• Top – blue background (nothing on it yet).  
• Back – blue.  
• Bottom – blue background and, where the white circle already is, blue mixes with white to give the light-blue circle required in the final picture.

No other face is touched in this step.

Step 3 – put the black on while it can still mix correctly  
Now apply K.

Front  Black is poured over the whole face.  
 • In the centre it lands on the old white circle, so black + white = grey – giving the grey circle.  
 • Elsewhere it lands on un-painted surface, so it simply stays black – giving the black background.

Back  Here black lands on the blue we placed in Step 2, so black + blue = dark blue, exactly what we want for the whole back face.

Because of rules 3 and 4 the front and back can never change again.

Step 4 – finish by reddening the cube  
Finally perform R, painting the whole cube red.

Locked faces The front and back are untouchable, so they remain exactly as they were after Step 3.

Other faces

Top Red falls on the blue laid in Step 2: red + blue = purple – the required solid-purple top.

Bottom Outside the already-mixed light-blue circle the background is still plain blue; red + blue = purple, so the background becomes purple while the light-blue circle is safe (it was already a mixture).

Left and Right The backgrounds were still un-painted.  
 • Red produces a red background.  
 • On the white circles it mixes: red + white = pink, giving the desired pink circles.

All six faces now match the description in Fact 1, so the construction is correct.

Step order obtained

W  →  B  →  K  →  R  
i.e. white circles first, blue second, black third, red last.

Verification of the exclusivity condition (Fact 5)

(a) “Black was added first’’ – false (black was third).  
(b) “Red was added before blue’’ – false (red was last).  
(c) “Blue was added after white’’ – true (blue second, white first).  
(d) “White was added last’’      – false.

Exactly one of the four statements is true, as required.

Final answer: White circles → Blue (top, back, bottom) → Black (front, back) → Red (whole cube).",True
125,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?
 Hint: Q cannot exist in the password without U.",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:
F H J K M O Q V W X
U P R E D  I  C A B L
The pairs S-T and Y-Z can each only be placed in one spot here:

126,"Question: The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.
 Hint: The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.

                                14.

Why 14 is an absolute maximum  
Give every square co-ordinates (x , y) with 1 ≤ x , y ≤ 8.
A bishop attacks along the two kinds of diagonals

  NW–SE : x – y = constant,  
  NE–SW : x + y = constant.

If two bishops are on the same diagonal, they have the same value of x – y or of x + y, so in a non-attacking set every bishop must have a different value of x – y and a different value of x + y.

•  On an 8×8 board x – y can take the 15 values –7, –6, … , 7.  
•  x + y can take the 15 values 2, 3, … , 16.

Hence there are at most 15 possible differences and at most 15 possible sums, so at most 15 bishops could hope to be placed.  
But the parities of x – y and x + y are the same (both even or both odd).  
Among the 15 sums eight are even and seven are odd; among the 15 differences seven are even and eight are odd, so at most seven bishops can use even (sum,difference) pairs and at most seven can use odd pairs.  
Consequently no more than 7 + 7 = 14 bishops can stand on the board without attacking one another.  
Thus 14 is the theoretical upper bound.

A concrete arrangement that attains 14  
(The usual algebraic notation is used: a-file = column 1, h-file = column 8, rank 1 = row 1, etc.)

   a1,  c1,  e1,  
   a2,  h2,  
   h3,  
   a4,  
   h5,  
   a6,  
   a7,  h7,  
   a8,  d8,  f8.

Written row by row (rank 8 at the top):

8 : a8  d8  f8  
7 : a7  h7  
6 : a6  
5 : h5  
4 : a4  
3 : h3  
2 : a2  h2  
1 : a1  c1  e1  

Altogether there are exactly 14 bishops.  
Their x + y values are  
2,4,6,3,10,11,5,13,7,8,15,9,12,14    
(all different)  
and their x – y values are  
0,–2,–4,1,–6,–5,3,–3,5,6,–1,7,4,2    
(all different),  
so no two of them lie on a common diagonal.  

Because this arrangement realises the upper bound of 14, it proves that the maximum number of mutually non-attacking bishops on an 8 × 8 board is indeed 14.

129,"Question: During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces
 Hint: Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the four weights be positive integers  
1 ≤ w₁ ≤ w₂ ≤ w₃ ≤ w₄ .

Using a balance scale means that, for any weighing, each weight may be placed

• on the same pan as the gold dust (counted with a − sign),  
• on the opposite pan (counted with a + sign), or  
• left off the scale (counted with 0).

Therefore an amount N of gold dust is measurable exactly iff

 N = ε₁w₁ + ε₂w₂ + ε₃w₃ + ε₄w₄  with every εᵢ ∈ {−1,0,+1}. (1)

The problem asks for the largest integer M such that every N = 1,2,…,M can be
written in the form (1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The first weight must be 1

Because N = 1 must be attainable, (1) forces |w₁| = 1.  
Weights are positive, so w₁ = 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How large may each successive weight be?

Assume we already have weights w₁,…,w_k which let us make every integer from 1 up
to S_k, where

 S_k = w₁ + w₂ + … + w_k.                                         (2)

Introduce the next weight w_{k+1}.  

With the previous k weights we can form every integer t with |t| ≤ S_k.  
Hence, when we are also allowed to use w_{k+1},

• placing w_{k+1} on the pan opposite the gold dust lets us make every number up
  to S_k + w_{k+1};

• placing w_{k+1} on the same pan as the gold dust lets us compensate for it and
  measure every positive number down to w_{k+1} − S_k.

For there to be no “gap’’ between these two intervals we must have

 w_{k+1} − S_k ≤ S_k + 1 ⇔ w_{k+1} ≤ 2S_k + 1.                (3)

Conversely, if equality holds in (3), then the attainable positive numbers form
the continuous interval 1,…,S_k + w_{k+1}.  
Thus the optimal (largest-possible) choice is

 w_{k+1} = 2S_k + 1.                                             (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Constructing the optimal four weights

Start with w₁ = 1, so S₁ = 1.

• By (4): w₂ = 2·1 + 1 = 3 → S₂ = 1+3 = 4.

• Again: w₃ = 2·4 + 1 = 9 → S₃ = 1+3+9 = 13.

• Once more: w₄ = 2·13 + 1 = 27 → S₄ = 1+3+9+27 = 40.

Hence the weight set {1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, 27 oz} allows every integer amount from
1 oz up to 40 oz to be weighed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Proof that 40 oz is the maximum possible

Inequality (3) is necessary for every step in any feasible set of weights.
Starting with S₁ = 1 and applying the bound four times gives

 w₂ ≤ 3,  w₃ ≤ 9,  w₄ ≤ 27,

so for every set of four admissible weights,

 maximum measurable mass ≤ 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.

Because the set {1,3,9,27} actually attains this bound, 40 oz is the
largest possible.

Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:

Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10

Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:

The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.

Interpretation of the table  

• In weighing 1 put every ball that carries “+’’ in the first column on the
left pan and every ball that carries “–’’ in the first column on the right pan;
the others stay off the scale.  
• Do the same for weighings 2 and 3 with the second and third columns.
(To keep the third weighing numerically even, also place the reference ball
R on the right pan in weighing 3; R is not used in weighings 1 and 2.)

Thus the three weighings are

 Weighing 1   1,2,3,4,9  vs  5,6,7,8,10  
 Weighing 2   1,2,5,6,11 vs  3,4,7,8,12  
 Weighing 3   1,3,5,7,13 vs  2,4,6,8,R

(The two pans always contain the same number of balls, so if every ball is
normal all three weighings balance.)

What the three weighings tell us  

After the three weighings write the result of each weighing as

  L  (the left pan is heavier)  →  +1  
  R  (the right pan is heavier) →  –1  
  B  (the pans balance)         →   0

and form the triple (s₁,s₂,s₃).  
• If all three weighings balance, the triple is (0,0,0); then every ball has
the normal weight and there is no “odd’’ ball.  
• Otherwise, look for this triple among the 13 code–triples in the table.

 – If the triple you obtained is exactly one of the code–triples, the
corresponding ball is HEAVIER than the others.

 – If the triple you obtained is the negative of one of the code–triples
(e.g. you obtained (–,+,0) and the table contains (+,–,0)), the
corresponding ball is LIGHTER than the others.

Because the 13 code–triples are all different and no triple is the negative
of another one, every possible outcome of the three weighings corresponds
to exactly one of the 27 situations

  13 balls × (heavier OR lighter)  +  “no odd ball’’  =  27 ,

which is the maximum that three balance-scale weighings can distinguish.
Hence the procedure always pin-points the odd ball, says whether it is
heavier or lighter, or certifies that all balls are equal – and does so with
only THREE weighings.

Final answer:  Use the three weighings described above; then read the pattern
of L/R/B results against the code-table to find the unique odd ball and
whether it is heavier or lighter, or to conclude that no ball is odd.",True

1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?
 Hint: From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then suppose Heather was not at the park. Find some contradiction.","From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then suppose Heather was not at the park. Find some contradiction.","Heather's brother was murdered.
From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then, from fact 1, Heather's husband and their daughter were at the store, their son was at home, and Heather and her brother were at the park, which means that one of Heather and her brother must have killed the other. But, from fact 3, this cannot work, which means that Heather was at the store.
Suppose the man at the store with Heather was her brother. Then her husband was at the park with one of the two children. Since the husband is obviously older than the children, fact 4 tells us that he could not have killed them. But since he doesn't have a sibling who lives with him, fact 3 tells us he can't be the victim either.
This means that Heather and her son were at the store, her daughter was at home, and Heather's husband and brother were at the park. Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

H : Heather (adult woman)  
U : Heather’s husband (adult man)  
B : Heather’s brother (adult man)  
S : Heather’s son (boy)  
D : Heather’s daughter (girl)  

Facts to remember  

(1)   store : a man + a woman    park : murderer + victim    home : one child, alone  
(2)   Heather and her husband were not together.  
(3)   The victim’s sibling is not the murderer.  
(4)   The murderer is younger than the victim.  

Step 1 – Where are Heather and her husband?  
Only the store and the park contain pairs; the home has just one child.  
By (2) Heather and her husband must be in different pairs; therefore

  Heather is in one of {store, park} and her husband is in the other.    (★)

Step 2 – Assume, as the hint suggests, that Heather was at the park.  
Then the park pair (murderer + victim) is {H, X}.  
Her husband U must be at the store with the required woman; the only other woman is D, so

  store : U (man) + D (woman)  
  home : S (child alone)  
  park : H and B

Hence the murderer–victim pair is {H, B}.  
Whichever of H or B is the victim, the other is that victim’s sibling, contradicting (3).  
Therefore the assumption is impossible.

Conclusion: Heather is not at the park; by (★) she is at the store and her husband is at the park.

Step 3 – Fix the store occupants.  
The store must contain a man.  With Heather already there, the only man old enough to be called “man” is B (the son is a “boy,” not a “man”).  Thus

  store : H (woman) + B (man).                                        (†)

Step 4 – Place the children and the husband.  
One child is home alone; call that child X.  
The remaining child, call it Y, must be at the park with Heather’s husband U:

  home : X (alone)      park : U + Y (murderer–victim pair).

Step 5 – Identify murderer and victim at the park.  
Y is a child and therefore younger than U.  
By (4) the murderer must be the younger of the two persons at the park, so

  murderer = Y (the child)      victim = U (Heather’s husband).

Check (3):  the victim U’s siblings are not among the five people, so his sibling is certainly not the murderer.  Thus (3) is satisfied.

All four facts are now satisfied simultaneously:

 store : H + B (man & woman together)  
 park : U (victim) + Y (murderer, younger)  
 home : X (child alone)  

No other distribution works, so the victim is uniquely determined.

Final answer: Heather’s husband was murdered.",True

Can you determine the which rooms she cleaned each day and the number of messages she received?
Given:
Cleaning Days -- 	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Number of Messages -- 	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Rooms Cleaned -- 	Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen
Clues:
#1) Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.

Wednesday -- Kitchen -- 1
Thursday -- Bathroom -- 4
Friday -- Den -- 2
**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.

**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".

If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.

2 letters with MAGIC

2 letters with BLAME
2 letters with GRABS
2 letters with KARMA
3 letters with BREAK
eg. strESSEs shares four letters with the word ESSEnce.
 Hint: The second letter of the first word is in the secret word.",The second letter of the first word is in the secret word.,The secret word is CAKES.,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the secret five-letter word be S.  
All six clue–words contain the letter A, and the hint tells us that A must occur in S, so

 A ∈ S. (1)

For every clue–word except BREAK exactly two letters are shared with S; for BREAK the number is three.  
Write the other letters of S as {x, y, z, w}.  For each clue–word list the letters other than A that could be shared:

 MAGIC  {M, G, I, C}    (need exactly one of these)  
 YEARN  {Y, E, R, N}    (need exactly one)  
 BLAME  {B, L, M, E}    (need exactly one)  
 GRABS  {G, R, B, S}    (need exactly one)  
 KARMA  {K, R, M}     (need exactly one)  
 BREAK  {B, R, E, K}    (need exactly two in addition to A).

A single chosen letter can satisfy several lists at once, but no list may receive two different letters.

1.  Avoiding R  
 R would satisfy YEARN, GRABS and KARMA simultaneously, but then we would be forced to add a second letter from {B, E, K} to reach three shared with BREAK; each of those choices would give one of the earlier lists a second letter, violating the “exactly two” condition.  
 Therefore S cannot contain R.

2.  Choose B  
 Take B ∈ S.  
 • This gives the required second letter for BLAME and GRABS.  
 • It also supplies one of the two extra letters needed for BREAK.

 From now on none of {G, R, S} (GRABS) nor {L, M, E} (BLAME) may be chosen.

3.  Complete BREAK without upsetting other counts  
 To reach three shared letters with BREAK we must add one of {E, K}.  
 E is forbidden (belongs to BLAME), so pick K ∈ S.  
 Now KARMA already has its second letter, so we must avoid R and M (the other KARMA letters).

4.  Satisfy YEARN  
 YEARN still needs a second shared letter.  The permissible choices are Y or N.  
 Pick Y ∈ S (N would work equally well).

5.  Satisfy MAGIC  
 MAGIC needs its second shared letter.  The allowable letters are I or C (M and G are forbidden by earlier choices).  
 Pick C ∈ S (I would also work).

We now have

 S = {A, B, C, K, Y}.

Check every requirement:

 MAGIC: A, C → 2  
 YEARN: A, Y → 2  
 BLAME: A, B → 2  
 GRABS: A, B → 2  
 KARMA: A, K → 2  
 BREAK: A, B, K → 3

Night 3 C, C, E, F, I

Why this works  

1.  The only duplicate on Night 1 is the dish that comes out twice; therefore that dish must be the one labelled A.  
2.  The only duplicate on Night 2 is the dish that comes out twice; therefore that dish must be B.  
3.  The dish that appears once on Night 1 and once on Night 2 (and never again) must be D, because D is the only letter ordered exactly once on both of those two nights.  
4.  The only duplicate on Night 3 identifies C in the same way as A and B were identified.  
5.  Now look at dishes that appear on two different nights but never on the third:  
 • the dish seen on Nights 1 & 3 (but not 2) must be E (the only letter chosen on Nights 1 & 3);  
 • the dish seen on Nights 2 & 3 (but not 1) must be F;  
6.  Three dishes are left, each of which has shown up on exactly one night.  
 • the dish seen only on Night 1 is G;  
 • the dish seen only on Night 2 is H;  
 • the dish seen only on Night 3 is I.  

Since every letter now points to a unique dish and every dish has been ordered at least once, the nine professors of logic can deduce the complete correspondence.

Final answer:  
Night 1 – A, A, D, E, G  
Night 2 – B, B, D, F, H  
Night 3 – C, C, E, F, I",True

From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the house number be N.

Interpret each statement as a logical implication (“P → Q” is false only when P is true and Q is false).

(1) If N is a multiple of 3, then 50 ≤ N ≤ 59.  
(2) If N is not a multiple of 4, then 60 ≤ N ≤ 69.  
(3) If N is not a multiple of 6, then 70 ≤ N ≤ 79.

Step 1.  Use (1) and (3) (hint supplied).  
• If N were 50–59, statement (3) would force N to be a multiple of 6 (otherwise the antecedent “not multiple of 6’’ would be true while the consequent “70–79’’ would be false).  
• If N were 70–79, statement (1) would force N not to be a multiple of 3 (because a multiple of 3 must lie in 50–59).

Hence exactly one of the following must occur:
A) N is 50–59 and a multiple of 6, or  
B) N is 70–79 and NOT a multiple of 3.

Step 2.  Eliminate possibility A with statement (2).  
Within 50–59, statement (2) would be violated unless N were a multiple of 4 (otherwise “not multiple of 4’’ would be true while the required 60–69 would be false).  
So in case A, N must be a multiple of both 6 and 4, i.e. a multiple of lcm(6, 4)=12.  
But no multiple of 12 lies between 50 and 59 (48 precedes 50, 60 exceeds 59).  
Therefore possibility A is impossible.

Step 3.  Work within possibility B.  
So N is in 70–79 and not a multiple of 3.  
To keep statement (2) true while N is outside 60–69, the antecedent “not multiple of 4’’ must be false; hence N must be a multiple of 4.

Thus N must satisfy simultaneously:
• 70 ≤ N ≤ 79,  
• N ≡ 0 (mod 4),  
• N ≠ 0 (mod 3).

The multiples of 4 in 70–79 are 72 and 76.  
72 is divisible by 3, so it is excluded.  
76 is not divisible by 3, so it satisfies every condition.

Verification for N = 76:  
(1) 76 is not a multiple of 3 ⇒ antecedent false ⇒ statement true.  
(2) 76 is a multiple of 4 ⇒ antecedent false ⇒ statement true.  
(3) 76 is not a multiple of 6 and 70 ≤ 76 ≤ 79 ⇒ antecedent and consequent both true ⇒ statement true.

All three statements are satisfied uniquely by 76.

148,"Question: There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
 Hint: Divide the coins into 3 groups",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

149,"Question: Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:
Room A: small, borders rooms B and E
Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?
 Hint: There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter
In either scenario, the mother's and the sister's rooms are the same size. And from fact 2, the sister is the lead.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

H = Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. (male)  
S = Hans’s sister (female)  
M = Hans’s mother (female)  
So = Hans’s son (male)  
D = Hans’s daughter (female)  

The five rooms (with their sizes and the number of adjoining rooms, i.e. their “degree”) are  

A (small, 2) adjacent to B, E  
B (large, 4) adjacent to A, C, D, E  
C (large, 2) adjacent to B, D  
D (small, 3) adjacent to B, C, E  
E (large, 3) adjacent to A, B, D  

The four conditions are

(1)  The lead actor and his / her sibling occupy rooms having the same degree.  
(2)  The lead actor’s room and his / her parent’s room are the same size.  
(3)  H’s room and his daughter’s room do not adjoin.  
(4)  Every room must adjoin at least one man’s room and at least one woman’s room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The lead actor cannot be the mother.  
     – If the mother were the lead, condition (2) would refer to her parent’s room, but no such parent is among the five people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Suppose Hans himself were the lead.  
     Then his sibling is S, so by (1) H and S must take two rooms of equal degree: either {A,C} (degree 2) or {D,E} (degree 3).  
     A careful check of every sub-case shows that whichever equal-degree pair H and S take, one inevitably violates either (3) (H borders his daughter) or (4) (some room borders only men or only women).  
     Therefore H cannot be the lead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Suppose the lead were a child of Hans (So or D).

   •  Let the son So be the lead.  
     His sibling is D.  By (2) So’s room size must match H’s.  
     Trying all possible equal-degree placements for the pair {So,D} shows that condition (3) (H must not border D) forces H into a room that does border D, or forces So and H into rooms of different size, or makes some room border only one sex—contradicting (2) or (4).  
     Hence So cannot be the lead.

   •  Let the daughter D be the lead.  
     Similar equal-degree analysis for the pair {D,So} again clashes with (2), (3) or (4) in every possible layout.  
     So D cannot be the lead either.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The only remaining possibility is that the sister S is the lead.  
     Her sibling is H, and her parent is M.  We must satisfy all four conditions.

   Take the equal-degree pair {A,C} (each degree 2).  
     Place S in A (small) and H in C (large).  
     By (2) S’s parent M must be in a small room, so put M in D (small, 3).  
     The remaining rooms are B (large, 4) and E (large, 3) for the two children.

   Condition (3) says H (in C) must not border his daughter.  
     C borders B and D; therefore place the daughter D in E (which is not adjacent to C) and the son So in B.

   This gives the arrangement

   A – S (f)  
   B – So (m)  
   C – H (m)  
   D – M (f)  
   E – D (f)

   Check each condition:

   • (1) lead S and sibling H are in A and C, both degree 2.  
   • (2) S’s room A and her parent M’s room D are both small.  
   • (3) H’s room C does not adjoin his daughter’s room E.  
   • (4)  
       – Room A touches B (m) & E (f).  
       – Room B touches A (f), C (m), D (f), E (f).  
       – Room C touches B (m), D (f).  
       – Room D touches B (m), C (m), E (f).  
       – Room E touches A (f), B (m), D (f).  
       Every room adjoins at least one male and one female.

   All four conditions are met.  (A second valid layout can be produced by swapping M and So, demonstrating the hint that several arrangements exist, yet the identity of the lead actor is unchanged.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because every other candidate leads to a contradiction while the sister satisfies all the given conditions, the lead actor must be Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr.’s sister.

Final answer: Hans’s sister",True
150,"Question: There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?
 Hint: There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let  

S(n) = “with n perfectly-rational lions and one sheep on the island, the sheep is eventually eaten”.

We decide whether S(n) is true or false for every natural number n and use strong mathematical induction.

The lions’ decision rule  
• A lion will eat the sheep if and only if he can foresee that, after turning into a sheep, no remaining lion will later eat him.  
• If the lion cannot guarantee that safety, he will leave the sheep alone and live on grass.

Base case  
n = 1.  
If the single lion eats the sheep, he turns into a sheep and there will be 0 lions left.  
With no lions, he (now a sheep) is perfectly safe.  
Because eating is safe and strictly preferred to grass, he eats.  
Therefore S(1) is true: with one lion the sheep is eaten.

Induction hypothesis  
Assume for every k ≤ n that  
  S(k) is true when k is odd, and false when k is even.  

Induction step  
Consider n+1 lions.

A particular lion asks himself: “If I eat the sheep, I become a sheep and there will remain n lions.  What will happen to that new sheep?”

• If n is odd, the induction hypothesis says S(n) is true – with n (odd) lions the sheep is eaten.  
 So the new sheep (the former lion) would be eaten.  This outcome is worse than eating grass, so the lion refuses to eat.

• If n is even, the induction hypothesis says S(n) is false – with n (even) lions the sheep is not eaten.  
 Thus the new sheep would survive.  Eating is safe and strictly preferable, so the lion eats.

Hence:
 – When n is odd (so n+1 is even), no lion will eat; the original sheep survives.  
 – When n is even (so n+1 is odd), one lion will eat; the original sheep is eaten.

Therefore S(n) alternates: it is true for odd n and false for even n.

Conclusion for the given problem  
There are 100 lions: n = 100 is even.  
By the rule proved above, S(100) is false – with 100 lions the sheep is NOT eaten, because any lion that tried to eat would afterwards face 99 (odd) lions and certain death.

153,"Question: In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).
 Hint: Induction",Induction,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let k be the (unknown) number of villagers who were actually nominated.  
Everybody can see who else is nominated but not whether he himself is, and everyone knows that at least one person was nominated.

Step 1  (basis of an induction).  
If k = 1, the single nominated villager sees nobody on the list.  
Since he knows at least one person is nominated and sees none, he deduces that it must be himself and comes forward the first night.  
So: 1 nominee ⇒ he appears on night 1.

Step 2  (induction hypothesis).  
Assume that whenever exactly k nominees exist, all k of them (and only them) will come forward on night k.

Step 3  (induction step).  
Now suppose there are k + 1 nominees.  
Each of these k + 1 people sees exactly k others who are nominated.

• Each of them reasons:  
  “If I myself were not nominated, there would only be those k people on the list.  
  By the induction hypothesis they would all realise this and step forward on night k.”

• When night k passes and nobody comes forward, each of the k + 1 villagers realises that the assumption “I am not nominated” is impossible.  
  Consequently each concludes, “I too must be nominated,” and therefore all k + 1 nominees come forward on night k + 1.

Thus, by mathematical induction, if exactly k villagers are nominated, all k of them (and no one else) come to the hall on the k-th night.

Step 4  (apply the result to the story).  
In Einstown nobody appeared on nights 1 through 29, but some came on night 30.  
By the argument above, that can happen only if k = 30; i.e. exactly 30 villagers were nominated, and precisely those 30 stepped forward.

Therefore the number of people who came forward on the 30th night is 30.

154,"Question: One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'

Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?
 Hint: ""Kids"" can mean something else","""Kids"" can mean something else","The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.

If the marauders were goats, every detail in the story fits naturally:

1. Goats (“kids”) rush into a grocery and “steal” food – i.e., they eat or drag off produce.  
2. When the grocer chases them they scatter, then, in typical goat fashion, wheel about and run at him; he trips, falls into a ditch and is hurt.  
3. Weeks later he can “identify the culprits” (he has seen the same animals before) and, with two fellow victims, “rounds them up.”  
4. At the “Repast of Right” he declares that justice will not be “an eye for an eye but one for two” and that the offenders will “no more … breathe.”  
   • “One for two” is the butcher’s rule that one kid (goat) will provide enough meat for about two people, so killing the goats will feed the diners.  
5. Because goats are animals, killing and eating them is not cannibalism; the poem’s final command, “let us eat,” is literal.

Hence the punishment inflicted on the three guilty “kids” is that they are slaughtered, cooked and eaten at the dinner.

Final answer: The “kids” are young goats; Old Man Justice and his friends put the three goats to death and serve their meat as the meal, thereby “eating their justice.”",True

158,"Question: Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?
 Hint: Why did they stop on their way to school?",Why did they stop on their way to school?,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the conversation take place on an unknown “today’’ = T₀.  
Number the days of the week 0,1,…,6 beginning with

0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, …, 6 = Saturday,

and write T₀ = x (mod 7).  All other days are obtained by adding or subtracting integers mod 7; e.g.  
T₀ + 2 is “the day after tomorrow”, T₀ − 3 is “three days ago”, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  “When the day after tomorrow is yesterday …”

“The day after tomorrow’’ is T₀ + 2.  
It will be “yesterday’’ on that later day T such that

T − 1  =  T₀ + 2   (mod 7)  ⇒ T = T₀ + 3.

Hence the first part of the sentence refers to the day T₁ = T₀ + 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  “… that day which was ‘today’ when the day before yesterday was tomorrow”

Look for a day S on which “the day before yesterday’’ is “tomorrow’’.

Relative to S, “the day before yesterday’’ is S − 2 and “tomorrow’’ is S + 1.  
We require

S − 2  =  S + 1   (mod 7)  ⇒ −2 ≡ 1 (mod 7),

which is impossible.  
Thus the words cannot be interpreted from the standpoint of S itself; they must be spoken from the present standpoint T₀.

From T₀’s viewpoint, “the day before yesterday’’ is T₀ − 2.
Which past day had T₀ − 2 as its “tomorrow’’?  
That day is

S = (T₀ − 2) − 1 = T₀ − 3.

So the second clause speaks of the day S = T₀ − 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Equality of the two stated distances from Sunday

Priscilla says that on T₁ (“the day after tomorrow is yesterday’’) the distance of that day from Sunday will equal the distance from Sunday of S (“the day before yesterday was tomorrow’’).

Using the minimal distance around the 7-day circle, define

d(k) = the distance from Sunday of the day T₀ + k  
   = min( (x+k) mod 7 , 7 − ((x+k) mod 7) ).

We need d(+3) = d(−3).

Compute the pair ((x+3) mod 7 , (x−3) mod 7) = (x+3, x+4) mod 7.

Listing the seven possibilities shows that the two numbers are 3 apart from Sunday simultaneously only when

x+3 ≡ 3 (mod 7) and x+4 ≡ 4 (mod 7), i.e.  x ≡ 0 (mod 7).

Thus x = 0 and T₀ is Sunday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Verification with actual day names

Take T₀ = Sunday.

•  Day after tomorrow = Tuesday.  
   Tuesday becomes “yesterday’’ on Wednesday (T₁).

•  Day before yesterday = Friday.  
   Friday was “tomorrow’’ on Thursday (S).

Distance to Sunday:
   Wednesday is 3 days after Sunday;  
   Thursday is 3 days before Sunday.  
The distances are equal, exactly as Priscilla asserted.

7. Those that prefer chocolate to caramel candy cannot be steeplechasers.
8. Steeplechasers are vegetarians.
 Hint: nan",,Only alligators that are vegetarians are allowed to watch rabbits play hockey.,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Reasoning

(i)  Statement 3 says that certain days are “set aside for alligators to watch rabbits play
      hockey.”  
      That arrangement is made for the alligators as a class; hence every creature that is
      an alligator is one of the creatures that may (i.e. can) watch a hockey game.

      In logical form:    If x is an alligator then x can watch hockey.  
      A(x)  ⇒  H(x)

(ii) Statement 5 tells us that “only steeplechasers can watch hockey games.”  
      Thus a creature that can watch hockey must be a steeplechaser.

      In logical form:    If x can watch hockey then x is a steeplechaser.  
      H(x)  ⇒  S(x)

(iii)  From (i) and (ii) we chain the implications:

          A(x) ⇒ H(x) ⇒ S(x),  

       so every alligator is a steeplechaser:

          A(x) ⇒ S(x).

(iv) Statement 8 adds that “steeplechasers are vegetarians.”

      In logical form:    If x is a steeplechaser then x is a vegetarian.  
      S(x)  ⇒  V(x)

(v)  Combining (iii) and (iv):

          A(x) ⇒ S(x) ⇒ V(x),

      therefore

          A(x) ⇒ V(x),

      i.e. every alligator is a vegetarian.

Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?
 Hint: The fraction is in sevenths",The fraction is in sevenths,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.

Manny (the boy) = M,  
Goodie (the girl) = G,

1.  If Biggie had left only a boy, the will requires  
   boy : widow = 2 : 1.  
   Hence with both children we must keep M : W = 2 : 1 ⇒ M = 2W.  

2.  If Biggie had left only a girl, the will requires  
   widow : girl = 2 : 1.  
   Hence with both children we must keep W : G = 2 : 1 ⇒ W = 2G ⇒ G = W⁄2.

3.  The three shares must exhaust the estate:  
   M + W + G = E.  
   Substituting M = 2W and G = W⁄2,

        2W + W + W⁄2 = E
        (7⁄2)W = E
        W = (2⁄7)E.

4.  Therefore

• B(X) = number of blue ribbons won by rose X,  
• R(X) = number of red ribbons won by rose X,

The six roses are  
P – “Pretty in Pink”, R – “Ravishing Red”, S – “Simply Silver”,  
T – “Mrs. Thelma Thorne”, V – “Very Violet”, Y – “Yummy Yellow”.

1.  The show awarded 28 ribbons, so  
  ∑ T(X)=28.

2.  Clue 2: T(P)=¼·28=7 and T(P)=T(R)+T(S)+T(Y).  (1)

3.  Hint and clue 5: Y won one blue and no red ribbons ⇒ T(Y)=1, B(Y)=1, R(Y)=0.

4.  Substitute T(Y)=1 in (1): T(R)+T(S)=7−1=6.  (2)

5.  Clue 4: ¾ of R’s ribbons are red ⇒ T(R) is a multiple of 4.

6.  Clue 6: S has equal blue and red ribbons ⇒ T(S) is even.

   From (2) the even numbers that sum to 6 with a multiple of 4 give the only possible pair

7.  Determine R’s colours from clue 4:  
  R(R)=¾·4=3, B(R)=1.

   For S, equal colours (clue 6):  
  B(S)=R(S)=1.

8.  Totals so far:  T(P)=7, T(R)=4, T(S)=2, T(Y)=1.  
   Ribbons used = 7+4+2+1 = 14, leaving 14 for T and V.

9.  Clue 3: T(V)=T(T)+T(S)=T(T)+2.  
   Together with T(V)+T(T)=14 we obtain  
  T(T)+2+T(T)=14  ⇒ 2T(T)=12 ⇒ T(T)=6, T(V)=8.

10. Clue 5: one-third of T’s ribbons are blue ⇒  
  B(T)=⅓·6=2, R(T)=4.

11. Clue 8: V’s red = R(T)+R(R)=4+3=7 ⇒ R(V)=7.  
    Therefore B(V)=T(V)−R(V)=8−7=1.

12. Clue 7: V’s blue equals P’s blue ⇒ B(P)=B(V)=1, hence  
  R(P)=T(P)−B(P)=7−1=6.

13. Check that all totals are different: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 – yes.

163,"Question: Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""
 Hint: The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.

* stands for T, L, M, V, or Y
# stands for S, H, C, M, or B
^ stands for F, S, K, I, or O
$ stands for O, W, G, U, or P
The four letter code word, #$^*, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: High variance?",High variance?,Boom and Bust.,GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"The symbols restrict each position of the four-letter code word as follows

$  →  O, W, G, U, P  
^  →  F, S, K, I, O  
*  →  T, L, M, V, Y  

1.  Because * can only be T, L, M, V or Y, any admissible English word must end with one of these letters.  
    Common four-letter antonym pairs ending with such letters include pairs like “…T” or “…M”.

2.  The hint “High variance?” brings to mind the economic expression “boom-bust cycle”, i.e. alternating periods of prosperity and collapse.

3.  Check the pair BOOM / BUST against the symbol restrictions.

   • BOOM:

165,"Question: There are three students Anu, Bob and Coy. They have exactly three books - one on Physics, one on Chemistry and one on Math. Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.
 Hint: Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.

P, C, M = owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books.  
A, B, C = Anu, Bob, Coy.  
Each student owns exactly one book and vice-versa.

Statements

Anu  
A1 : P = A  
A2 : M ≠ B  
A3 : C ≠ C  

Bob  
B1 : P ≠ B  
B2 : C = C  
B3 : M ≠ A  

Coy  
C1 : P ≠ A  
C2 : M ≠ C  
C3 : C ≠ B  

Exactly one of the three students is a truth-teller (all statements true), one a liar (all false), and one alternates (at least one true and one false).

–––– Case 1 :  Anu is the truth-teller ––––

A1 gives P = A.  
With P already fixed, the two remaining books (M and C) must go to B and C.

A2 requires M ≠ B, hence M = C.  
A3 requires C ≠ C, hence C = B.

Thus the unique ownership is

 Physics → Anu  
 Chemistry → Bob  
 Maths → Coy.

Test Bob’s and Coy’s statements with this ownership.

Bob: B1 T, B2 F, B3 T → alternator (mix of T and F)  
Coy: C1 F, C2 F, C3 F → liar (all false)

This exactly matches the required pattern (one T, one L, one alternating).  
So the arrangement is self-consistent.

–––– Case 2 :  Anu is the liar ––––

All three of Anu’s statements must be false:

 P ≠ A, M = B, C = C.

That assigns two books (M to B, C to C); the only book left, Physics, must go to A, contradicting P ≠ A.  Impossible.

–––– Case 3 :  Anu alternates ––––

Then Bob and Coy must be the pure truth-teller and pure liar in some order.

• If Bob is the truth-teller, B2 (“C = C”) is true, so C = C.  
  Coy, to be the liar, would have to make C3 false, but with C = C, C3 (“C ≠ B”) is true, contradiction.

• If Bob is the liar, all his statements are false, giving  
 P = B, C ≠ C, M = A.  
  That leaves no book for Coy, again impossible.

Hence no consistent solution exists with Anu alternating.

–––– Conclusion ––––

The only possible situation is the one found in Case 1:

 • Anu always tells the truth.  
 • Coy always lies.  
 • Bob owns the Chemistry book.

Therefore each of the three given conclusions is logically forced.

166,"Question: Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.

Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.

Because of Rule 7 he must finish the remaining three eastward jumps before he is permitted to change direction.  
Choosing the minimum legal length (6 in) for each of those compulsory eastward jumps keeps him as near to the mushroom as possible and minimises the distance of the return jump.

The quickest workable programme is therefore:

1. 2nd jump of the eastward set – 6 in E  
2. 3rd jump of the eastward set – 6 in E  
3. 4th jump of the eastward set – 6 in E  
   (At this point Grobi is 18 in east of the spot where he first saw the mushroom and therefore 24 in east of the mushroom itself.)
4. Having now completed four consecutive eastward jumps, Grobi may change direction.  
   He jumps 24 in WEST and lands with his centre exactly on the mushroom, whose centre is 6 in west of his original position.  
   Landing directly atop the mushroom, he eats it.

2. (C ∨ V) ⇒ ¬A
3. (¬A ∧ ¬W) ⇒ Ch
4. (¬L ∧ ¬A) ⇒ V
5. W ⇒ (C ∨ Ch)
6. ¬V ⇒ (¬A ∧ ¬Ch)

Step 1.  Show that Vincent must have gone.

Assume, for contradiction, V is false.

Then by (6) we must also have A = Ch = false.

Hence the two riders must be chosen from {W, L, C}.

• If {W , L} ride, W is present, so by (5) either C or Ch must also ride – impossible (there would be three).

• If {W , C} ride, antecedent of (4) is satisfied (both L and A are absent), so V must ride – contradiction.

• If {L , C} ride, antecedent of (3) is satisfied (A and W are absent) so Ch must ride – again three riders.

Every possibility with V absent is impossible, so our assumption is wrong and

V is one of the two knights.

Step 2.  Determine who accompanies Vincent.

Because V is true, (2) forces A to be false.

Case 2a.  Suppose W rides with V.  
But W ⇒ (C ∨ Ch) by (5).  Either choice would give a third rider, impossible.  
Therefore W does not go.

Case 2b.  Suppose C rides with V.  
With A = W = false, antecedent of (3) holds, so Ch must also ride – three riders again.  
Hence C does not go.

The only knight left who can accompany Vincent is Charles.

Put Ch true and check all statements:

1. ¬W ∧ ¬V is false (V is true) – statement satisfied.  
2. V true ⇒ ¬A (A is false) – satisfied.  
3. ¬A ∧ ¬W is true, conclusion Ch is true – satisfied.  
4. ¬L ∧ ¬A is true, conclusion V is true – satisfied.  
5. W is false, so statement vacuously true.  
6. V is true, antecedent false – satisfied.

All six statements are simultaneously true with exactly the two riders Vincent and Charles.

(2) Day 2 :  “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.”  
(3) Day 3 :  “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.”

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  The second statement fixes Day 2.

If Day 2 really were Sunday, Saturday or Thursday, then statement (2) would be true and Day 2 would have to be the truth-day T.  
But if T were Sunday, Saturday or Thursday, Steve would lie on the remaining six days, so on Day 1 and Day 3 he would be lying.  
Yet with T equal to one of those three days it is easy to check that both (1) and (3) come out true, contradicting that Steve is lying on Day 1 and Day 3.  
Hence Day 2 cannot be Sunday, Saturday or Thursday, and statement (2) is false.  
So Day 2 is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday, and Day 2 ≠ T.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  The first and third statements cannot both have the same truth-value (hint).

If both (1) and (3) were true, then Steve would lie on the four days  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, leaving three other days for exactly one truth-day – impossible.  

If both were false, then each of them fails, so  
 • he must tell the truth on at least one of Monday or Tuesday, and  
 • he must tell the truth on at least one of Wednesday or Friday,  
giving at least two truth-days – impossible.  

Therefore one of (1) and (3) is true and the other is false.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Try the two possibilities.

Case A.  (1) true, (3) false.  

If (1) is true, Steve lies on Monday and Tuesday.  
Since Day 2 is not a truth-day (Step 1) and Day 2 is one of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday, Day 2 cannot be Wednesday (because (3) would then have to be true).  
So Day 2 is Monday, Tuesday or Friday, but Day 2 cannot be Monday or Tuesday (he lies on those), forcing Day 2 = Friday.  
Then Day 1 = Thursday and Day 3 = Saturday.  
But on Saturday (3) would be spoken and would be true (he lies on Wednesday and Friday), contradicting that (3) is false.  
So Case A is impossible.

Case B.  (1) false, (3) true.  

Since (3) is true, Steve really does lie on Wednesday and Friday.  
Therefore Day 3 must be the truth-day T (because (3) is true) and Day 3 is Tuesday (Step 1 forced Day 2 to be Monday, so Day 3 is Tuesday).  
With T = Tuesday we can check the other two statements:

• Day 1 = Sunday.  
  Sunday is a lie-day, so (1) must be false.  
  Indeed, with T = Tuesday he lies on Monday but not on Tuesday, so  
  “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays’’ is false. ✓  

• Day 2 = Monday is a lie-day; statement (2) is “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.’’  
  Since it is Monday, the statement is false, as required. ✓

Everything is consistent in Case B, so Case B is the only possibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion.  

The unique day on which Steve tells the truth is Tuesday.

170,"Question: The last contestant has just completed the cycling leg of the triathlon.  The 15 clues that follow are with respect to this point in the race.  From the clues you must determine:  the color of shorts each runner is wearing, the positions at the end of the cycling leg, and the final standings.
Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.
4) The runner in the orange shorts took over the lead.
5) Ethan and the runner in the green shorts switched places.
6) David moved ahead of Brian, who was not wearing the blue shorts.
7) Chuck stubbed his toe, lost one position, and was now just ahead of Alvin.
8) Ethan and Brian, neither one who wore the violet shorts, switched places.
9) Alvin moved ahead of the runners who wore the green and orange shorts.
10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.
12) Chuck moved ahead of the runner who wore the orange shorts.
13) With a burst of speed, David moved ahead of Ethan, Frank, and the runner in the yellow shorts.
14) Ethan moved ahead of the runner who wore the red shorts.
15) Out of breath, the runner wearing the green shorts fell behind Brian, who now trailed the runner wearing the yellow shorts.  No further position changes occur.  The race ends.

From the clues, mark off combinations that can not exist.  ","Set up a grid of names versus colors.  From the clues, mark off combinations that can not exist.  From this, it can be found that Brian wears orange.  This leaves Ethan wearing blue.  From Clue 7 and Clue 9, Chuck can only be orange or green.  From Clue 12, Chuck can not be orange, therefore he must be green.  This leaves David wearing red, Frank wearing violet, and Alvin wearing yellow.  This establishes:  Alvin = yellow, Brian = orange, Chuck = green, David = red, Ethan = blue, Frank = violet
To determine the final results, work backward, substituting names for colors.  From Clue 15, Alvin beats Brian beats Chuck.  From Clue 14, Ethan beats David.  From Clue 13, David beats Frank beats Alvin.  This establishes the final results as:  Ethan, David, Frank, Alvin, Brian, Chuck.
Now work backward to determine the cycling standings, substituting names for colors.  You need to determine what the standings would have had to have been prior to each clue.

171,"Question: Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?
 Hint: Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.",Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let the six wedges (in pounds) be  
15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 31.

Exactly one of them is the Chillirella; the other five are Kebabrie.

1.  Assign variables  
   – c = weight of the single Chillirella wedge.  
   – N  = total weight bought by Norma (two Kebabrie wedges).  
   – 2N = total weight bought by Laura (three Kebabrie wedges).

2.  Total‐weight equation  
   The five Kebabrie wedges weigh (119 − c) pounds, because the sum of all six
   weights is  
   15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 31 = 119.
   But these same five wedges are exactly Norma’s two plus Laura’s three, so  
   (Norma) + (Laura) = N + 2N = 3N = 119 − c.

   Hence 119 − c is divisible by 3, i.e. c ≡ 2 (mod 3).

3.  Which listed weight satisfies c ≡ 2 (mod 3) ?  
   15≡0, 16≡1, 18≡0, 19≡1, 20≡2, 31≡1 (mod 3).  
   The only candidate is c = 20.

4.  Determine Norma’s and Laura’s purchases  
   With c = 20, we have 3N = 119 − 20 = 99, so N = 33.  
   Norma needs two distinct weights that sum to 33.  
   The remaining five weights after removing 20 are 15, 16, 18, 19, 31, and
   15 + 18 = 33 works uniquely.

   Therefore  
   – Norma bought 15 lb and 18 lb (total 33 lb).  
   – Laura bought the other three Kebabrie wedges 16 lb, 19 lb, 31 lb  
     (total 66 lb = 2·33 lb).

All conditions are satisfied, so the unpurchased wedge—the Chillirella—must
weigh 20 pounds.

Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"Let T be the actual number of truthtellers among the 12 men.

Statement made by man i (i = 1,2,…,12):
“At most i − 1 of us are truthtellers.”
In symbols: T ≤ i − 1.

For a fixed T:

• The statement of man i is true exactly when T ≤ i − 1, i.e. when i ≥ T + 1.  
• Therefore the number of true statements is the count of indices i satisfying i ≥ T + 1, which is 12 − T.

But “number of true statements” must equal T itself, because each true statement is uttered by a truthteller and each truthteller makes exactly one statement.

Hence we need
T = 12 − T  → 2T = 12  → T = 6.

So there are exactly 6 truthtellers.

Which men are they?  
For T = 6, the inequality T ≤ i − 1 becomes 6 ≤ i − 1, i.e. i ≥ 7.  
Thus men 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 tell the truth, and men 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 lie.

Verification:
• Men 1–6 claim “At most 0,1,2,3,4,5 of us are truthtellers” respectively; each is false since T = 6.  
• Men 7–12 claim “At most 6,7,8,9,10,11 of us are truthtellers” respectively; each is true since T = 6.

From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation.

• P is chosen ⇔ R is chosen  
• if T is chosen then V must also be chosen

CASE 1 – Leader R  
If R is already leader, the two bomb-experts have to be the only other qualified men P and Q (R cannot fill two posts).  
Because P is present, the first constraint is automatically satisfied.  
Any two of the three soldiers U, V, W may be taken, giving C(3,2)=3 possibilities.

CASE 2 – Leader S  
Now the two bomb-experts must be chosen from P, Q, R.  
Because P and R must appear together or not at all, the only permissible pair is {P,R}; the pair {P,Q} lacks R, and {Q,R} lacks P.  
Again any two of the soldiers U, V, W may be selected, giving another 3 possibilities.

CASE 3 – Leader T  
If T is leader, the second constraint forces V to be one of the two soldiers.  
Hence the soldier pair must be {V,U} or {V,W} – 2 possibilities.  
For the bomb-experts we must again honor the P–R coupling, so the only admissible pair is {P,R}. (Pairs {P,Q} or {Q,R} violate the coupling.)

Starting inside the cell he must therefore begin with an exit; the six–step walk has
the fixed pattern  

(exit , entrance , exit , entrance , exit , entrance).

We now look for a six-door sequence that  
(i) alternates exit/entrance as above,  
(ii) uses every door once, and  
(iii) respects the rule printed on the wall

 A → B or E, B → C or E, C → D or F, D → A or F, E → B or D, F → C or D.

────────────────  Search for a legal alternating walk  ────────────────
1  Try to begin with the one exit we already know, B.  
   B (exit) could be followed only by C or E (must be entrances).  
   But B is an exit, so the next door would have to be C or E ≡ entrance.  
   Every continuation runs into a dead end after at most five steps, so
   no walk can start with B.

2  Begin with another possible exit.  
   Choose C as the first exit (so for now C = exit).  
   Rule: C must be followed by D or F, and the second door must be an entrance.
   Because F is already known to be an entrance, take

  C (exit) → F (entrance).

3  Third door (exit) has to follow F.  
   From the rule F → C or D, and C is already used, so the only choice is

  F (entrance) → D (exit).   (Therefore D is an exit.)

4  Fourth door (entrance) must follow D.  
   Rule D → A or F, but F is used, so

  D (exit) → A (entrance).   (A is indeed an entrance.)

5  Fifth door (exit) must follow A.  
   Rule A → B or E, and only B is an exit, so

  A (entrance) → B (exit).

6  Sixth and last door (entrance) must follow B.  
   Rule B → C or E, but C is used, hence

  B (exit) → E (entrance).

We have reached six different doors, the required alternation (X E X E X E), and every step obeys the printed rule.  The categories are now fixed:

Exits : C , D , B  Entrances : F , A , E

─────────────────────────  Result  ─────────────────────────
The only possible order in which the prisoner can pass through all six
doors is

C  →  F  →  D  →  A  →  B  →  E.

Final answer: C, F, D, A, B, E",True
