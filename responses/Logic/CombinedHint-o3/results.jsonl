{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm\" said the wrestler.\nThe swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

Since each such REGULAR is guaranteed another\n  visit, he will eventually encounter A in the OFF position, flip it to ON and make his\n  sole contribution.  \n\u2022 Thus every REGULAR is eventually counted, so C eventually attains the value 22.\n\nCorrectness of the declaration  \n\u2022 When C = 22, every one of the 22 REGULARS has contributed once, hence has visited\n  at least once, and of course the COUNTER himself has visited.  Therefore all 23\n  prisoners have visited, and the statement the COUNTER gives the warden is true.\n\nCompliance with the warden\u2019s rule \u201cexactly one switch must be flipped\u201d  \n\u2022 In every possible circumstance each prisoner flips one and only one switch, because\n  the algorithm always prescribes exactly one flip (either A or B).\n\nThus the prisoners have a fully justified strategy that guarantees eventual freedom\nand never risks the alligators.\n\nFinal answer:  The prisoners follow the strategy above; the COUNTER declares freedom the first time his count reaches 22, and this declaration is guaranteed to be correct.", "Status": true}

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Hint: It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.

Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).

Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7).

And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Hint: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.

Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.

(The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3.

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Hint: Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise.

This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:\nRoom 1\nCEO\nIT Analyst\nABM delegate\nGrimaldi\nCarl\nReed Right delegate\nRoom 2\nEdgar\nDeveloper\nThomas\nClarkson\nSince the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.\nNow this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:\nThe CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth.

The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won.

The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round.

They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely.

If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4.

Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4.

The boat enters lock 1 at the bottom level.  \n2. To raise it one stage, lock 1 is filled with water taken from the pound immediately above it (the pound between locks 1 and 2). That pound loses exactly one lock-full, \u0394V = 7 000 L.  \n3. The boat sails out of the full lock into that upper pound. The water that has just lifted the boat is still there \u2013 it is now in lock 1.  \n4. Before the next boat can use the lock, lock 1 will be emptied \u2013 its contents are discharged into the lower canal. Thus the lock-full that was removed from the pound above lock 1 is now in the lower canal.\n\nExactly the same thing happens at every other lock: to work lock k one lock-full is taken from the pound above it and, after the boat has gone, that same lock-full is dumped into the pound below it.\n\nHence for ONE complete ascent the chain of locks transfers one lock-full of water from each pound to the pound below it. Starting with the summit pound and repeating the process 13 times, the only pound that finally loses water from the whole system is the summit pound. All the intermediate pounds finish exactly where they started.\n\nConclusion 1  \nOne passage of a boat through the whole flight removes only one lock-full of water (7 000 L) from the summit pound, not 13\u00d77 000 L.\n\nExactly the same argument applies to a descent, so every transit of the flight \u2013 up or down \u2013 costs 7 000 L of water at the summit.\n\nWhat the hired road tanker can do  \nA 22-tonne tanker carries\n\n22 t \u00d7 1 000 kg t\u207b\u00b9 \u00d7 1 L kg\u207b\u00b9 = 22 000 L of water.\n\nNumber of boat passages that one load can replace:\n\n22 000 L \u00f7 7 000 L \u2248 3.1\n\nSo a single trip brings enough water for three complete boat transits. Even on a moderately busy day the driver can make several round trips; the quantity he delivers easily keeps pace with traffic.\n\nConclusion 2 (answer to the question)  \nYes, the contract is reasonable. Only the summit pound needs replenishing, and each boat takes just one lock-full (7 000 L) from it. A 22-tonne tanker therefore replaces the water used by roughly three boats per load, which is ample for normal traffic levels.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 57, "Question": "Question: There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.\"  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.

The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.

The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?\n Hint: Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison.

Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:\n[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.\n[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.\n[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.\n[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.\n[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.\nThe Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.

We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:\nPrime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]\nSquare - 0,4,9 [2 games each]\nNeither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]\nSince all of the \"neither prime nor square\" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 \"prime or square\" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.\n[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.\nWe now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?\n Hint:  1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten.

(As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower.

Crackle replies \u201cI already knew that all three of our numbers were different.\u201d\n\n    Crackle had reached this conclusion before Snap spoke, so it had to follow from c\n    alone.\n\n        \u2022 For him to know c \u2260 s and c \u2260 p, the equation 14 \u2212 2c > 0 must be false,\n          otherwise s or p could equal c.  \n          Hence 2c \u2265 14 \u21d2 c \u2265 7.\n\n        \u2022 For him to know s \u2260 p, the value 14 \u2212 c must be odd; otherwise s = p = (14 \u2212 c)/2\n          would be possible.  \n          Since 14 is even, 14 \u2212 c is odd exactly when c is odd.\n\n    So c must be an odd integer \u2265 7.  \n    The possibilities are c = 7, 9, 11.\n\n3.  Because s is odd (step 1) and c is odd, their sum s + c is even; hence p = 14 \u2212 ( s + c )\n    is even.

In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.

The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.\nYou can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "We argue by (strong) mathematical induction on the number n of lions that share the island with a single sheep.\n\nStatement P(n) : \u201cIf there are n lions and one sheep, the sheep is eaten if and only if n is odd; the sheep survives if and only if n is even.\u201d\n\nBase case (n = 1).\nWith only one lion, that lion can eat the sheep and afterwards becomes a sheep himself.  \nBecause there are then zero lions left, no one can eat him.  \nSince he strictly prefers eating a sheep to eating grass and incurs no risk, he definitely eats.  \nThus the sheep is eaten when n = 1 (odd).  \nP(1) is true.\n\nInduction step.  \nAssume P(k) is true for every k < n (strong induction hypothesis).  \nWe show P(n) is true.\n\nTake an arbitrary lion L in a situation with n lions.  \nL contemplates pouncing on the sheep.  \n\u2022 If L pounces, he will instantly turn into a sheep.  \n\u2022 Immediately thereafter the island will contain n \u2013 1 lions and one sheep (namely L).  \nL now asks: \u201cIn a world with n \u2013 1 lions and one sheep, will that sheep be eaten?\u201d\n\nBy the induction hypothesis P(n \u2013 1):\n\u2022 If n \u2013 1 is odd (i.e., n is even), then a lone sheep facing an odd number of lions is eaten.  \n  Hence L would be eaten, a fate he strictly prefers to avoid.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...\n Hint: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:\nNorris McDim:\nA) I did not leave the door open.\nB) Morris was the one who did it.\nNobby Shifty:\nA) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.\nB) Norris was on duty.\nMorris the Daft:\nA) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.\nB) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.\nRobby O'Mental:\nA) I did not leave the door open.\nB) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.\nConsidering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?\n Hint: For each person, assume they did it.

Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

{"ID": 247, "Question": "Question: You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:\n1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.\n2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.\n3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.\n4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.\nAs you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.\nWhat sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?\n Hint: You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.", "Hint": "You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.", "Human Solution": "5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9\nFrom  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.\nFrom clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.\nFrom clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.\nThat leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last.
