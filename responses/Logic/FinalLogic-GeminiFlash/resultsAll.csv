0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Identify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.  Name the order that the daughters were born in and the day of the week that they leave to go home.  What is the seating arrangement at the dinner table?
Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.

Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

9,"""What's the password?"" asked The Entity, with a weasel-like demeanor. Spy IQ was confused, until he realized he had received a strange postcard weeks before. The crafty spy still needed to enter the underground cellar leading to a new set of gadgets to be used on the next mission, but he was halted by The Entity's presence. What the postcard said might help Spy IQ find the password The Entity needs to allow the spy into the secret lair. The postcard says this:

It was my niece.
Wouldn't you agree?
It was because she joined a band of bikers.
She's doing lots of things wrong.
She always shows a lot of toughness.

That P.S. looks like it could be the catalyst to solve for the encrypted password. But, what could it be?","Look closely at the P.S.
A secret message lies within the P.S. that will assist you in searching for the password.
Here, I'll change it up a bit:
P.S.
Isaac Newton:

If you look carefully at the P.S., you will notice that the first letter of each word spells IN NOBLE GASES:

After saying the password, Spy IQ entered the secret lair and found useful gadgets, including Instant Tile Camouflage.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break down this puzzle step by step.

1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Spy IQ needs a password to enter the cellar. The Entity knows the password. The password is hidden in a strange postcard.

2.  **Analyze the Postcard Content:** The postcard has two parts:
    *   A main body of text about an expelled niece who joined bikers, is doing wrong things, and shows toughness.
    *   A P.S. attributed to Isaac Newton, containing two seemingly unrelated sentences: ""Near orange bags lying east."" and ""Gets as strange equally slowly.""

3.  **Focus on the Hint:** The prompt specifically states, ""That P.S. looks like it could be the catalyst to solve for the encrypted password."" This strongly suggests the main body text is flavor or misdirection, and the key lies within the P.S.

4.  **Examine the P.S. Closely:**
    *   ""P.S."" - A standard postscript marker.
    *   ""Isaac Newton:"" - The attribution. Newton is famous for physics, gravity, laws of motion, calculus, optics. Does this name directly point to the solution? Perhaps it hints at a scientific theme.
    *   Sentence 1: ""Near orange bags lying east.""
    *   Sentence 2: ""Gets as strange equally slowly.""

5.  **Look for Patterns or Codes in the Sentences:** Cryptic clues often involve extracting information from the text itself. Common methods include:
    *   Taking specific letters (first letters, last letters, letters at certain positions).
    *   Counting things (words, letters).
    *   Anagrams.
    *   Substitution ciphers (less likely without a key).

6.  **Try the Most Common Method for Such Sentences: Acrostics:** Let's try taking the first letter of each word in each sentence.
    *   Sentence 1: **N**ear **o**range **b**ags **l**ying **e**ast.
        The first letters are N, O, B, L, E. This spells **NOBLE**.
    *   Sentence 2: **G**ets **a**s **s**trange **e**qually **s**lowly.
        The first letters are G, A, S, E, S. This spells **GASES**.

7.  **Combine the Results:** Putting the two words together, we get **NOBLE GASES**.

8.  **Evaluate ""NOBLE GASES"" as a Potential Password:**
    *   Is it a recognizable term? Yes, Noble Gases are a group of chemical elements (Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon, Oganesson).
    *   Does it fit the context of a password derived from a cryptic clue? Yes, extracting terms this way is a classic puzzle mechanism.
    *   Does the attribution to Isaac Newton make sense? While Noble Gases weren't discovered *as a group* and understood in Newton's time (they were mainly identified in the late 19th century), the P.S. *attributes* the message to him. This suggests the *message itself* contains the clue, and the Newton attribution might simply add a scientific theme or be a slight misdirection. The core discovery comes directly from the sentences provided.

9.  **Conclusion:** The most direct and logical interpretation of the P.S., following common cryptic puzzle patterns, is to take the first letters of each word in the two sentences. This yields ""NOBLE GASES"". This is a plausible password phrase derived directly from the text.

Final answer: NOBLE GASES",True

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.

5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.
A) H can not be 8.  C can not be 1.  C can not be 0.  B can not be 9.  D can not be 1.  D can not be 2.  F can not be 1.

16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
21,"Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""

""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""

Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:30        Elena        0:50 later, 1:30 after Derec, 1:20 after Adele
7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.

2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F

Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)

If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid

One of them is false.  C's and D's  contradict each other.  One of them is false.  Therefore, there are four additional false statements.
Assume A is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's second statement, and D's first statement are the additional false statements.
Assume D is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's first statement, and D's third statement are false.  This also only makes five false statements.  D did not do it.
Assume C did it.  If so, A's second statement, D's first and third statements are false.  This again, makes only five false statements.
After ruling out suspects A, C and D, B is the culprit.  B's third statement, C's second statement, and D's first and third statements are the additional false statements.  This adds up to six.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the four suspects be A, B, C, and D. Let G_X denote the proposition that suspect X is guilty. We are given that exactly one of G_A, G_B, G_C, G_D is true.
Let K be the proposition ""The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car."" The problem states that the thief ""unknowingly took the automobile"", which means K is a true statement about the thief. Since there is only one thief, K is a universally true proposition in this scenario. So, T(K) = True.

Let's write down the statements and their truth values:
Suspect A:
A1: C and I have met many times before today. Let this be M_CA. T(A1) = M_CA.
A2: B is guilty. T(A2) = G_B.
A3: The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car. T(A3) = K.

Suspect B:
B1: D did not do it. T(B1) = ~G_D.
B2: D's third statement is false. T(B2) = ~T(D3).
B3: I am innocent. T(B3) = ~G_B.

Suspect C:
C1: I have never met A before today. T(C1) = ~M_CA.
C2: B is not guilty. T(C2) = ~G_B.
C3: D knows how to drive. Let this be H_D. T(C3) = H_D.

Suspect D:
D1: B's first statement is false. T(D1) = ~T(B1).
D2: I do not know how to drive. T(D2) = ~H_D.
D3: A did it. T(D3) = G_A.

We are given that T(K) = True. Therefore, A3 is a True statement. T(A3) = T.

Let's analyze the logical relationships between the statements:
1. T(A2) = G_B, T(B3) = ~G_B, T(C2) = ~G_B. Note that B3 and C2 are the same statement.
2. T(B1) = ~G_D, T(D1) = ~T(B1) = ~ (~G_D) = G_D. B1 and D1 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.
3. T(D3) = G_A, T(B2) = ~T(D3) = ~G_A. B2 and D3 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.
4. T(C3) = H_D, T(D2) = ~H_D. C3 and D2 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.
5. T(A1) = M_CA, T(C1) = ~M_CA. A1 and C1 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.

We have 12 statements in total. Six are True and six are False.
Statements involved in pairs of contradictions are: B1, D1, B2, D3, C3, D2, A1, C1. These 8 statements form 4 pairs, each contributing one True and one False statement. So, these 8 statements account for 4 True and 4 False statements in total.

The remaining 4 statements are A2, A3, B3, C2. These must account for the remaining 2 True and 2 False statements.
A2: G_B
A3: K (We know T(A3) = T)
B3: ~G_B
C2: ~G_B
Note B3 and C2 are the same statement. Let's call the truth value V_B3C2.
The statements are {A2, A3, B3/C2}. Their truth values are {T(A2), T(A3), V_B3C2}.
T(A2) = G_B
T(A3) = T
V_B3C2 = ~G_B

We need this set of statements to contain 2 True and 2 False values among A2, A3, B3, C2.
Since B3 and C2 are the same statement, they have the same truth value (V_B3C2).
If G_B is True: T(A2)=T, V_B3C2=F. The truth values are {T, T, F, F} for {A2, A3, B3, C2}. This is 2 True and 2 False, which is consistent.
If G_B is False: T(A2)=F, V_B3C2=T. The truth values are {F, T, T, T} for {A2, A3, B3, C2}. This is 3 True and 1 False, which is NOT consistent with needing 2 True and 2 False from this group.

Therefore, it must be that G_B is True.
This means B is the car thief.

Let's verify this solution by checking if the truth count works out with G_B = True and K = True.
If G_B is True, then G_A, G_C, G_D must be False (since only one person is guilty).
K is True.

Truth values determined by guilt and K:
A2 (G_B): T
A3 (K): T
B3 (~G_B): F
C2 (~G_B): F
B1 (~G_D): ~F = T
D1 (G_D): F (Consistent with B1)
B2 (~G_A): ~F = T
D3 (G_A): F (Consistent with B2)

Definite truth values so far:
A2 (T), A3 (T), B1 (T), B2 (T), B3 (F), C2 (F), D1 (F), D3 (F).
This gives 4 True and 4 False statements.

The remaining statements are A1 (M_CA), C1 (~M_CA), C3 (H_D), D2 (~H_D).
As noted before, A1 and C1 are contradictory, so one is True and one is False.
C3 and D2 are contradictory, so one is True and one is False.
These 4 statements contribute 2 True and 2 False statements.

Total True statements = (T(A2)+T(A3)+T(B1)+T(B2)) + (one of A1/C1) + (one of C3/D2) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.
Total False statements = (T(B3)+T(C2)+T(D1)+T(D3)) + (one of A1/C1) + (one of C3/D2) = 4",True

32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.

12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.

Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?","On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.

**Lap 1 Reasoning:**

*   ""Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots.""
    *   These four are in places 1, 2, 3, 4.
*   ""In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst.""
    *   The ranks of these four are: Stephen (1), Ben (12), Paul (12), Jessica (11).
    *   The bottom two ranked people are Ben (12) and Paul (12). They are in the top two spots (1st and 2nd).
    *   The top ranked person is Stephen (1). He is in the worst spot among the four (4th).
    *   This places Jessica (Rank 11) in 3rd.
    *   So, 1st: Ben or Paul, 2nd: Paul or Ben, 3rd: Jessica, 4th: Stephen.
*   ""The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th.""
    *   The Major is Felicia (Rank 5). Brianna (Rank 12) passed her.
    *   This places Brianna in 5th and Felicia in 6th.
*   ""Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order.""
    *   Luke (Rank 12) is in 9th place.
    *   Clark (Rank 6) and Brad (Rank 10) passed Luke in that order. This means Clark is 7th and Brad is 8th.
*   ""The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.""
    *   The back three girls are Anna (Rank 3), Abby (Rank 10), and Kelsey (Rank 12).
    *   Highest rank (Anna) is 10th place.
    *   Middle rank (Abby) is 11th place.
    *   Lowest rank (Kelsey) is 12th place.
    *   So, Anna is 10th, Abby is 11th, and Kelsey is 12th.

Let's reconstruct the order at the end of Lap 1 based on these clues:
1.  Ben or Paul
2.  Paul or Ben
3.  Jessica
4.  Stephen
5.  Brianna
6.  Felicia
7.  Clark
8.  Brad
9.  Luke
10. Anna
11. Abby
12. Kelsey

**Lap 2 Reasoning:**

We start from the Lap 1 end order.
*   ""Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front.""
    *   Paul was either 1st or 2nd. Falling to 3rd means he was 2nd, and the person ""right by"" him (who was 1st) is now ""way in front"" (stayed 1st).
    *   So, at the end of Lap 1, the order was: 1st Ben, 2nd Paul, 3rd Jessica...
    *   After Paul slips from 2nd to 3rd: Ben remains 1st. Jessica moves up to 2nd. Everyone previously 3rd or worse shifts down one spot.
    *   Order after Paul slips: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Brianna, 6. Felicia, 7. Clark, 8. Brad, 9. Luke, 10. Anna, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each.""
    *   Clark is currently in 7th place. He moves up 2 spots to 5th place.
    *   The people previously in 5th (Brianna) and 6th (Felicia) are pushed back one place each, to 6th and 7th respectively.
    *   Order after Clark moves: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Clark, 6. Brianna, 7. Felicia, 8. Brad, 9. Luke, 10. Anna, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""Then, Felicia and Anna switched places...""
    *   Felicia is currently in 7th place. Anna is currently in 10th place. They swap.
    *   Order after Felicia/Anna swap: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Clark, 6. Brianna, 7. Anna, 8. Brad, 9. Luke, 10. Felicia, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""...and Luke and Brad switched places.""
    *   Luke is currently in 9th place. Brad is currently in 8th place. They swap.
    *   Order after Luke/Brad swap: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Clark, 6. Brianna, 7. Anna, 8. Luke, 9. Brad, 10. Felicia, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.""
    *   Abby is currently in 11th place. Kelsey is currently in 12th place. They swap.

Lap 2 Final Order:

**Calculate New Ranks:**

We use the final place and the initial rank to calculate the new rank.
Rank list: 1. Lieutenant General, 2. Brigadier General, 3. Colonel, 4. Lieutenant Colonel, 5. Major, 6. Captain, 7. First Lieutenant, 8. Second Lieutenant, 9. First Sergeant, 10. Sergeant, 11. Corporal, 12. Private.
Scoring: 1st (+5), 2nd (+4), 3rd (+3), 4th/5th (+1), 6th/7th (0), 8th/9th (-1), 10th/11th (-2), 12th (-3).
If the new rank goes above 1 or below 12, the person stays at rank 1 or 12.

1.  **Ben:** 1st place (+5 ranks). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 - 5 = 7. Rank 7 is First Lieutenant.
2.  **Paul:** 2nd place (+4 ranks). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 - 4 = 8. Rank 8 is Second Lieutenant.
3.  **Jessica:** 3rd place (+3 ranks). Initial Rank 11 (Corporal). New Rank = 11 - 3 = 8. Rank 8 is Second Lieutenant.
4.  **Stephen:** 4th place (+1 rank). Initial Rank 1 (Lieutenant General). New Rank = 1 - 1 = 0. Cannot go above Rank 1. Stays at Rank 1. Rank 1 is Lieutenant General.
5.  **Brianna:** 5th place (+1 rank). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 - 1 = 11. Rank 11 is Corporal.
6.  **Clark:** 6th place (0 rank change). Initial Rank 6 (Captain). New Rank = 6 + 0 = 6. Rank 6 is Captain.
7.  **Luke:** 7th place (0 rank change). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 + 0 = 12. Rank 12 is Private.
8.  **Anna:** 8th place (-1 rank). Initial Rank 3 (Colonel). New Rank = 3 + 1 = 4. Rank 4 is Lieutenant Colonel.
9.  **Kelsey:** 9th place (-1 rank). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 + 1 = 13. Cannot go below Rank 12. Stays at Rank 12. Rank 12 is Private.
10. **Felicia:** 10th place (-2 ranks). Initial Rank 5 (Major). New Rank = 5 + 2 = 7. Rank 7 is First Lieutenant.
11. **Brad:** 11th place (-2 ranks). Initial Rank 10 (Sergeant). New Rank = 10 + 2 = 12. Rank 12 is Private.
12. **Abby:** 12th place (-3 ranks). Initial Rank 10 (Sergeant). New Rank = 10 + 3 = 13. Cannot go below Rank 12. Stays at Rank 12. Rank 12 is Private.

Final List of Places and New Ranks:

*   1st Place: Ben, new rank First Lieutenant
*   2nd Place: Paul, new rank Second Lieutenant

2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML.

46,A man named Stewart is traveling all over the world. First he travels to Cape Town in South Africa. Then to Jakarta in Indonesia. Then to Canberra in Australia. Then to Rome in Italy. Then to Panama City in Panama. Where does he travel next?,Each time he travels to a continent he has not traveled to.,Santiago in Chile. He travels to each continent in alphabetical order then to the capital of the country that has the most southern latitude.,GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is my reasoning process to solve this problem:

1.  **Analyze the Input:** I am given a sequence of destinations: Cape Town, Jakarta, Canberra, Rome, and Panama City. I need to find the next destination in this sequence based on a pattern.

2.  **List the Destinations:**
    *   Cape Town
    *   Jakarta
    *   Canberra
    *   Rome
    *   Panama City

3.  **Look for Patterns:** I will examine different properties of the destination names and locations:
    *   **Geographic location:** Are they ordered by continent, latitude, longitude, or proximity?
        *   Cape Town (Africa)
        *   Jakarta (Asia)
        *   Canberra (Australia)
        *   Rome (Europe)
        *   Panama City (North/Central America)
        The sequence visits different continents without an obvious geographical order.
    *   **Capital cities:** Are they all capital cities?
        *   Cape Town is one of South Africa's capitals.
        *   Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia.
        *   Canberra is the capital of Australia.
        *   Rome is the capital of Italy.
        *   Panama City is the capital of Panama.
        Yes, they are all capital cities (or a capital city in South Africa's case). This is a shared property but doesn't define the sequence order.
    *   **Letters in the names:** I will examine the starting and ending letters of the names.
        *   Cape Tow**n** (Starts with C, Ends with N)
        *   **J**akart**a** (Starts with J, Ends with A)
        *   **C**anberr**a** (Starts with C, Ends with A)
        *   **R**om**e** (Starts with R, Ends with E)
        *   **P**anama Cit**y** (Starts with P, Ends with Y)
        The sequence of starting letters is C, J, C, R, P. There is no obvious alphabetical or other simple pattern here.
        The sequence of ending letters is N, A, A, E, Y. There is no obvious pattern here either.

4.  **Consider Relationships Between Consecutive Destinations:** A common type of word sequence puzzle relates the end of one item to the start of the next. Let's test the hypothesis that the *ending letter* of a destination is the *starting letter* of the *next* destination.
    *   Cape Tow**n**. Does the next city, Jakarta, start with N? No (it starts with J).
    *   Jakart**a**. Does the next city, Canberra, start with A? No (it starts with C).
    *   Canberr**a**. Does the next city, Rome, start with A? No (it starts with R).
    *   Rom**e**. Does the next city, Panama City, start with E? No (it starts with P).

5.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** The simple rule ""ending letter of city N is the starting letter of city N+1"" does not hold true for the entire given sequence. However, in many riddles of this type, the pattern is established by the items in the list, and the rule derived is applied specifically to the *last* item to find the *next* item. The sequence provided serves to demonstrate the *type* of pattern being used (based on letters of names), and the rule is then used for the final step. The most common pattern of this type is indeed linking the end of one name to the start of the next.

6.  **Apply the Rule to the Last Item:** Assuming the pattern that determines the *next* destination is based on the *last* destination provided:
    *   The last destination is Panama Cit**y**.

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.

Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.

...got it?",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the six men be Alan (A), Boris (B), Chuck (C), Dalman (D), Edwin (E), and Finney (F). There are three Paley brothers (P) and three Thomson brothers (T). Three men are truth-tellers (TT) and three are liars (LL). Neither set of brothers consists exclusively of liars, meaning each family has at least one truth-teller.

Let's analyze the statements:
1.  Alan: ""Both my brothers tell lies.""
2.  Boris: ""Both my brothers tell the truth.""
3.  Chuck: ""Alan and Boris are both liars.""
4.  Dalman: ""Chuck and I are brothers.""
5.  Edwin: ""Boris and I are brothers.""
6.  Finney: ""Edwin tells the truth.""
7.  Finney: ""Boris is one of the Paleys.""

Let's use T for truth-teller and L for liar.
Statement 6: Finney says ""Edwin tells the truth.""
- If Finney is T, the statement is true, so Edwin is T.
- If Finney is L, the statement is false, so Edwin is L.
Thus, Finney and Edwin have the same status: Status(F) = Status(E).

There are two possibilities for (Status(F), Status(E)): (T, T) or (L, L).

Case 1: (F, E) = (T, T). Both Finney and Edwin are truth-tellers.
Statement 7: Finney is T, so his statement ""Boris is one of the Paleys"" is true. Boris is a Paley.
Statement 5: Edwin is T, so his statement ""Boris and I are brothers"" is true. Edwin and Boris are brothers. Since Boris is a Paley, Edwin must also be a Paley.
So, Boris and Edwin are Paley brothers. The Paley family consists of Boris, Edwin, and one other person from {A, C, D, F}.
Finney is T. If Finney were the third Paley brother, then P = {B, E, F}. Their statuses would be (B=?, E=T, F=T).
Statement 2: Boris says ""Both my brothers tell the truth."" Boris's brothers would be Edwin and Finney. Both are T.
- If Boris were T, $S_B$ (""Both E and F are T"") would be true, consistent with B being T. So {B, E, F} could be all TT.
- If Boris were L, $S_B$ (""Both E and F are T"") would be true, inconsistent with B being L. So B cannot be L if P={B,E,F}.
So if P = {B, E, F}, all three must be TT. This would mean $S_{TT}=\{B, E, F\}$, and $S_{LL}=\{A, C, D\}$. This implies that the Thomson family {A, C, D} are all liars. This contradicts the constraint that neither set of brothers consists exclusively of liars.
Therefore, Finney is not the third Paley brother. Finney must be a Thomson.

So, if (F, E) = (T, T), then Boris is Paley, Edwin is Paley, and Finney is Thomson.
$P = \{B, E, X\}$ where X is one of {A, C, D}. $T = \{F, Y, Z\}$ where {Y, Z} = {A, C, D} \ {X}.
Statuses so far: E(T), F(T). $S_{TT}$ contains {E, F}. We need one more TT. $S_{LL}$ contains 3 people.

Statement 2: Boris says ""Both my brothers tell the truth."" His brothers are E and X. E is T.

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to determine if a contract to use a truck carrying 22 tons of water to supply a canal with 13 locks, which loses 7000 L per lock use and has no top supply, is ""reasonable"". ""Reasonable"" in this context likely means whether the truck's capacity is sufficient or practical for the task of supplying the needed water.

2.  **Identify the Water Need:**
    *   There are 13 locks.
    *   Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
    *   There is no water supply at the top.

3.  **Interpret ""Lock Use"" and ""Water Loss"":** In a flight of locks, when a boat goes *up*, water is drawn from the pound *above* each lock to fill the lock chamber. This water is then discharged to the pound *below* when the boat exits the lock at the higher level. Since there's no water supply at the top, this water that is moved downwards through the flight must be replaced at the top level to maintain sufficient depth for continued operation, especially for future upward passages. The 7000 L loss per lock is most likely referring to this volume of water that needs to be replenished at the higher level (ultimately the top pound) for every upward passage through that lock.

4.  **Calculate Total Water Needed Per Upward Passage:**
    *   To pass one boat *up* through the entire flight of 13 locks, water is effectively moved from higher levels to lower levels at each lock.
    *   The total volume of water moved down through the entire flight for one boat going up is the sum of the water used from each pound above each lock.
    *   Total water needing replenishment at the top = Number of locks * Water loss per lock
    *   Total water needed = 13 locks * 7000 L/lock = 91000 L.
    *   This 91000 L of water must be transported from the bottom (where the water ends up) back up to the top.

5.  **Determine the Truck's Capacity in Liters:**
    *   The truck capacity is 22 tons of water.
    *   The density of fresh water is approximately 1 tonne per cubic meter (1000 kg/m³).
    *   1 cubic meter (m³) = 1000 Liters (L).
    *   So, 1 tonne of water ≈ 1000 kg ≈ 1000 L.
    *   Truck capacity in Liters = 22 tons * 1000 L/ton = 22000 L.

6.  **Compare Water Needed to Truck Capacity:**
    *   Water needed at the top *per boat passage up the flight*: 91000 L.
    *   Truck capacity *per trip*: 22000 L.

7.  **Calculate Number of Truck Trips Needed Per Upward Passage:**
    *   Number of trips = Total water needed / Truck capacity per trip
    *   Number of trips = 91000 L / 22000 L/trip = 91 / 22 ≈ 4.136 trips.
    *   Since the truck must complete full trips, it needs to make 5 trips to carry enough water (5 * 22000 L = 110000 L) to replenish the amount effectively lost from the top system when one boat goes up the entire flight.

8.  **Evaluate Reasonableness of the Contract:**
    *   The contract involves using a truck with a capacity of 22000 L per trip to supply water to a system where 91000 L is needed at the top for every boat that goes up the entire flight.
    *   A single trip by this truck provides only 22000 L, which is less than one-quarter of the water needed for one boat to ascend the flight.
    *   To support just *one* boat going up, the truck would need to make 5 round trips from the bottom to the top.
    *   Canal locks are often used by multiple boats daily. If several boats use the canal, the required water transport quickly increases to many truckloads per day.
    *   Given the large volume of water required per boat passage (91000 L) compared to the relatively small volume the truck can carry per trip (22000 L), relying solely on this truck to maintain the necessary water levels for typical canal usage appears highly inefficient and labour-intensive.
    *   Therefore, the contract is likely not reasonable *as a primary solution* for supplying the necessary water to keep the canal operational for anything more than very infrequent use, due to the mismatch between the truck's capacity and the volume of water needed. If the contract is for a single delivery or very limited service, it might be ""reasonable"" for that specific task, but it doesn't address the underlying problem of supplying enough water for regular operation. The question implies the contract is intended to address the water supply problem.

Final answer: No, the contract is likely not reasonable as a sufficient solution for supplying water to the canal for typical operation. A single boat going up the flight of 13 locks requires approximately 91000 L of water to be replenished at the top. The truck can only carry 22000 L per trip. This means the truck would need to make 5 trips just to supply enough water for one boat to ascend the entire flight. For regular canal usage with multiple boats, this would require a very large number of truck journeys, making it impractical and likely very expensive compared to other potential solutions like pumping or finding an alternative water source.",True

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break down this scenario step by step, applying careful logic to figure out Company B's clever and honest offer.

1.  **Initial Situation:** The Emperor needs a bridge for a ""difficult and dangerous"" job.
    *   Company A offers to do it for $800,000. We can assume this is the price for a successfully completed bridge. What happens if Company A fails? The story doesn't explicitly say, but in a standard contract for such a risky job, the payment structure is key. Let's consider possibilities later.
    *   Company B states they cannot do it for less than $1,000,000. This is Company B's price for a successfully completed bridge, reflecting their assessment of the difficulty and cost involved.

2.  **Company B's New Offer:** Contractor B returns with a seemingly strange offer: the Emperor *can pay* $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 *for the job*. The crucial phrase here is ""for the job."" This doesn't sound like the Emperor gets to just pick a price for the exact same service. Instead, the different payment amounts must be tied to different *outcomes* of the job, especially given that it's described as ""difficult and dangerous.""

3.  **Interpreting Company B's Offer Structure:** Given the high risk and the tiered payment options, the most logical interpretation is that these are not selectable prices for the same service, but rather pre-agreed payment amounts contingent on the *degree of success* achieved in building the bridge.
    *   The highest amount, $1,000,000, aligns with Company B's initial stated minimum for the completed job. This is almost certainly the payment for *successful completion* of the bridge.
    *   The lowest amount, $200,000, is much lower than the cost of building the bridge. This must represent the payment in the worst-case scenario for Company B – complete *failure* to build the bridge. This payment would likely cover some initial costs, planning, or effort, but not the full cost or profit for a successful build.
    *   The middle amount, $750,000, likely represents an intermediate outcome – perhaps partial completion, completion with significant issues or delays, or reaching a major milestone short of full success.

4.  **Hypothesizing the Contract Terms:** Based on this, Company B's offer was likely structured as follows:
    *   ""We will attempt to build the bridge. We agree to the following payment terms based on the outcome of our work:
        *   If we fail to complete the bridge: You will pay us $200,000.
        *   If we partially complete the bridge, or complete it with significant issues: You will pay us $750,000.
        *   If we successfully complete the bridge as agreed: You will pay us $1,000,000.""

5.  **Why the Emperor Accepted (Why it Sounded So Good):** Now, compare this offer structure to Company A's offer of $800,000.
    *   Company A's offer of $800,000 was likely either:
        *   a) $800,000 upon successful completion (meaning the Emperor pays nothing if they fail).
        *   b) A fixed price of $800,000 for undertaking the project, regardless of outcome (meaning the Emperor pays $800,000 even if they fail).

    *   If Company A's offer was (a) – $800k for success, $0 for failure – then Company B's offer is worse in *both* success ($1M vs $800k) and failure ($200k vs $0) scenarios. This doesn't explain why the Emperor ""immediately accepted"" B's offer as one he ""cannot refuse.""

    *   Therefore, Company A's offer must have been (b) – a fixed price of $800,000 paid to Company A *for the attempt*, meaning the Emperor would pay $800,000 even if Company A failed to build the bridge. Given the ""difficult and dangerous"" nature of the job, this kind of cost-plus or fixed-fee-for-effort contract might have been A's proposal to mitigate *their* risk of losing money on a failure.

    *   Now compare Company B's offer (payments based on outcome) to Company A's likely offer (fixed price for the attempt):
        *   **Worst Case (Failure):** With Company A, the Emperor pays $800,000 and gets no bridge. With Company B, the Emperor pays only $200,000 and gets no bridge. Company B's offer drastically limits the Emperor's financial risk if the project fails.
        *   **Best Case (Success):** With Company A, the Emperor pays $800,000 and gets a bridge. With Company B, the Emperor pays $1,000,000 and gets a bridge. The Emperor pays more for success with B, but the *downside protection* offered by B in case of failure ($200k vs $800k) is immense.

    *   The ""offer you cannot refuse"" was the significant reduction in the Emperor's risk. The Emperor was willing to pay a premium ($1M vs $800k) if the project succeeded, in exchange for only paying a minimal amount ($200k vs $800k) if the project failed. This shows the Emperor was confident in the likelihood of success (perhaps trusting B's higher initial price meant higher quality or capability) and prioritized limiting his losses in the worst-case scenario.

6.  **How Company B Ended Up With $1,000,000:** The riddle states that Company B ""ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job."" Under the terms of the contract they agreed upon, the $1,000,000 payment was for the *successful completion* of the bridge. This means Company B successfully built the bridge as agreed.

7.  **Honesty:** Contractor B was completely honest. He laid out the potential costs based on the project's outcome. The Emperor understood the terms – higher payment for success, much lower payment for failure (and an intermediate payment for partial success) – and freely chose this structure because it significantly protected him financially in the event of a difficult and dangerous project failing. Company B simply delivered successfully and was paid the agreed-upon price for that success.

In essence, Company B's offer wasn't about choosing a price for the service, but about agreeing to a payment structure that allocated the risk of failure primarily to themselves (by accepting a much lower payment in case of failure than A seemingly demanded). This risk mitigation for the Emperor made the offer incredibly attractive, despite the higher potential cost in the success scenario.

Final answer: Company B's offer sounded so good to the Emperor because it significantly reduced the Emperor's financial risk in the event the difficult and dangerous bridge project failed. Company A's offer was likely a fixed price of $800,000 paid regardless of success, meaning the Emperor would pay $800,000 even if no bridge was built. Company B offered a tiered payment structure contingent on the outcome: $200,000 if they completely failed, $750,000 for partial success or issues, and $1,000,000 for successful completion. This meant the Emperor would only pay $200,000 (or $750,000) instead of $800,000 if the project didn't result in a complete bridge, making the potential downside much less severe. The Emperor accepted this offer because the benefit of reduced risk in the failure scenario outweighed the higher cost in the success scenario. Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 because they successfully completed the bridge, triggering the highest payment amount as agreed upon in the contract. Contractor B did not lie or cheat; he offered a payment structure based on potential project outcomes, and Company B achieved the outcome corresponding to the highest payment.",True
58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.

2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let $N$ be the number of friends in the group initially.
Let $T$ be the total number of Golden kebab tokens.
Initially, the tokens were divided equally among the $N$ friends. Let $t_f$ be the number of tokens each friend received.
So, $T = N \cdot t_f$.
We are given that $N < 10$. Since it's a group of friends, $N$ must be an integer greater than 1.

Next, a division by families was suggested.
The group of friends consists of:
- Two groups of two sisters (4 friends). These form 2 families.
- Norha Bone (NB), who is not in either group of sisters. She forms her own family. (1 friend, 1 family)
- The rest of the friends, who are unrelated to each other and to the sisters and NB. Let $k$ be the number of these friends. Each of these friends forms their own family. ($k$ friends, $k$ families)

The total number of friends is $N = 4 + 1 + k = 5 + k$. Since $k \ge 0$, $N \ge 5$.
The total number of families is $F = 2 + 1 + k = 3 + k$.
Substituting $k = N-5$, we get $F = 3 + (N-5) = N-2$.

In the re-division by families, the total tokens $T$ would be divided equally among the $F$ families. Let $t_{fam}$ be the number of tokens per family.
So, $T = F \cdot t_{fam}$.
We are told that $t_{fam}$ would be 5 more than $t_f$.
$t_{fam} = t_f + 5$.

Substituting $T = N \cdot t_f$ and $F = N-2$ into $T = F \cdot t_{fam}$:
$N \cdot t_f = (N-2) \cdot (t_f + 5)$
$N t_f = N t_f + 5N - 2t_f - 10$
$0 = 5N - 2t_f - 10$
$2t_f = 5N - 10$
$t_f = \frac{5N - 10}{2}$

Since $t_f$ must be an integer (number of tokens), $5N - 10$ must be an even number. $5(N-2)$ must be even. Since 5 is odd, $N-2$ must be even. This means $N$ must be an even number.

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field

61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.

As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

$S_1$: ""You chose 'True' at most once."" This means $N_T \le 1$.
$S_2$: ""You chose 'False' at most once."" This means $N_F \le 1$.
$S_3$: ""You chose 'True' at most twice."" This means $N_T \le 2$.

$S_9$: ""You chose 'True' at most five times."" This means $N_T \le 5$.
$S_{10}$: ""You chose 'False' at most five times."" This means $N_F \le 5$.

The choices must be consistent. This means that if I choose a statement to be ""True"", then the statement must be true given all my choices. If I choose a statement to be ""False"", then the statement must be false given all my choices.
Let $C_i$ be my choice for statement $S_i$. $C_i$ is ""True"" if $S_i$ is true based on the values of $N_T$ and $N_F$ determined by all choices, and ""False"" if $S_i$ is false.

So, the $i$-th statement is true if and only if I choose ""True"" for the $i$-th statement. This means $N_T$ must be equal to the number of statements that are true.

Let's rephrase the conditions based on $N_T$ (since $N_F = 10 - N_T$):
$S_1$ is true if $N_T \le 1$.
$S_2$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 1 \iff N_T \ge 9$.
$S_3$ is true if $N_T \le 2$.
$S_4$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 2 \iff N_T \ge 8$.
$S_5$ is true if $N_T \le 3$.
$S_6$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 3 \iff N_T \ge 7$.
$S_7$ is true if $N_T \le 4$.
$S_8$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 4 \iff N_T \ge 6$.
$S_9$ is true if $N_T \le 5$.
$S_{10}$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 5 \iff N_T \ge 5$.

Let $T(N_T)$ be the number of statements that are true for a given value of $N_T$. For the choices to be consistent, the number of true statements must equal $N_T$. So we need to find $N_T$ such that $T(N_T) = N_T$.

2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5

2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

79,How is it possible that 3 + 4 = 5?,,"Using VECTORS
i.e. 3 m North + 4 m East
= 5 metres North East
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
9 + 16 = 25
SQ Root of 25 = 5",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"That's a great question that highlights how mathematical notation can be used in different contexts beyond simple arithmetic!

In standard arithmetic, 3 + 4 always equals 7. So, the statement ""3 + 4 = 5"" is impossible in that context.

However, the equation becomes possible if the symbols ""3"", ""4"", ""+"", or ""5"" represent something different from standard integer values and addition. The most common way this equation makes sense is in the context of **geometry** or **vector addition**, specifically involving a **right triangle**.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Consider a Right Triangle:** Think about a right triangle, which has one angle that measures 90 degrees.
2.  **Sides of a Right Triangle:** The two sides that form the right angle are called the legs, and the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse.
3.  **The Pythagorean Theorem:** For any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs (a and b). This is expressed by the formula: a² + b² = c².
4.  **Applying to 3, 4, and 5:** The numbers 3, 4, and 5 form a well-known Pythagorean triple because they fit this theorem:
    *   Let the lengths of the legs be a = 3 and b = 4.
    *   Calculate the sum of the squares of the legs: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25.
    *   Now, consider the number 5. The square of 5 is 5² = 25.
    *   Since 3² + 4² = 5² (because 25 = 25), a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4 will have a hypotenuse of length 5.

5.  **Relating to ""3 + 4 = 5"":**
    *   Imagine the '+' symbol in the equation ""3 + 4 = 5"" doesn't mean arithmetic sum, but rather the *combination* or *composition* of quantities that are oriented at a right angle.
    *   Think of adding displacements: If you travel 3 units in one direction (say, East) and then 4 units in a direction perpendicular to the first (say, North), your final displacement from the starting point is not 3 + 4 = 7 units in a straight line. Instead, the path taken forms the two legs of a right triangle. The straight-line distance (magnitude of the total displacement) from your start to your end point is the length of the hypotenuse.
    *   Using the Pythagorean theorem for this 3-unit leg and 4-unit leg, the hypotenuse has a length of √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5.
    *   In this context, where '+' represents the combination of orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors or displacements, the ""sum"" of a 3-unit displacement and a 4-unit displacement is a resultant displacement with a magnitude of 5 units.

So, the equation 3 + 4 = 5 is possible when:

*   '3' and '4' represent the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle.
*   '+' represents the geometric combination of these legs (resulting in the hypotenuse).
*   '5' represents the length of the hypotenuse.

Or, more generally:

*   '3' and '4' represent the magnitudes of two vectors.
*   '+' represents vector addition.
*   '5' represents the magnitude of the resultant vector, specifically when the two original vectors are perpendicular.

Final answer: It is possible that 3 + 4 = 5 if the numbers 3, 4, and 5 represent the lengths of the sides of a right triangle (legs 3 and 4, hypotenuse 5), and the '+' symbol represents the geometric combination of the two legs to form the hypotenuse, as described by the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²). This is also equivalent to adding two perpendicular vectors of magnitudes 3 and 4, resulting in a vector with magnitude 5.",True

Reverse the order of the numbers given, then from beginning to end, that is the number of the letter in each word; once you have all 6 letters reverse them and that forms the password.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  The problem states that the hacker sent an email containing the phrase ""wish about happiness but never ask"" and the number sequence ""341223"". This information was used by Mad Ade to find the new password.
2.  I will analyze the components of the clue. The phrase is ""wish about happiness but never ask"". The number sequence is ""341223"".
3.  I count the number of words in the phrase: ""wish"" (1), ""about"" (2), ""happiness"" (3), ""but"" (4), ""never"" (5), ""ask"" (6). There are six words.
4.  I count the number of digits in the sequence: 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3. There are six digits.
5.  The fact that there are six words and six digits suggests a direct correspondence between them. A common way to encode information using a phrase and numbers is to use the numbers to indicate letter positions within the words.
6.  I hypothesize that each digit in the sequence corresponds to the word at the same position in the phrase. That is, the 1st digit (3) corresponds to the 1st word (""wish""), the 2nd digit (4) corresponds to the 2nd word (""about""), the 3rd digit (1) corresponds to the 3rd word (""happiness""), the 4th digit (2) corresponds to the 4th word (""but""), the 5th digit (2) corresponds to the 5th word (""never""), and the 6th digit (3) corresponds to the 6th word (""ask"").
7.  I hypothesize that each digit indicates which letter to extract from its corresponding word, based on its position (index). It is standard in such puzzles to use 1-based indexing, where the first letter of a word is at position 1, the second at position 2, and so on.
8.  Applying this hypothesis for the first word and digit: The first word is ""wish"". The first digit is 3. The 3rd letter of ""wish"" is 's'.
9.  Applying this hypothesis for the second word and digit: The second word is ""about"". The second digit is 4. The 4th letter of ""about"" is 'u'.
10. Applying this hypothesis for the third word and digit: The third word is ""happiness"". The third digit is 1. The 1st letter of ""happiness"" is 'h'.
11. Applying this hypothesis for the fourth word and digit: The fourth word is ""but"". The fourth digit is 2. The 2nd letter of ""but"" is 'u'.
12. Applying this hypothesis for the fifth word and digit: The fifth word is ""never"". The fifth digit is 2. The 2nd letter of ""never"" is 'e'.
13. Applying this hypothesis for the sixth word and digit: The sixth word is ""ask"". The sixth digit is 3. The 3rd letter of ""ask"" is 'k'.
14. The letters extracted in order are 's', 'u', 'h', 'u', 'e', 'k'.
15. Concatenating these letters forms the string ""suhuek"".
16. This method uses all components of the clue in a logical and relatively simple way, which explains how Mad Ade could find the password quickly (""within a few minutes"").

7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.

7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.

97,"Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.

1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.

Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.", it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true,"Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years
Tolo, 12 hands, 120 years
Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

There are seven days in a week.
Gee (G) is the seventh letter in the alphabet.
There are 7 different notes in a musical scale. (Excluding the repeated letter)
Gun is the odd man out.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's examine the words and look for patterns or properties they share, and how one might differ.

The words are:
Die
Day
Gee
Gun
Scale

Let's consider various attributes:

1.  **Length (number of letters):**
    *   Die: 3 letters
    *   Day: 3 letters
    *   Gee: 3 letters
    *   Gun: 3 letters
    *   Scale: 5 letters

    Based on length, four of the words have 3 letters, while one word (""Scale"") has 5 letters. This is a strong potential pattern.

2.  **Starting letter:**
    *   Die: D
    *   Day: D
    *   Gee: G
    *   Gun: G
    *   Scale: S
    Two words start with D, two with G, one with S. This doesn't clearly single out one word from the other four.

3.  **Ending letter:**
    *   Die: e
    *   Day: y
    *   Gee: e
    *   Gun: n
    *   Scale: e
    Three words end in 'e', one in 'y', one in 'n'. This doesn't clearly single out one word from the other four.

4.  **Vowel sound/Rhyme:**
    *   Die: rhymes with ""high"" (/aɪ/)
    *   Day: rhymes with ""say"" (/eɪ/)
    *   Gee: rhymes with ""see"" (/iː/)
    *   Gun: rhymes with ""sun"" (/ʌn/)
    *   Scale: rhymes with ""pale"" (/eɪl/)
    Day and Scale share the /eɪ/ sound, but end differently. The sounds are mostly distinct, making it hard to group four together based on sound alone.

5.  **Meaning/Category:**
    *   Die: (cube for games), (tool), (to stop living)
    *   Day: (time period)
    *   Gee: (exclamation/direction), (letter 'G')
    *   Gun: (weapon)
    *   Scale: (measurement tool), (size), (fish part), (climb), (music)
    The meanings are quite diverse, making it difficult to find a clear semantic group of four.

The most obvious and consistent pattern is the length of the words. Four words are exactly three letters long, while ""Scale"" is five letters long.

Therefore, ""Scale"" is the odd one out because it is the only word with more than three letters.

Final answer: Scale",True

How can you create two subgroups of pennies, each with the same number of heads facing up, while remaining blindfolded?",You can flip some subgroup of the pennies!,"Create a subgroup of any 128 pennies. Then flip over all 128. That group of 128 and the group of all the remaining pennies will have the same number of heads facing up.
This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:

1.  **Understand the initial state:** We have a large number of pennies (let's call the total number N). We know exactly 128 of these pennies are heads up (H=128), and the rest are tails up (T = N - 128). We are blindfolded, meaning we cannot see the faces of the pennies.

2.  **Understand the goal:** We need to create two distinct subgroups of pennies. Let's call them Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 2. The requirement is that the number of heads facing up in Subgroup 1 must be equal to the number of heads facing up in Subgroup 2. The subgroups do not necessarily need to have the same number of pennies.

3.  **Identify allowed actions:** Since we are blindfolded, we cannot identify heads from tails by sight. However, we can perform physical manipulations like counting pennies, separating them into groups, and flipping them over.

4.  **Devise a strategy based on the known number of heads:** We know the total number of heads is 128. This specific number must be key to the solution. What if we create a subgroup containing exactly 128 pennies? We can do this by picking up pennies one by one and counting them until we have 128.

5.  **Execute the strategy (in thought experiment):**
    *   Step 1: Reach onto the table and begin picking up pennies. Count them as you pick them up. Set these pennies aside in a separate pile. Continue until you have collected exactly 128 pennies. This pile is Subgroup 1.
    *   Step 2: The remaining pennies on the table form Subgroup 2.

6.  **Analyze the composition of the subgroups:**
    *   Subgroup 1 contains 128 pennies. Let's say, before any further manipulation, this subgroup contains H1 heads and T1 tails. Since the total number of pennies in this subgroup is 128, we know H1 + T1 = 128.
    *   Subgroup 2 contains the remaining N - 128 pennies. Let's say this subgroup contains H2 heads and T2 tails. So, H2 + T2 = N - 128.

7.  **Relate the subgroups to the initial state:** The total number of heads on the table initially was 128. These heads were distributed between what is now Subgroup 1 and Subgroup 2. So, the total number of heads is H1 + H2 = 128.

8.  **Consider manipulation to equalize heads:** We need the number of heads in Subgroup 1 to equal the number of heads in Subgroup 2. Currently, we have H1 heads in Subgroup 1 and H2 heads in Subgroup 2. We know H1 + H2 = 128. How can we make the number of heads equal?

9.  **Propose flipping as a manipulation:** The only other action we can perform is flipping pennies. What if we flip all the pennies in Subgroup 1?
    *   Step 3: Take each of the 128 pennies in Subgroup 1 and flip it over.

10. **Analyze the state after flipping Subgroup 1:**
    *   Before flipping, Subgroup 1 had H1 heads and T1 tails.
    *   After flipping, the H1 heads become tails, and the T1 tails become heads.
    *   So, after flipping, Subgroup 1 now has T1 heads and H1 tails. Let's call the new number of heads in Subgroup 1, H1'. So, H1' = T1.
    *   Subgroup 2 remains unchanged. It still has H2 heads and T2 tails.

11. **Check if the number of heads are now equal:** We need to compare H1' (the number of heads in Subgroup 1 after flipping) and H2 (the number of heads in Subgroup 2).
    *   From our analysis of Subgroup 1 before flipping, we know H1 + T1 = 128. Therefore, T1 = 128 - H1. So, H1' = 128 - H1.
    *   From our analysis of the total heads initially, we know H1 + H2 = 128. Therefore, H2 = 128 - H1.

12. **Conclusion:** Comparing H1' and H2, we see that H1' = 128 - H1 and H2 = 128 - H1. Therefore, H1' = H2. The number of heads in Subgroup 1 (after flipping) is equal to the number of heads in Subgroup 2.

13. **Final procedure:** The procedure that achieves the goal blindfolded is:
    a. Count out exactly 128 pennies from the table and set them aside as Subgroup 1.
    b. The remaining pennies on the table form Subgroup 2.
    c. Flip over every single penny in Subgroup 1.

This process results in two subgroups (Subgroup 1 with 128 pennies, Subgroup 2 with N-128 pennies) that each contain the same number of heads facing up. The exact number of heads in each group will be 128 minus the number of heads that were randomly picked up in the initial group of 128. Since we don't need to know this number, and the logic holds regardless of what H1 is, the procedure works blindfolded.

Final answer: Count out 128 pennies and set them aside as the first subgroup. The remaining pennies on the table form the second subgroup. Flip over every single penny in the first subgroup of 128. The two subgroups will now have the same number of heads facing up.",True

Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.
Mr. Simkin suggests to Gretchen that she may have a career in law enforcement if she can further hone these impressive deductive reasoning skills.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The puzzle requires finding ten words (W1 to W10) that match given descriptions, such that the last two letters of W_i are the first two letters of W_{i+1} for i=1 to 9, and the last two letters of W10 are the first two letters of W1.

Let's list the descriptions and the letter constraints:
1. To prevent by fear (W1) - ??... ends L2(W1)
2. One of the muses (W2) - L2(W1)... ends L2(W2)
3. Often on the breakfast table (W3) - L2(W2)... ends L2(W3)
4. Steps for passing over a fence (W4) - L2(W3)... ends L2(W4)
5. Lawful (W5) - L2(W4)... ends L2(W5)
6. Solitary (W6) - L2(W5)... ends L2(W6)
7. A musical Roman emperor (W7) - L2(W6)... ends L2(W7)
8. A bird (W8) - L2(W7)... ends L2(W8)
9. To bury (W9) - L2(W8)... ends L2(W9)
10. To eat into (W10) - L2(W9)... ends L2(W10)
Finally, L2(W10) must be the first two letters of W1.

Some descriptions are more specific than others, providing good starting points.
W4: Steps for passing over a fence. A common word for this is STILE. Let's assume W4 = STILE.
If W4 = STILE, its last two letters are LE.
This means W3 must end in LE, and W5 must start with LE.

Let's work forward from W4=STILE:
W5: Starts with LE. Description: Lawful. A word matching this is LEGAL. Let's assume W5 = LEGAL.
L2(W5) = AL.
W6: Starts with AL. Description: Solitary. A word matching this is ALONE. Let's assume W6 = ALONE.
L2(W6) = NE.
W7: Starts with NE. Description: A musical Roman emperor. The most famous is NERO. Let's assume W7 = NERO.
L2(W7) = RO.
W8: Starts with RO. Description: A bird. A common bird is ROBIN. Let's assume W8 = ROBIN.
L2(W8) = IN.
W9: Starts with IN. Description: To bury. A word for this is INTER. Let's assume W9 = INTER.
L2(W9) = ER.
W10: Starts with ER. Description: To eat into. A word for this is ERODE. Let's assume W10 = ERODE.
L2(W10) = DE.

According to the rules, L2(W10) must be the first two letters of W1.
So, W1 must start with DE. Description: To prevent by fear. A word matching this is DETER. Let's assume W1 = DETER.
L2(W1) = ER.

Now, let's work backward from W1=DETER to see if the chain connects correctly.
W2: Starts with L2(W1) = ER. Description: One of the muses. The muses are Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia, Urania. ERATO starts with ER. Let's assume W2 = ERATO.
L2(W2) = TO.
W3: Starts with L2(W2) = TO. Description: Often on the breakfast table. A word matching this is TOAST. Let's assume W3 = TOAST.
L2(W3) = ST.

Now, we check if this links correctly to our starting assumption for W4.
W4: Starts with L2(W3) = ST. Description: Steps for passing over a fence. Our initial assumption was W4 = STILE, which starts with ST. This matches.

Let's verify the entire loop and all descriptions:
W1: DETER (To prevent by fear). Ends in ER.
W2: ERATO (One of the muses). Starts with ER. Ends in TO. (ER->ER link works)
W3: TOAST (Often on the breakfast table). Starts with TO. Ends in ST. (TO->TO link works)
W4: STILE (Steps for passing over a fence). Starts with ST. Ends in LE. (ST->ST link works)
W5: LEGAL (Lawful). Starts with LE. Ends in AL. (LE->LE link works)
W6: ALONE (Solitary). Starts with AL. Ends in NE. (AL->AL link works)
W7: NERO (A musical Roman emperor). Starts with NE. Ends in RO. (NE->NE link works)
W8: ROBIN (A bird). Starts with RO. Ends in IN. (RO->RO link works)
W9: INTER (To bury). Starts with IN. Ends in ER. (IN->IN link works)
W10: ERODE (To eat into). Starts with ER. Ends in DE. (ER->ER link works)
W1: DETER. Starts with DE. (DE->DE link works, closing the loop)

All words fit their descriptions, and all the two-letter links between words are correct.

The list of words in order is:
1. DETER
2. ERATO
3. TOAST
4. STILE
5. LEGAL
6. ALONE
7. NERO
8. ROBIN
9. INTER
10. ERODE

Final check:
DETER (ER) -> ERATO (TO) -> TOAST (ST) -> STILE (LE) -> LEGAL (AL) -> ALONE (NE) -> NERO (RO) -> ROBIN (IN) -> INTER (ER) -> ERODE (DE) -> DETER (DE)
All links are correct.

108,"In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.  So in reality he left them all the same thing.,GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"This is a classic riddle! Let's break down the apparent contradiction.

1.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The core of the problem is the statement that Stu Pidfule treated each child ""equally"" and ""in a way he did,"" even though they all got ""different amounts"" of money. This seems impossible if ""treated equally"" means ""gave the same amount of money to.""

2.  **Look for a Different Meaning of ""Equally"":** The phrase ""in a way he did"" is a strong hint that the definition of ""equally"" being used is not the standard one related to the final amount of money. It must refer to something else about the distribution process or the basis for the distribution.

3.  **Consider What Was Different About Each Child:** The riddle explicitly mentions the children's names: Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy. These are the only unique identifiers given for each child in the context of receiving the money.

4.  **Hypothesize a Rule Based on the Unique Identifier (Names):** What if the ""equal treatment"" was applying the exact same *rule* or *formula* to determine the amount of money, and that rule was based on something about their names? If the names are different in some quantifiable way, applying the same rule to each name could result in different amounts.

5.  **Test a Simple Rule Based on Names:** The simplest quantifiable difference between the names is their length (number of letters).
    *   Derek: 5 letters
    *   Eric: 4 letters
    *   Monkeyboy: 9 letters

6.  **Apply the Hypothetical Rule:** Let's assume Stu decided to give each child a fixed amount of money *per letter* in their name. For example, $1000 per letter.
    *   Derek would receive 5 letters * $1000/letter = $5000
    *   Eric would receive 4 letters * $1000/letter = $4000
    *   Monkeyboy would receive 9 letters * $1000/letter = $9000

7.  **Check if the Hypothesis Satisfies the Conditions:**
    *   Did they get different amounts? Yes ($5000, $4000, $9000 are different).
    *   Was Stu treating them equally ""in a way""? Yes, he applied the *same rule* ($1000 per letter) to each child. The method of calculation was equal, even if the outcome (the final amount) was different because their names had different lengths.

8.  **Conclusion:** The equality was in the method or rule used to calculate the amount, which was based on a characteristic unique to each child (their name).

Final answer: Stu Pidfule treated his children equally by applying the exact same rule or formula to determine how much money each would receive. This rule was based on a characteristic that was different for each child, specifically, it was based on their names. For example, he might have decided to give each child a certain amount of money for every letter in their name. Since Derek, Eric, and Monkeyboy have names of different lengths, applying the same rule to each name resulted in them receiving different amounts of money.",True

Rosina - nay, nay, aye, aye, nay
Sven - nay, aye, nay, aye, nay",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the five council members be Quincy (Q), Orlando (O), Penny (P), Rosina (R), and Sven (S). Let the five proposals be P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. Each member casts an Aye (A) or Nay (N) vote for each proposal. There are 5*5 = 25 total votes.

Let A_j be the number of Aye votes for proposal j, and N_j be the number of Nay votes for proposal j. For each proposal, A_j + N_j = 5.

We analyze the clues:
1.  Each proposal got a different number of aye votes. So, the set {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5} contains 5 distinct integers. The possible number of aye votes for a proposal is an integer from 0 to 5. Thus, the set of A_j values must be 5 distinct numbers from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
2.  Total Aye votes = Total Nay votes + 1. Total votes = 25. Let Total_A be the sum of A_j and Total_N be the sum of N_j. Total_A + Total_N = 25 and Total_A = Total_N + 1. This gives 2*Total_N + 1 = 25, so Total_N = 12 and Total_A = 13.
    The sum of the distinct A_j values must be 13. The possible values are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Sum of all six is 15. To get a sum of 13 from 5 distinct values, we must exclude a value such that the sum of the remaining five is 13. Excluding 2 gives {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}, which sums to 0+1+3+4+5 = 13. Excluding any other number from {0,1,2,3,4,5} does not result in a sum of 13. So, the set of Aye votes for the five proposals {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5} is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} in some order.
3.  Quincy (Q) did not vote Nay on two consecutive proposals. Q's vote sequence Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 cannot contain ""NN"".
4.  Orlando (O), Penny (P), and Sven (S) voted the same way on the second proposal (P2). O2 = P2 = S2.
5.  Rosina (R) voted Aye on the fourth proposal (P4). R4 = A.
6.  Quincy (Q) and Sven (S) voted differently on P1, P2, and P3. Q1 != S1, Q2 != S2, Q3 != S3.
7.  The third proposal (P3) received one more Aye vote than the second proposal (P2). A_3 = A_2 + 1.

From Clue 7, A_3 = A_2 + 1, and {A_2, A_3} is a subset of {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}. Possible pairs (A_2, A_3) are (0, 1) or (3, 4).

Case 1: A_2 = 0, A_3 = 1.
A_2 = 0 means 0 Aye votes on P2. All 5 members voted Nay on P2. Q2=N, O2=N, P2=N, R2=N, S2=N.
This contradicts Clue 4 (O2=P2=S2). O2=P2=S2=N satisfies clue 4, but A_2 must be 0 which means everyone voted Nay.
However, let's check with Clue 6: Q2 != S2. If everyone voted N on P2, then Q2=N and S2=N. This contradicts Q2 != S2.
So, Case 1 (A_2=0, A_3=1) is not possible.

Case 2: A_2 = 3, A_3 = 4.
A_2 = 3 means 3 Aye votes on P2. From Clue 4, O2=P2=S2.
If O2=P2=S2=N, then 3 Nay votes, so A_2 = 5-3 = 2. This contradicts A_2=3.
So, O2=P2=S2=A. This means O2=A, P2=A, S2=A. These are 3 Aye votes, matching A_2=3.
The other two members (Q and R) must have voted Nay on P2 for A_2 to be 3. So Q2=N, R2=N.
Votes on P2: Q2=N, O2=A, P2=A, R2=N, S2=A. This gives A_2=3, N_2=2.

Now let's check Clue 6 with P2: Q2=N, S2=A. N != A, so Q2 != S2 is satisfied.

A_3 = 4 means 4 Aye votes on P3, so 1 Nay vote on P3.
From Clue 3, Quincy cannot vote NN. Since Q2=N, Q",True
111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the dog will eat the flower:

1.  **Identify the Agents and Their Goals:**
    *   The Dog: Wants to survive (avoid death).
    *   The Flower: Wants to survive (avoid being eaten), and dislikes making poison (but survival is a higher priority than avoiding poison-making).

2.  **Identify the Choices and the Sequence:**
    *   First, the Flower decides whether or not to develop poison.
    *   Later, the Dog decides whether or not to eat the flower.
    *   The Dog cannot observe the Flower's poison decision.

3.  **Determine the Outcomes and Preferences (for each agent):**
    *   **Outcomes for the Dog:**
        *   Eat, No Poison: Dog lives (virus cured). Best outcome for Dog.
        *   Eat, Poison: Dog dies. Worst outcome for Dog.
        *   Don't Eat: 50% chance of dying (from virus), 50% chance of living. Intermediate outcome for Dog.
        *   Dog's preference ordering: (Eat, No Poison) > (Don't Eat) > (Eat, Poison).

    *   **Outcomes for the Flower:**
        *   Not eaten, No Poison: Flower lives, no poison cost. Best outcome for Flower.
        *   Not eaten, Poison: Flower lives, incurs poison cost. Second best outcome for Flower.
        *   Eaten, No Poison: Flower dies. Worst outcome for Flower.
        *   Eaten, Poison: Flower lives, incurs poison cost (Dog dies from poison). This outcome seems impossible based on the rules (if the dog eats poison, the dog dies, but the flower *is* eaten). Let's re-read: ""If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it."" and ""But the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog."" This implies that *if the flower makes poison*, eating it kills the *dog* but presumably prevents the *flower* from being consumed to death. Yes, assumption 14 confirms: ""If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die."" It doesn't explicitly state what happens to the flower in the poison case, but the motivation for the flower to make poison (""to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog"") implies that making poison prevents the flower's demise by eating. So, if the flower makes poison and the dog eats it, the dog dies, and the flower *is not destroyed* (or at least survives in some meaningful sense, perhaps just losing the eaten part, but living). Let's assume the flower making poison means it survives the eating attempt.
        *   Let's re-evaluate the Flower's outcomes:
            *   Flower makes poison: Flower lives, incurs poison cost. (Dog's action determines if Dog lives or dies, but Flower lives).
            *   Flower doesn't make poison: If Dog eats, Flower dies. If Dog doesn't eat, Flower lives, no poison cost.

        *   Flower's preference ordering: (Live, no poison cost) > (Live, poison cost) > (Die).
            *   (Doesn't make poison, Dog doesn't eat) is best for Flower.
            *   (Makes poison) is second best for Flower (it lives, but pays the cost). This outcome is independent of whether the dog eats or not, *once poison is made*.
            *   (Doesn't make poison, Dog eats) is worst for Flower.

4.  **Apply Rationality and Common Knowledge:** Both agents are rational and know the other is rational. This means each agent will make their decision based on anticipating the other agent's rational response. The dog makes its decision *after* the flower has made its decision (about poison), but *without knowing* that decision directly. However, the dog *does* know the flower's motivations and rationality.

5.  **Reason from the Flower's Perspective (Anticipating the Dog):**
    *   The flower knows the dog is rational.
    *   The flower knows the dog wants to survive.
    *   The flower knows the dog cannot see if poison is present.
    *   The flower knows the dog's decision will depend on the dog's *belief* about whether poison is present.
    *   The flower knows the dog's preference: (Eat, No Poison) > (Don't Eat) > (Eat, Poison).
    *   The flower knows that if the dog believes there is *no* poison, the dog *will* eat (100% survival vs 50% survival).
    *   The flower knows that if the dog believes there *is* poison, the dog *will not* eat (50% survival vs 0% survival).

    *   Now the flower considers its own choice:
        *   **Option A: Don't make poison.** If the flower does this, what will the rational dog believe/do? The dog knows the flower is rational. If the flower *didn't* make poison, it must have expected *not* to be eaten (since being eaten is death for the flower). Why would the flower expect not to be eaten if it didn't make poison? Only if it expected the dog to believe there *was* poison. But that's a contradiction – the flower didn't make poison, but expected the dog to think it did? This line of reasoning seems unstable.
        *   Let's think about outcomes for the flower based on its action, assuming the dog is rational:
            *   If the flower *doesn't* make poison, and the dog is rational and correctly infers there is no poison, the dog *will* eat it, and the flower dies. This is the worst outcome for the flower.
            *   If the flower *does* make poison, the dog, being rational, will anticipate/infer the poison (we'll elaborate on this inference next), and therefore the dog *will not* eat it. The flower lives (but pays the poison cost). This is the second-best outcome for the flower.

    *   Comparing these two scenarios from the flower's perspective: Dying (if it doesn't make poison and the dog acts rationally) vs. Living with cost (if it makes poison and the dog acts rationally).
    *   Since Living (with cost) is better than Dying for the flower, the rational flower *will choose to make poison* to ensure its survival, anticipating that a rational dog will be deterred.

6.  **Reason from the Dog's Perspective (Knowing the Flower is Rational):**
    *   The dog knows the flower is rational and wants to survive, even if it has to make poison to do so.
    *   The dog knows that if the flower *doesn't* make poison, the flower dies if the dog eats it.
    *   The dog knows that if the flower *does* make poison, the flower lives if the dog doesn't eat it.
    *   The dog knows the flower prefers living (with poison cost) to dying.
    *   Therefore, the dog can deduce the flower's rational choice: The flower *must* make poison, because *not* making poison would lead to its death if the dog were rational and hungry (which it is). Making poison is the only rational way for the flower to pursue its goal of survival against a rational predator.
    *   So, the rational dog concludes, with certainty: ""The flower has made poison.""

7.  **The Dog's Final Decision:**
    *   The dog believes, based on rational deduction, that the flower has poison.
    *   If the dog eats the poisonous flower, the dog will surely die (100% chance of death).
    *   If the dog does not eat the flower, the dog has a 50% chance of dying from the virus.
    *   Comparing 100% chance of death to 50% chance of death, the rational dog chooses the option with the lower probability of death.
    *   Therefore, the dog will *not* eat the flower.

8.  **Summary:** The flower, being rational and prioritizing survival, chooses to make poison because this is the only way to deter a rational dog. The dog, being rational and knowing the flower's rationality and motivations, deduces that the flower *must* have made poison. Facing a choice between certain death (eating poison) and a 50% chance of death (not eating), the dog chooses not to eat.

Final check: Does this scenario make sense? Yes, it's a classic example of game theory reasoning (specifically, related to the Traveler's Dilemma or other games where anticipating the opponent's rationality is key). The threat of poison is credible because it is in the flower's rational self-interest to carry it out when faced with a rational predator. The dog, recognizing this, is deterred. The flower achieves its second-best outcome (lives, but paid poison cost), and the dog achieves its second-best outcome (50% survival chance, but avoids certain death). Neither can unilaterally improve their outcome given the other's rational choice.

Final Answer should be: The dog will not eat the flower, and the reasoning behind it.

**Final Answer Structure:**
1. State the conclusion: Will the dog eat the flower?
2. Explain the Flower's rational decision based on anticipating the Dog's rationality.
3. Explain the Dog's rational deduction based on the Flower's rationality.
4. Explain the Dog's final choice based on its updated belief and preferences.

Confidence Score: 5/5 - This is a standard rational agent reasoning problem.

Strategizing complete. I will now generate the response following the structure.The question is whether the dog will eat the flower. We must deduce the outcome based on the described conditions and the assumption that both the dog and the flower are perfectly rational and know the other is rational.

1.  **Analyze the Flower's Decision:** The flower's goal is survival. It also dislikes making poison, but prefers making poison and living over not making poison and dying. The flower decides whether to make poison knowing that the dog will subsequently make a decision about eating, and the dog is rational.
    *   If the flower *doesn't* make poison, a rational dog would evaluate the situation: Eating guarantees survival (by killing the virus, based on assumption 14) vs. Not eating leads to a 50% chance of death (from the virus, based on assumption 15). A rational dog would choose to eat to ensure survival (assuming the flower is not poisonous). If the dog eats a non-poisonous flower, the flower dies.
    *   If the flower *does* make poison, a rational dog would evaluate the situation: Eating leads to certain death (from poison, based on assumption 14) vs. Not eating leads to a 50% chance of death (from the virus, based on assumption 15). A rational dog would choose not to eat to avoid certain death. If the dog doesn't eat the poisonous flower, the flower lives.
    *   The flower knows this. It sees that:
        *   If it *doesn't* make poison, a rational dog will eat it, and the flower will die.
        *   If it *does* make poison, a rational dog will *not* eat it, and the flower will live (albeit having incurred the cost of making poison).
    *   The flower prefers living (even with the cost of making poison) to dying (assumptions 3 & 6). Therefore, a rational flower, anticipating the rational dog's response, will choose to make poison to ensure its survival.

2.  **Analyze the Dog's Decision:** The dog's goal is survival. The dog knows the flower is rational (assumption 10), knows the flower wants to survive (assumptions 3 & 8), knows the flower dislikes making poison but will do so if necessary for survival (assumptions 5 & 6), and knows it cannot see if the flower has poison (assumption 12).
    *   The dog simulates the rational flower's decision process (as outlined in step 1). The dog concludes that a rational flower *must* choose to make poison, because not doing so would lead to its death when faced with a rational, hungry dog. Making poison is the flower's only rational path to survival.
    *   Therefore, the dog, through rational deduction based on the flower's known rationality and motivations, concludes with certainty: ""The flower has made poison.""

3.  **The Dog's Final Choice:** Now the dog, certain that the flower has poison, must decide whether to eat it.
    *   If the dog eats the flower, which it believes is poisonous, it will surely die (100% chance of death, based on assumption 14).
    *   If the dog does not eat the flower, it faces the original situation: a 50% chance of dying from the virus (based on assumption 15).
    *   Comparing a 100% chance of death to a 50% chance of death, a rational dog chooses the option with the lower probability of death.
    *   Thus, the dog will choose not to eat the flower.

In conclusion, the flower rationally makes poison to survive against a rational dog. The dog rationally deduces that the flower must have made poison and, to avoid certain death, chooses not to eat it, facing the original 50% mortality risk from the virus instead.

115,"One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?",,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the ""Untouchable"" game problem:

1.  **Identify the Goal:** The problem asks to identify the ""untouchables"" based on the tapping pattern and rules of the game.

2.  **Analyze the Game Mechanics:** The game involves people tapping others on the shoulder. A pattern is set by the Stooges, and other groups are supposed to follow it. There is an explicit rule: ""people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.""

3.  **Catalog the Tapping Actions:**
    *   **Stooges:**
        *   Moe taps: James (2), Gandhi (2), Pope (2), Saul (2). (4 people, 2 taps each)
        *   Larry taps: Henry (1), Curly (1). (2 people, 1 tap each)
        *   Curly taps: Henry (1), Larry (1). (2 people, 1 tap each)
    *   **Kings:**
        *   James taps: Pope (2), Saul (2), Gandhi (2), Moe (2). (4 people, 2 taps each)
        *   Saul taps: Gandhi (2), Moe (2), James (2), Pope (2). (4 people, 2 taps each)
        *   Henry taps: Larry (1), Curly (1). (2 people, 1 tap each)
    *   **Queens:**
        *   Elizabeth taps: Victoria (4). (1 person, 4 taps)
        *   Victoria taps: Elizabeth (4). (1 person, 4 taps)
        *   Candace: No tapping action is described for Candace.
    *   **Religious Figures:**
        *   Pope: No tapping action (by rule).
        *   Mother Teresa: No tapping action (by rule).
        *   Gandhi: No tapping action (by rule).

4.  **Identify the Pattern Set by the Stooges:** The Stooges demonstrate two types of tapping:
    *   Moe taps 4 different people twice each.
    *   Larry and Curly tap 2 different people once each.
    The Kings appear to follow this pattern based on individual Kings: James and Saul perform the ""4 people/twice"" pattern, while Henry performs the ""2 people/once"" pattern. This suggests the pattern is about *how many* people are tapped and *how many times* by certain individuals.

5.  **Evaluate Who Followed the Pattern:**
    *   Stooges: They set the pattern.
    *   Kings: They successfully figured out and followed the pattern types (James and Saul like Moe; Henry like Larry/Curly).
    *   Queens: Elizabeth and Victoria tap only 1 person each, 4 times. This is a different pattern from the two types demonstrated by the Stooges and followed by the Kings. Candace does not tap anyone. The Queens as a group did *not* follow the established pattern.
    *   Religious Figures: They are explicitly stated *not* to tap anyone, so they cannot follow any tapping pattern.

6.  **Determine the Meaning of ""Untouchable"":** In the context of a game focused on ""tapping"" and ""following a tapping pattern,"" the term ""untouchable"" most logically refers to those who are exempt from or do not participate in the core action of *tapping*.

7.  **Apply the ""Untouchable"" Definition:**
    *   The explicit rule states that Religious Figures ""do not tap anyone."" This makes them untouchable from the perspective of being tappers in the game. This includes the Pope, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi.
    *   Looking at the actions described, Candace is not mentioned as tapping anyone. While the other Queens tap (albeit following a different pattern), Candace's described action is *not* tapping. This places her in the same category as the Religious Figures in terms of not performing the tapping action.

8.  **List the Untouchables:** Based on the rule and the described actions, the individuals who do not perform any tapping action are the untouchables.

    *   Pope (Religious Figure - by rule)
    *   Mother Teresa (Religious Figure - by rule)
    *   Gandhi (Religious Figure - by rule)
    *   Candace (Queen - by described inaction)

These are the individuals who are not involved in the game's central mechanic of tapping, either by explicit rule or by description of their actions.

Final answer: The untouchables are the Pope, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, and Candace.",True

2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

Let the four players be Al (Al Gore-Rhythm), Annie (Annie Buddyhome), Dan (Dan Druff), and Hayden (Hayden Seek).
There are 4 players, and they all play each other once. The number of games is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
In each game, 15 balls are potted, so a total of 15 points are awarded between the two players.
Let $S_{P,Q}$ be the points scored by player P in the game against player Q. We know that for any game between P and Q, $S_{P,Q} + S_{Q,P} = 15$.
Let $T_P$ be the total points scored by player P across all their games. Each player plays 3 games.
The total points distributed across all games is $6 \times 15 = 90$. The sum of the total points of all players must be 90: $T_{Al} + T_{Annie} + T_{Dan} + T_{Hayden} = 90$.

Let's analyze the given outcomes:

Outcome 3: Dan beat Hayden by 5 points in the match between them.
$S_{Dan,Hayden} - S_{Hayden,Dan} = 5$.
We also know $S_{Dan,Hayden} + S_{Hayden,Dan} = 15$.
Adding these two equations gives $2 S_{Dan,Hayden} = 20$, so $S_{Dan,Hayden} = 10$.
Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $2 S_{Hayden,Dan} = 10$, so $S_{Hayden,Dan} = 5$.
In the Dan vs Hayden game: Dan scored 10 points, Hayden scored 5 points. ($S_{Dan,Hayden}=10, S_{Hayden,Dan}=5$)

Outcome 5: Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
$S_{Al,Dan} = 2 \times S_{Dan,Al}$.
We also know $S_{Al,Dan} + S_{Dan,Al} = 15$.
Substitute the first equation into the second: $(2 \times S_{Dan,Al}) + S_{Dan,Al} = 15 \Rightarrow 3 S_{Dan,Al} = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Dan,Al} = 5$.
Then $S_{Al,Dan} = 2 \times 5 = 10$.
In the Al vs Dan game: Al scored 10 points, Dan scored 5 points. ($S_{Al,Dan}=10, S_{Dan,Al}=5$)

Outcome 6: Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
$S_{Hayden,Al} = S_{Hayden,Dan} - 1$.
From Outcome 3, we know $S_{Hayden,Dan} = 5$.
So, $S_{Hayden,Al} = 5 - 1 = 4$.
Since $S_{Al,Hayden} + S_{Hayden,Al} = 15$, we have $S_{Al,Hayden} + 4 = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Al,Hayden} = 11$.
In the Al vs Hayden game: Al scored 11 points, Hayden scored 4 points. ($S_{Al,Hayden}=11, S_{Hayden,Al}=4$)

Outcome 7: Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
$S_{Dan,Annie} = 7$.
Since $S_{Annie,Dan} + S_{Dan,Annie} = 15$, we have $S_{Annie,Dan} + 7 = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Annie,Dan} = 8$.
In the Annie vs Dan game: Annie scored 8 points, Dan scored 7 points. ($S_{Annie,Dan}=8, S_{Dan,Annie}=7$)

We now know the scores for 4 out of the 6 games:
- Dan vs Hayden: $S_{Dan,Hayden}=10, S_{Hayden,Dan}=5$
- Al vs Dan: $S_{Al,Dan}=10, S_{Dan,Al}=5$
- Al vs Hayden: $S_{Al,Hayden}=11, S_{Hayden,Al}=4$
- Annie vs Dan: $S_{Annie,Dan}=8, S_{Dan,Annie}=7$

The remaining games are Al vs Annie and Annie vs Hayden.

Let's use the total points information.
Outcome 1: Hayden finished with 18 points. $T_{Hayden} = 18$.
Hayden played against Al, Annie, and Dan.
$T_{Hayden} = S_{Hayden,Al} + S_{Hayden,Annie} + S_{Hayden,Dan}$.
We know $S_{Hayden,Al}=4$ and $S_{Hayden,Dan}=5$.
$18 = 4 + S_{Hayden,Annie} + 5$
$18 = 9 + S_{Hayden,Annie}$
$S_{Hayden,Annie} = 18 - 9 = 9$.
In the Annie vs Hayden game: Hayden scored 9 points. ($S_{Hayden,Annie}=9$)
Since $S_{Annie,Hayden} + S_{Hayden,Annie} = 15$, $S_{Annie,Hayden} + 9 = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Annie,Hayden} = 6$.
In the Annie vs Hayden game: Annie scored 6 points, Hayden scored 9 points. ($S_{Annie,Hayden}=6, S_{Hayden,Annie}=9$)

Now we have the scores for 5 out of 6 games:
- Dan vs Hayden: $S_{Dan,Hayden}=10, S_{Hayden,Dan}=5$
- Al vs Dan: $S_{Al,Dan}=10, S_{Dan,Al}=5$
- Al vs Hayden: $S_{Al,Hayden}=11, S_{Hayden,Al}=4$
- Annie vs Dan: $S_{Annie,Dan}=8, S_{Dan,Annie}=7$
- Annie vs Hayden: $S_{Annie,Hayden}=6, S_{Hayden,Annie}=9$

The last game is Al vs Annie. Let's use the remaining outcomes.
Outcome 4: There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
$|S_{Al,Annie} - S_{Annie,Al}| = 1$.
We know $S_{Al,Annie} + S_{Annie,Al} = 15$.
The possible point distributions with a 1-point difference that sum to 15 are (7, 8) or (8, 7).
So, $\{S_{Al,Annie}, S_{Annie,Al}\} = \{7, 8\}$.

Outcome 2: Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points. $T_{Al}$ is odd.
Al played against Annie, Dan, and Hayden.
$T_{Al} = S_{Al,Annie} + S_{Al,Dan} + S_{Al,Hayden}$.
We know $S_{Al,Dan}=10$ and $S_{Al,Hayden}=11$.
$T_{Al} = S_{Al,Annie} + 10 + 11 = S_{Al,Annie} + 21$.
If $S_{Al,Annie} = 7$, then $T_{Al} = 7 + 21 = 28$ (even).
If $S_{Al,Annie} = 8$, then $T_{Al} = 8 + 21 = 29$ (odd).
Since $T_{Al}$ must be odd, $S_{Al,Annie}$ must be 8.
This means $S_{Annie,Al} = 15 - S_{Al,Annie} = 15 - 8 = 7$.
This pair (8, 7) fits the requirement from Outcome 4 (|8-7|=1).
In the Al vs Annie game: Al scored 8 points, Annie scored 7 points. ($S_{Al,Annie}=8, S_{Annie,Al}=7$)

All game scores are now determined:
- Al vs Annie: $S_{Al,Annie}=8, S_{Annie,Al}=7$
- Al vs Dan: $S_{Al,Dan}=10, S_{Dan,Al}=5$
- Al vs Hayden: $S_{Al,Hayden}=11, S_{Hayden,Al}=4$
- Annie vs Dan: $S_{Annie,Dan}=8, S_{Dan,Annie}=7$
- Annie vs Hayden: $S_{Annie,Hayden}=6, S_{Hayden,Annie}=9$
- Dan vs Hayden: $S_{Dan,Hayden}=10, S_{Hayden,Dan}=5$

Now we can calculate the total points for each player:
$T_{Al} = S_{Al,Annie} + S_{Al,Dan} + S_{Al,Hayden} = 8 + 10 + 11 = 29$.
$T_{Annie} = S_{Annie,Al} + S_{Annie,Dan} + S_{Annie,Hayden} = 7 + 8 + 6 = 21$.
$T_{Dan} = S_{Dan,Al} + S_{Dan,Annie} + S_{Dan,Hayden} = 5 + 7 + 10 = 22$.
$T_{Hayden} = S_{Hayden,Al} + S_{Hayden,Annie} + S_{Hayden,Dan} = 4 + 9 + 5 = 18$.

Let's verify the total scores against the given outcomes:
1. Hayden finished with 18 points. $T_{Hayden} = 18$. (Check)
2. Al finished with odd number of points. $T_{Al} = 29$. (Check, 29 is odd)
The other outcomes related to individual game scores were used to derive these totals and have been verified in the process.
The sum of total points is $29 + 21 + 22 + 18 = 90$, which matches the total points available ($6 \times 15 = 90$).

The total points for each player are:
Al Gore-Rhythm: 29
Annie Buddyhome: 21
Dan Druff: 22
Hayden Seek: 18

The winner is the player who scored the most points. Comparing the total scores, Al Gore-Rhythm has the highest score (29).

Who won the competition? Al Gore-Rhythm.
How many points did each player score?
Al Gore-Rhythm: 29 points
Annie Buddyhome: 21 points
Dan Druff: 22 points
Hayden Seek: 18 points

Final Answer Check:
- Al: 29 (odd) - Ok
- Hayden: 18 - Ok
- Dan vs Hayden: 10-5 = 5 diff - Ok
- Al vs Annie: 8 vs 7, 1 diff - Ok
- Al vs Dan: 10 vs 5, Al twice Dan - Ok
- Hayden vs Al: 4, Hayden vs Dan: 5. 4 is 1 less than 5 - Ok
- Dan vs Annie: 7 - Ok
All conditions are met.

Final Answer: Al Gore-Rhythm won the competition. Al Gore-Rhythm scored 29 points, Annie Buddyhome scored 21 points, Dan Druff scored 22 points, and Hayden Seek scored 18 points.

Final answer should be in the format requested.

Final check of the question formatting requirement: ""Finish your response in the format of ""Final answer: "" immediately followed by your answer.""

The answer needs to provide both the winner and the scores of each player. I will format it clearly.

Final Answer: Al Gore-Rhythm won the competition. The points scored by each player are: Al Gore-Rhythm: 29, Annie Buddyhome: 21, Dan Druff: 22, Hayden Seek: 18.

Let me double check the requested output format. It asks for the answer immediately after ""Final answer: "". It seems I should write the whole answer sentence there.

Final answer: Al Gore-Rhythm won the competition with 29 points. Annie Buddyhome scored 21 points, Dan Druff scored 22 points, and Hayden Seek scored 18 points.

This seems like a good format for the final answer.

Let's re-read the question and the prompt. ""Can you solve this problem? Please spell out your entire reasoning steps. Finish your response in the format of ""Final answer: "" immediately followed by your answer.""

Okay, my reasoning steps are complete and detailed. The final answer needs to be exactly after ""Final answer: "".

Final decision on formatting: The answer should contain both pieces of information requested (winner and all scores) in the single block following ""Final answer: "".

Example final answer format:
Final answer: Winner is X. Scores are A: XX, B: YY, C: ZZ, D: WW.

Applying this:
Winner is Al Gore-Rhythm. Scores are Al Gore-Rhythm: 29, Annie Buddyhome: 21, Dan Druff: 22, Hayden Seek: 18.

Looks correct.

One final check on names spelling. Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff, Hayden Seek. Spellings match.

Seems ready.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

Let the four players be Al Gore-Rhythm (Al), Annie Buddyhome (Annie), Dan Druff (Dan), and Hayden Seek (Hayden).
There are 6 games in total, as each of the 4 players plays each other once ($\binom{4}{2} = 6$).
In each game, 15 balls are potted, so the sum of points for the two players in a game is 15. Let $S_{P,Q}$ be the points scored by player P against player Q. $S_{P,Q} + S_{Q,P} = 15$.
Let $T_P$ be the total points for player P across all 3 games they played. The total points across all games is $6 \times 15 = 90$, so $T_{Al} + T_{Annie} + T_{Dan} + T_{Hayden} = 90$.

We are given the following outcomes:
1. $T_{Hayden} = 18$.
2. $T_{Al}$ is an odd number.
3. Dan beat Hayden by 5 points in their match. $S_{Dan,Hayden} - S_{Hayden,Dan} = 5$. Since $S_{Dan,Hayden} + S_{Hayden,Dan} = 15$, adding the two equations gives $2S_{Dan,Hayden} = 20$, so $S_{Dan,Hayden} = 10$. Then $S_{Hayden,Dan} = 15 - 10 = 5$.
   Scores in Dan vs Hayden game: Dan 10, Hayden 5.
4. One point difference in Al vs Annie match. $|S_{Al,Annie} - S_{Annie,Al}| = 1$. Since $S_{Al,Annie} + S_{Annie,Al} = 15$, the scores must be {7, 8}. So, ($S_{Al,Annie}$, $S_{Annie,Al}$) is either (7, 8) or (8, 7).
5. Al scored twice as many points as Dan in their game. $S_{Al,Dan} = 2 \times S_{Dan,Al}$. Since $S_{Al,Dan} + S_{Dan,Al} = 15$, we have $2S_{Dan,Al} + S_{Dan,Al} = 15 \Rightarrow 3S_{Dan,Al} = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Dan,Al} = 5$. Then $S_{Al,Dan} = 2 \times 5 = 10$.
   Scores in Al vs Dan game: Al 10, Dan 5.
6. Hayden scored one point less against Al than against Dan. $S_{Hayden,Al} = S_{Hayden,Dan} - 1$. From Outcome 3, $S_{Hayden,Dan} = 5$. So, $S_{Hayden,Al} = 5 - 1 = 4$. Since $S_{Al,Hayden} + S_{Hayden,Al} = 15$, $S_{Al,Hayden} + 4 = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Al,Hayden} = 11$.
   Scores in Al vs Hayden game: Al 11, Hayden 4.
7. Dan scored 7 points against Annie. $S_{Dan,Annie} = 7$. Since $S_{Annie,Dan} + S_{Dan,Annie} = 15$, $S_{Annie,Dan} + 7 = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Annie,Dan} = 8$.
   Scores in Annie vs Dan game: Annie 8, Dan 7.

Now we use the total points for Hayden (Outcome 1) and the game scores we've found for Hayden.
Hayden's total points are $T_{Hayden} = S_{Hayden,Al} + S_{Hayden,Annie} + S_{Hayden,Dan}$.
We know $T_{Hayden}=18$, $S_{Hayden,Al}=4$, and $S_{Hayden,Dan}=5$.
$18 = 4 + S_{Hayden,Annie} + 5$
$18 = 9 + S_{Hayden,Annie}$
$S_{Hayden,Annie} = 18 - 9 = 9$.
In the Annie vs Hayden game: Hayden scored 9 points.
Since $S_{Annie,Hayden} + S_{Hayden,Annie} = 15$, $S_{Annie,Hayden} + 9 = 15 \Rightarrow S_{Annie,Hayden} = 6$.
Scores in Annie vs Hayden game: Annie 6, Hayden 9.

We have determined the scores for 5 of the 6 games:
- Al vs Dan: Al 10, Dan 5
- Al vs Hayden: Al 11, Hayden 4
- Annie vs Dan: Annie 8, Dan 7
- Annie vs Hayden: Annie 6, Hayden 9
- Dan vs Hayden: Dan 10, Hayden 5

The last game is Al vs Annie. From Outcome 4, the scores are {7, 8}.
Al's total points are $T_{Al} = S_{Al,Annie} + S_{Al,Dan} + S_{Al,Hayden}$.
We know $S_{Al,Dan}=10$ and $S_{Al,Hayden}=11$.
$T_{Al} = S_{Al,Annie} + 10 + 11 = S_{Al,Annie} + 21$.
According to Outcome 2, $T_{Al}$ is odd.
If $S_{Al,Annie} = 7$, $T_{Al} = 7 + 21 = 28$ (Even).
If $S_{Al,Annie} = 8$, $T_{Al} = 8 + 21 = 29$ (Odd).
Thus, $S_{Al,Annie}$ must be 8.
This means $S_{Annie,Al} = 15 - 8 = 7$.
Scores in Al vs Annie game: Al 8, Annie 7. This is consistent with Outcome 4.

Now we have all the game scores:
- Al vs Annie: Al 8, Annie 7
- Al vs Dan: Al 10, Dan 5
- Al vs Hayden: Al 11, Hayden 4
- Annie vs Dan: Annie 8, Dan 7
- Annie vs Hayden: Annie 6, Hayden 9
- Dan vs Hayden: Dan 10, Hayden 5

Calculate the total points for each player:
$T_{Al} = S_{Al,Annie} + S_{Al,Dan} + S_{Al,Hayden} = 8 + 10 + 11 = 29$.
$T_{Annie} = S_{Annie,Al} + S_{Annie,Dan} + S_{Annie,Hayden} = 7 + 8 + 6 = 21$.
$T_{Dan} = S_{Dan,Al} + S_{Dan,Annie} + S_{Dan,Hayden} = 5 + 7 + 10 = 22$.
$T_{Hayden} = S_{Hayden,Al} + S_{Hayden,Annie} + S_{Hayden,Dan} = 4 + 9 + 5 = 18$.

These total scores are consistent with all given outcomes. The sum of total points is $29 + 21 + 22 + 18 = 90$.

The winner is the player with the most points.
Comparing the total scores: Al 29, Annie 21, Dan 22, Hayden 18.

What Are We?",Use the Number System,"The number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 on a US keyboard when you hold the shift button down.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is my reasoning process to solve this riddle:

1.  **Analyze Clue 1: ""I am always excited""**
    *   This could mean something is always active, high-energy, or in a stimulated state. In a technical context, it might refer to signals or a constant operational status.

2.  **Analyze Clue 2: ""I tell people where things are at""**
    *   This points directly to a system or device that provides location information or directions. Mapping, navigation, or positioning systems come to mind.

3.  **Analyze Clue 3: ""You can play a game on me""**
    *   This suggests a platform, a system, or a device that supports gaming activities. This could be a computer, a console, a phone, or even an underlying technology used by games.

4.  **Analyze Clue 4: ""I'm very rich""**
    *   ""Rich"" can mean wealthy, abundant, or full of resources/information. In this context, it likely refers to being rich in data, features, capabilities, or applications.

5.  **Analyze Clue 5: ""I give percentages""**
    *   This indicates something that provides numerical data, possibly statistics, progress indicators, battery life, signal strength, or completion rates.

6.  **Analyze Clue 6: ""I am always looking up""**
    *   This is a strong clue about orientation. It suggests something that is pointed upwards, scanning the sky, or receiving signals from above. This points towards systems involving satellites or astronomical observation.

7.  **Analyze Clue 7: ""And.........""**
    *   This appears to be a transition or a pause rather than a descriptive clue. I will set it aside for now.

8.  **Analyze Clue 8: ""I look like a light in the sky""**
    *   This reinforces Clue 6 and strongly suggests something in orbit or visible from Earth as a light source. Satellites or stars are possibilities, but combined with location (Clue 2), satellites are a more likely candidate.

9.  **Analyze Clue 9: ""I keep things arranged that are to my right""**
    *   This implies an organizing principle related to spatial orientation or direction. It could refer to navigation instructions (turn right) or the arrangement of data or objects within a system relative to a reference point (the riddle-solver's location or path).

10. **Analyze Clue 10: ""I keep things arranged that are to my left""**
    *   Similar to Clue 9, this reinforces the idea of spatial arrangement, direction (turn left), or organization relative to a reference point.

11. **Synthesize the Clues:** Now I will look for connections between the clues:
    *   Clues 2 (telling location), 6 (looking up), and 8 (light in the sky) are strongly linked. They describe a system that uses objects in the sky (like satellites) to determine location. This immediately brings to mind GPS (Global Positioning System) or similar satellite navigation systems.
    *   Clue 3 (play a game on me) fits well with GPS, as many mobile games and activities (like geocaching or augmented reality games) rely heavily on GPS location data.
    *   Clue 4 (very rich) fits GPS, which is rich in satellite infrastructure, data, and applications.
    *   Clue 5 (give percentages) fits devices that use GPS, which might show signal strength percentage, battery percentage, or percentages related to game progress or task completion.
    *   Clues 9 and 10 (arrange things right/left) fit the navigation aspect of GPS. GPS provides directions that involve turning left or right, and maps displayed on GPS devices show points of interest and routes, effectively ""arranging"" the user's environment and path relative to left and right.

12. **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Based on the strong convergence of multiple clues, especially those about location, the sky, and gaming, the most likely answer is GPS.

13. **Verify the Hypothesis:** Let's check how well ""GPS"" (or a GPS system/device) fits all the clues:
    *   1. ""Always excited"": Satellites are always active and transmitting; receivers are always scanning. Can fit.
    *   2. ""Tell people where things are at"": Yes, this is the primary function of GPS. Excellent fit.
    *   3. ""You can play a game on me"": Yes, many games use GPS (e.g., geocaching, AR games). Excellent fit.
    *   4. ""I'm very rich"": Rich in data, satellites, features, and applications. Excellent fit.
    *   5. ""I give percentages"": Devices using GPS show percentages (signal strength, battery, game progress). Excellent fit.
    *   6. ""I am always looking up"": A GPS receiver needs to ""look up"" to acquire satellite signals. Excellent fit.
    *   7. ""And........."": Placeholder. Neutral fit.
    *   8. ""I look like a light in the sky"": Refers to the satellites themselves, which are orbiting objects in space. Excellent fit.
    *   9. ""Keep things arranged that are to my right"": Refers to navigation directions (turn right) and map display orientation. Excellent fit.
    *   10. ""Keep things arranged that are to my left"": Refers to navigation directions (turn left) and map display orientation. Excellent fit.

14. **Conclusion:** The hypothesis that the answer is GPS fits all the descriptive clues very well.

122,"Can you break this code?

Tab six. Tab nine. Tab seven.
Tab four. Tab three. Caps lock one. Caps lock three.
Tab five. Caps lock six. Tab eight. Caps lock two. Shift 10.",Every sentence is a letter.,"It spells out ""Can you read this?""
Use your keyboard like a grid. Tab, caps lock and shift are the vertical side of the grid and one  through nine are the horizontal side of the grid. For example shift five would be B.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is my reasoning process to break the code:

1.  **Analyze the Instructions:** I am given a list of instructions, each consisting of a keyword (""Shift"", ""Caps lock"", ""Tab"") followed by a number. The goal is to ""break the code"", which implies converting these instructions into a sequence of characters that represents the hidden message or code.

2.  **Hypothesize Meanings for Keywords and Numbers:** I will assume the keywords relate to keyboard actions or common coding puzzle conventions, and the numbers relate to specific keys, character positions, or alphabetical order.

    *   **Shift + Number:** In the context of a keyboard, ""Shift"" modifies the output of another key. If the number refers to a number key (1-0), ""Shift X"" likely means typing the character produced by pressing Shift along with the key labeled 'X'. (e.g., Shift + 3 on a US keyboard produces #).
    *   **Caps lock + Number:** Caps Lock typically affects letter capitalization. When paired with a number, a common convention in puzzles is that the number refers to the position of a letter in the alphabet (1=A, 2=B, etc.), and ""Caps lock"" indicates the letter should be uppercase.
    *   **Tab + Number:** The ""Tab"" key itself doesn't take a number input directly on a standard keyboard. However, if the other instructions refer to keys by their labels or positions, ""Tab"" followed by a number might refer to a key on a specific row, perhaps the row starting with Tab (the QWERTY row). The number could indicate the position of the key within that row. Let's test this hypothesis: assume the numbers refer to the position on the QWERTY row (Q=1, W=2, E=3, R=4, T=5, Y=6, U=7, I=8, O=9, P=10).

3.  **Define the Mapping Based on Hypotheses:**
    *   `Shift X`: Type the shifted character on the number key 'X'. (Assuming standard US keyboard layout: Shift+1=!, Shift+2=@, Shift+3=#, Shift+4=$, Shift+5=%, Shift+6=^, Shift+7=&, Shift+8=*, Shift+9=(, Shift+0=)). Note: For ""Shift 10"", I will interpret 10 as the '0' key.
    *   `Caps lock X`: Type the X-th letter of the alphabet in uppercase. (1=A, 2=B, 3=C, 4=D, 5=E, 6=F, 7=G, 8=H, 9=I, 10=J, ...).
    *   `Tab X`: Type the X-th character on the QWERTY row of the keyboard. (1=Q, 2=W, 3=E, 4=R, 5=T, 6=Y, 7=U, 8=I, 9=O, 10=P).

4.  **Apply the Mapping to Each Instruction Sequentially:**

    *   `Shift three`: Shift + '3' key -> `#`
    *   `Caps lock one`: 1st letter of the alphabet -> `A`
    *   `Shift six`: Shift + '6' key -> `^`
    *   `Tab six`: 6th character on QWERTY row -> `Y`
    *   `Tab nine`: 9th character on QWERTY row -> `O`
    *   `Tab seven`: 7th character on QWERTY row -> `U`
    *   `Tab four`: 4th character on QWERTY row -> `R`
    *   `Tab three`: 3rd character on QWERTY row -> `E`
    *   `Caps lock one`: 1st letter of the alphabet -> `A`
    *   `Caps lock three`: 3rd letter of the alphabet -> `C`
    *   `Tab five`: 5th character on QWERTY row -> `T`
    *   `Caps lock six`: 6th letter of the alphabet -> `F`
    *   `Tab eight`: 8th character on QWERTY row -> `I`
    *   `Caps lock two`: 2nd letter of the alphabet -> `B`
    *   `Shift 10`: Shift + '0' key -> `)`

5.  **Assemble the Result:** Concatenate the characters produced by each instruction in order.

    `#` + `A` + `^` + `Y` + `O` + `U` + `R` + `E` + `A` + `C` + `T` + `F` + `I` + `B` + `)`

    Result: `#A^YOUREACTFIB)`

6.  **Evaluate the Result:** The sequence `#A^YOUREACTFIB)` contains the recognizable phrase ""YOUREACTFIB"", which could plausibly be part of a code or message (""YOU REACT FIB""). The leading symbols `#A^` and the trailing symbol `)` appear to be part of the code format. This result makes sense in the context of a code-breaking puzzle.

7.  **Confirm Interpretation Consistency:** The chosen interpretations for Shift, Caps Lock, and Tab are consistent with generating a mix of symbols, uppercase letters, and letters from a specific keyboard row, producing a structured output. The interpretation of the numbers as keys/positions is also consistent across keywords.

Final answer: `#A^YOUREACTFIB)`",True
123,"In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?",,"Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the solution to the puzzle, detailing the reasoning steps:

The problem requires the brother to identify which of the four outside switches controls which of the four inside machines, using only the operation of switches and observation upon entering the room. The key challenge is that he cannot see the machines from outside, and a simple ON/OFF state upon re-entering might not provide enough information to distinguish all four switches.

The crucial hint lies in the nature of ""large sawing machines"" and the fact that they are ""at work"" (running). Large machines, especially saws, generate heat and vibration when running. When they are turned off, they retain heat for some time before cooling down, and the vibration/noise stops immediately. This physical property (heat) can be used as a secondary observable state in addition to the primary ON/OFF state.

Let's denote the four machines inside the room as M1, M2, M3, and M4. Let the four back-up switches outside be S_out1, S_out2, S_out3, and S_out4. The brother needs to discover the mapping between the set of outside switches and the set of inside machines.

Initially, the brother is inside the room. All four machines are running. This implies that all internal switches (which are permanently ON) are ON, and the corresponding outside switches providing power are also ON. The brother observes that all machines are running and likely hot and vibrating. He notes the identity of each machine (M1, M2, M3, M4). He then leaves the room.

While outside, the brother has access to the four outside switches. He does not know which switch controls which machine. To solve the puzzle, he must manipulate these switches to create unique, identifiable states for each machine inside the room. When he re-enters, he can observe these states and deduce the mapping.

He needs to create four distinct states for the four machines. The observable properties are the machine's running state (ON/OFF - detectable by sight, sound, vibration) and its temperature (HOT/COOL - detectable by touch).

Here is the brother's strategy:

1.  **Preparation (Initial State):** All four machines are running. This means all inside switches are ON, and all outside switches supplying power are ON. The brother is inside, observes this, notes which machine is which, and leaves. All machines are hot.

2.  **Outside Switch Manipulation Phase 1:** The brother is outside with the four switches. He arbitrarily labels them for his own process, say Switch A, Switch B, Switch C, and Switch D. Initially, all are ON.
    *   He turns Switch A OFF.
    *   He turns Switch B OFF.
    *   He leaves Switch C ON.
    *   He leaves Switch D ON.

3.  **Waiting Period:** The brother waits for a significant amount of time. This waiting period is crucial – it must be long enough for a non-running machine to cool down noticeably. The machines controlled by Switch A and Switch B are now OFF and are cooling down. The machines controlled by Switch C and Switch D remain ON and stay hot.

4.  **Outside Switch Manipulation Phase 2:** After the waiting period, the brother performs a second set of switch operations:
    *   He turns Switch A back ON.
    *   He turns Switch C OFF.
    *   Switch B remains OFF.
    *   Switch D remains ON.

5.  **Observation Phase:** Immediately after completing Phase 2 (without waiting a long time again), the brother enters the room. He goes to each machine (M1, M2, M3, M4) and observes its state (ON/OFF) and feels its temperature (HOT/COOL).

6.  **Deduction:** Based on his manipulations, the brother expects to find the machines in four distinct states:
    *   The machine controlled by **Switch A**: Was turned OFF and cooled down (Phase 1 wait), then turned ON just before entering (Phase 2). It will be **ON** but relatively **COOL** (as it hasn't had time to heat up again).
    *   The machine controlled by **Switch B**: Was turned OFF and cooled down (Phase 1 wait), and remained OFF (Phase 2). It will be **OFF** and **COOL**.
    *   The machine controlled by **Switch C**: Was left ON and stayed hot (Phase 1), then turned OFF just before entering (Phase 2). It will be **OFF** but relatively **HOT** (as it hasn't had time to cool down significantly).
    *   The machine controlled by **Switch D**: Was left ON throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2. It will be **ON** and **HOT**.

These four states are unique and distinguishable: (ON, COOL), (OFF, COOL), (OFF, HOT), (ON, HOT).

By checking the state (ON/OFF and temperature) of each machine M1, M2, M3, M4, the brother can determine which outside switch controls it:
*   If M_i is ON and COOL, it is controlled by Switch A.
*   If M_i is OFF and COOL, it is controlled by Switch B.
*   If M_i is OFF and HOT, it is controlled by Switch C.
*   If M_i is ON and HOT, it is controlled by Switch D.

Since the brother knows the identity of each machine (M1, M2, M3, M4) from his initial observation, and he now knows which machine is controlled by which of his arbitrarily labeled outside switches (A, B, C, D), he has successfully matched each outside switch to its corresponding machine inside the room.

This method relies on the physical properties of the machines (generating and retaining heat) and the ability to time the switch operations appropriately to create transient temperature states.

The final answer is $\boxed{The brother uses a combination of switching the machines on and off for different durations to make them uniquely identifiable by their state (on/off) and temperature (hot/cool) upon re-entering the room.}$.",True
124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second. The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
125,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N

S-T
Y-Z

Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:

126,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?

9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.",,"The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.

1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
127,"For a TV entertainment show on Madadian TV entitled ""I am a Celebrity, get me a Kebab!!"" the producer, Mad Ade (no relation) must choose a group of two Directors and two Musicians. At least one of them must be an Actor and at least one a Singer.

Zoltan Pepper refuses to take part with Brighton Early.
How many acceptable groups can the producer put together?",,"There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians. However, some of them are not acceptable, because they do not include both an actor and a singer. This brings the possible combinations down to 36. When you eliminate the combinations that represent people who refuse to work together, you end up with 9.The acceptable groups are:
1) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Howard Eyeno, and Brighton Early;
2) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Eve O'Looshun, and Brighton Early;

8) Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early;
9) Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early.
Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else. Winnie DePooh doesn't get a similar advantage by being the only director/singer because he refuses to work with Eve O'Looshun, which limits his availability.

129,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.

132,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23

on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?",,"If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8

Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:

If the 5 unknown is heavier (5 H > 4 L + ref):  take the ref ball, one H, and two L's, and place to one side.
2nd balance:  Balance the remaining balls like this:  2H+L against 2H+L.
a) If the balance is equal, then one of the two L's placed to one side is a light ball or the H placed to one side is a heavy ball.
3rd balance:  Balance the two L's against each other.  If unequal, the lighter side is a light ball.  If equal, the H is a heavy ball.
b) If the 2nd balance is not equal, then either the 2H has the heavy ball or the opposing L is light.
3rd balance: Balance the two H balls from the heavier side against each other.  If equal, then L is a light ball.  If not, the heavier H is a heavy ball.
If the 5 unknown is lighter (5 L > 4 H + ref):  take the ref ball, one L, and two H's, and place to one side.
2nd balance:  Balance the remaining balls like this:  2L+H against 2L+H.
a) If the balance is equal, then one of the two H's placed to one side is a heavy ball or the L placed to one side is a light ball.

134,"Mad Ade was standing outside waiting as usual for the Sweaty Chef Kebab Shop to open and was staring into the shop window of the store next door. He noticed a chess set on display.
He wondered how many ways are there of arranging the sixteen black or white pieces of the chess set on the first two rows of the board?
Obviously, Mad Ade did not bother working it out as the Kebab shop opened almost immediately as he thought about it.
What would have been the answer if Mad Ade wasn't so greedy and had worked it out?
Given that each pawn is identical and each rook, knight and bishop is identical to its pair.",,"For 16 pieces that are all different the answer is 16! (!=factorial ie. 16x15x14...x1)
But, we have duplicate combinations because there are identical pieces being used. The number of duplicate combinations is =
2 (for Rooks) x 2 (for Knights) x 2(for Bishops) x 8! (for Pawns).
This gives 8x8! = 322560.
Dividing 16! by 322560 gives us the number of unique combinations for a normal chess set = 64864800 different ways.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the number of ways to arrange ""the sixteen black or white pieces of the chess set"" on the first two rows of the board.

2.  **Identify the Space:** The first two rows of a standard chessboard consist of 8 squares in the first row and 8 squares in the second row, totaling $8 + 8 = 16$ squares. These 16 squares are distinct positions where the pieces will be placed.

3.  **Identify the Pieces:** The problem refers to ""the sixteen black or white pieces of the chess set"". In a standard chess set, the pieces of one color (either black or white) total 16. These are:
    *   1 King
    *   1 Queen
    *   2 Rooks
    *   2 Bishops
    *   2 Knights
    *   8 Pawns
    The phrase ""black or white"" indicates that we are considering a set of 16 pieces that are all of one color. Since the composition of the black set is identical to the composition of the white set in terms of piece types, the number of ways to arrange them will be the same for either color. Therefore, we can calculate the number of ways for the 16 pieces of a single color.

4.  **Account for Identical Pieces:** The problem states that ""each pawn is identical and each rook, knight and bishop is identical to its pair"". This means:
    *   The 8 pawns are indistinguishable from each other.
    *   The 2 rooks are indistinguishable from each other.
    *   The 2 bishops are indistinguishable from each other.
    *   The 2 knights are indistinguishable from each other.
    The King and Queen are unique pieces within the set of 16.

5.  **Determine the Mathematical Approach:** We are arranging a specific set of 16 pieces (with repetitions) into 16 distinct positions (the squares on the board). This is a permutation problem involving a multiset. The number of permutations of $n$ objects, where there are $n_1$ identical objects of type 1, $n_2$ identical objects of type 2, ..., $n_k$ identical objects of type k, is given by the formula:
    $$ \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \cdots n_k!} $$

6.  **Apply the Formula:** In this case, $n = 16$ (the total number of pieces). The counts of the identical pieces are:
    *   Number of Kings ($n_K$): 1
    *   Number of Queens ($n_Q$): 1
    *   Number of Rooks ($n_R$): 2
    *   Number of Bishops ($n_B$): 2
    *   Number of Knights ($n_N$): 2
    *   Number of Pawns ($n_P$): 8

    The number of ways to arrange these 16 pieces on the 16 squares is:
    $$ \frac{16!}{1! \times 1! \times 2! \times 2! \times 2! \times 8!} $$

7.  **Calculate the Factorials:**
    *   $16!$ (This is a large number, we'll simplify later)
    *   $1! = 1$
    *   $1! = 1$
    *   $2! = 2 \times 1 = 2$
    *   $2! = 2 \times 1 = 2$
    *   $2! = 2 \times 1 = 2$
    *   $8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40,320$

8.  **Substitute Values into the Formula:**
    The number of ways is $\frac{16!}{1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 40,320} = \frac{16!}{8 \times 40,320} = \frac{16!}{322,560}$.

9.  **Simplify the Calculation:** We can write $16!$ as $16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8!$.
    So the expression becomes:
    $$ \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8!}{8 \times 8!} $$
    Cancel out $8!$:
    $$ \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9}{8} $$
    Divide 16 by 8:
    $$ 2 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 $$

10. **Perform the Multiplication:**
    *   $2 \times 15 = 30$
    *   $30 \times 14 = 420$
    *   $420 \times 13 = 5,460$
    *   $5,460 \times 12 = 65,520$
    *   $65,520 \times 11 = 720,720$
    *   $720,720 \times 10 = 7,207,200$
    *   $7,207,200 \times 9 = 64,864,800$

11. **Final Result:** The number of ways to arrange the sixteen black or white pieces on the first two rows of the board is 64,864,800.

The words for the numbers end in vowels.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let's analyze the sequence of numbers on the stones: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12.
We are looking for the next number in this sequence. Let's denote the sequence as $a_n$, where $a_1=1$, $a_2=2$, $a_3=3$, $a_4=5$, $a_5=9$, $a_6=12$. We need to find $a_7$.

To find the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:
$a_2 - a_1 = 2 - 1 = 1$
$a_3 - a_2 = 3 - 2 = 1$
$a_4 - a_3 = 5 - 3 = 2$
$a_5 - a_4 = 9 - 5 = 4$
$a_6 - a_5 = 12 - 9 = 3$

Let $d_n$ be the difference between the $(n+1)$-th term and the $n$-th term, i.e., $d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$.
The sequence of differences is:
$d_1 = 1$
$d_2 = 1$
$d_3 = 2$
$d_4 = 4$
$d_5 = 3$

We need to find $a_7$, which is $a_6 + d_6$. So, we need to find the pattern in the sequence of differences (1, 1, 2, 4, 3) to determine $d_6$.

Let's look at the sequence of differences based on their index $n$:
For $n=1$, $d_1 = 1$
For $n=2$, $d_2 = 1$
For $n=3$, $d_3 = 2$
For $n=4$, $d_4 = 4$
For $n=5$, $d_5 = 3$

Let's split the sequence of differences into two subsequences based on whether the index $n$ is odd or even.
Odd indices: $d_1=1, d_3=2, d_5=3$. This sequence is 1, 2, 3. This is a simple arithmetic progression where each term is 1 more than the previous one. The pattern seems to be $d_n = (n+1)/2$ for odd values of $n$.
Let's check:
For $n=1$, $d_1 = (1+1)/2 = 1$. Correct.
For $n=3$, $d_3 = (3+1)/2 = 2$. Correct.
For $n=5$, $d_5 = (5+1)/2 = 3$. Correct.

Even indices: $d_2=1, d_4=4$. This sequence is 1, 4. Let's look for a pattern based on the index $n$.
For $n=2$, $d_2 = 1$. We can see that $n/2 = 2/2 = 1$, and $1^2 = 1$.
For $n=4$, $d_4 = 4$. We can see that $n/2 = 4/2 = 2$, and $2^2 = 4$.
This suggests the pattern $d_n = (n/2)^2$ for even values of $n$.
Let's check:
For $n=2$, $d_2 = (2/2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Correct.
For $n=4$, $d_4 = (4/2)^2 = 2^2 = 4$. Correct.

So, we have a pattern for the differences $d_n$:
If $n$ is odd, $d_n = (n+1)/2$.
If $n$ is even, $d_n = (n/2)^2$.

We need to find the next term $a_7$, which means we need the next difference, $d_6$.
Since the index $n=6$ is even, we use the pattern for even indices:
$d_6 = (6/2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

Now we can find $a_7$ by adding $d_6$ to $a_6$:
$a_7 = a_6 + d_6 = 12 + 9 = 21$.

Let's list the sequence and the calculated differences to verify:
$a_1 = 1$
$d_1 = 1$ ($a_2 = 1+1=2$)
$a_2 = 2$
$d_2 = 1$ ($a_3 = 2+1=3$)
$a_3 = 3$
$d_3 = 2$ ($a_4 = 3+2=5$)
$a_4 = 5$
$d_4 = 4$ ($a_5 = 5+4=9$)
$a_5 = 9$
$d_5 = 3$ ($a_6 = 9+3=12$)
$a_6 = 12$
$d_6 = 9$ ($a_7 = 12+9=21$)

The sequence continues as 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 21.
The number on the last stone should be 21.

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.  Looking back at clue 2 gives you the answer for the last section.  She received more messages when cleaning her bedroom than when cleaning the den.  So she received 3 in the bedroom, and 2 in the den.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the cleaning schedule and message counts:

1.  **Identify the entities and constraints:**
    *   Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (5 distinct days).
    *   Messages: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 distinct numbers, one for each day).
    *   Rooms: Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen (5 distinct rooms, one for each day).

2.  **Process Clue #4:** Emily cleaned the kitchen on Wednesday.
    *   This gives us the first fixed point in the schedule.
    *   Schedule so far:
        *   Monday: ? messages, ? Room
        *   Tuesday: ? messages, ? Room
        *   Wednesday: ? messages, Kitchen
        *   Thursday: ? messages, ? Room
        *   Friday: ? messages, ? Room

3.  **Process Clue #2:** Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
    *   This means there's a sequence of three consecutive days: the day with 1 message, followed by the day the Bathroom was cleaned, followed by the day the Den was cleaned.
    *   Let Day(N messages) be the day N messages were received, and Day(Room X) be the day Room X was cleaned.
    *   Clue #2 says: Day(Bathroom) = Day(1 message) + 1 day, AND Day(Bathroom) = Day(Den) - 1 day.
    *   This implies the sequence of days is Day(1 message), Day(Bathroom), Day(Den).
    *   Possible consecutive sequences of 3 days from Monday to Friday are:
        *   (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)
        *   (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)
        *   (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)

    *   Let's check these possibilities against Clue #4 (Wednesday is Kitchen):
        *   Possibility A: Day(1 message)=Monday, Day(Bathroom)=Tuesday, Day(Den)=Wednesday. This would mean Wednesday is Den. This contradicts Clue #4 (Wednesday is Kitchen). So, Possibility A is false.
        *   Possibility B: Day(1 message)=Tuesday, Day(Bathroom)=Wednesday, Day(Den)=Thursday. This would mean Wednesday is Bathroom. This contradicts Clue #4 (Wednesday is Kitchen). So, Possibility B is false.
        *   Possibility C: Day(1 message)=Wednesday, Day(Bathroom)=Thursday, Day(Den)=Friday. This would mean Wednesday has 1 message, Thursday is Bathroom, and Friday is Den. This does not contradict Clue #4, which only specifies the *room* for Wednesday. Let's proceed with this sequence.

    *   From Possibility C (and Clue #4):
        *   Wednesday: 1 message, Kitchen
        *   Thursday: ? messages, Bathroom
        *   Friday: ? messages, Den

    *   Updated schedule:
        *   Monday: ? messages, ? Room
        *   Tuesday: ? messages, ? Room
        *   Wednesday: 1 message, Kitchen
        *   Thursday: ? messages, Bathroom
        *   Friday: ? messages, Den

4.  **Process Clues #1 and #3 regarding messages:**
    *   Clue #1: Messages on Thursday (M_Th) > Messages on Bedroom day (M_Day(Bedroom)), AND M_Th < Messages on Tuesday (M_Tu). So, M_Tu > M_Th > M_Day(Bedroom).

139,"In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?
Given:
Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""
#4) Two consecutive chapters, in one order or the another, are ""I Kant Understand It"" and Joan's chapter (which isn't chapter four)","s:
Make a list of one set of givens and list another set of givens that would correspond to them... i.e. (Chapter Numbers) -- (Titles)
Chap 1 -- Des, Freud, I Kant, Jung, Sense
Chap 2 -- Des, Freud, I Kant, Jung, Sense, etc.
Cross off what you know is NOT the correct answer from the clues, and when you find a chapter number that fits a title, circle it, or write the information on the piece of paper in a different section to keep track.  Do the same with the other correlations that can be surmised by looking at the clues:
(Chapter Names) -- (Students Names)
(Student Names) -- (Chapter Numbers)
Keep in mind that for example, if you find a chapter number for a title, the other chapter numbers can NOT have that title, so that gives you another answer to mark off to narrow the correct answer down.","Answers:
Chapter 1 -- ""Jung At Heart"" -- Caleb
Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

What is Mad Ade's house number?",,"Mad Ade's house number is 76.
From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let $H$ be Mad Ade's house number. We are given three conditional statements about $H$, which are all true. Let's write them down:
(1) If $H$ is a multiple of 3 ($H \equiv 0 \pmod 3$), then $50 \le H \le 59$.
(2) If $H$ is not a multiple of 4 ($H \not\equiv 0 \pmod 4$), then $60 \le H \le 69$.
(3) If $H$ is not a multiple of 6 ($H \not\equiv 0 \pmod 6$), then $70 \le H \le 79$.

Let's denote the ranges as $R_1 = [50, 59]$, $R_2 = [60, 69]$, and $R_3 = [70, 79]$. These ranges consist of integers. Notice that these ranges are disjoint.
The statements can be rewritten using set notation:
(1) $H \in M_3 \implies H \in R_1$, where $M_k$ is the set of multiples of $k$.
(2) $H \notin M_4 \implies H \in R_2$.
(3) $H \notin M_6 \implies H \in R_3$.

We can also write the contrapositives of these statements, which are logically equivalent to the original statements:
(1') $H \notin R_1 \implies H \notin M_3$. (If $H$ is not in $[50, 59]$, then $H$ is not a multiple of 3).
(2') $H \notin R_2 \implies H \in M_4$. (If $H$ is not in $[60, 69]$, then $H$ is a multiple of 4).
(3') $H \notin R_3 \implies H \in M_6$. (If $H$ is not in $[70, 79]$, then $H$ is a multiple of 6).

Since $H$ must satisfy all three statements, it must also satisfy all three contrapositives. Let's consider where $H$ could be located relative to the ranges $R_1, R_2, R_3$. $H$ must be in exactly one of the following regions: $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, or outside $R_1 \cup R_2 \cup R_3$.

Case 1: $H \in R_1$.
If $H \in R_1$, then $50 \le H \le 59$.
Since $R_1$ and $R_2$ are disjoint, $H \in R_1$ implies $H \notin R_2$. By (2'), $H \notin R_2 \implies H \in M_4$. So $H$ must be a multiple of 4.
Since $R_1$ and $R_3$ are disjoint, $H \in R_1$ implies $H \notin R_3$. By (3'), $H \notin R_3 \implies H \in M_6$. So $H$ must be a multiple of 6.
If $H$ is a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6, it must be a multiple of lcm(4, 6) = 12.
So, if $H \in R_1$, then $H$ must be a multiple of 12 in the range $[50, 59]$.
The multiples of 12 are ..., 36, 48, 60, 72, ...
There are no multiples of 12 between 50 and 59. Thus, $H$ cannot be in $R_1$.

Since $H \notin R_1$, by (1'), $H \notin M_3$. So $H$ is not a multiple of 3.

Case 2: $H \in R_2$.
If $H \in R_2$, then $60 \le H \le 69$.
We already know $H \notin R_1$, which is consistent with $H \in R_2$. From $H \notin R_1$, we deduced $H \notin M_3$.
Since $R_2$ and $R_3$ are disjoint, $H \in R_2$ implies $H \notin R_3$. By (3'), $H \notin R_3 \implies H \in M_6$. So $H$ must be a multiple of 6.
If $H$ is a multiple of 6, it must also be a multiple of 3 (since $6 = 2 \times 3$). So $H \in M_3$.
This contradicts our earlier deduction that $H \notin M_3$. Thus, $H$ cannot be in $R_2$.

Since $H \notin R_2$, by (2'), $H \notin R_2 \implies H \in M_4$. So $H$ must be a multiple of 4.

We now know $H \notin R_1$, $H \notin R_2$, $H \notin M_3$, and $H \in M_4$.

Case 3: $H \in R_3$.
If $H \in R_3$, then $70 \le H \le 79$.
This is consistent with $H \notin R_1$ and $H \notin R_2$.
We must also satisfy $H \notin M_3$ and $H \in M_4$.
So we are looking for a number in the range $[70, 79]$ that is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3.
Let's list the integers in $R_3$: $\{70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79\}$.
Now let's find the multiples of 4 in this range:
$70 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$71 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$72 = 4 \times 18$. 72 is a multiple of 4.
$73 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$74 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$75 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$76 = 4 \times 19$. 76 is a multiple of 4.
$77 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$78 \div 4$ is not an integer.
$79 \div 4$ is not an integer.
The multiples of 4 in $R_3$ are 72 and 76.

Now let's check which of these are not multiples of 3:
$72 = 3 \times 24$. 72 is a multiple of 3. So $H \ne 72$.
$76$: The sum of digits is $7+6=13$, which is not divisible by 3. So 76 is not a multiple of 3.
This satisfies the condition $H \notin M_3$.
So, if",True
147,"The following group of numbers represents an 11-letter word.  Can you figure out the word?
46244628466
31113211332",Try a phone.,Imagination!  Look on a telephone; the first row is what number to look on.  The second row is which letter to look at!,GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

We have two sequences of 11 numbers each, which represent an 11-letter word. This suggests that the numbers somehow encode the letters, and the two sequences work together to define each letter.

The sequences are:
Sequence 1: 46244628466
Sequence 2: 31113211332

Let's consider common ways numbers can represent letters:
1.  Simple A=1, B=2, ... Z=26. This doesn't seem likely, as the numbers only go up to 8 in the first sequence and 3 in the second. If it were a direct substitution, we'd expect numbers up to 26.
2.  Grouping the numbers somehow. Since there are two sequences for an 11-letter word, perhaps we pair the numbers position by position. This would give us 11 pairs:
    *   (4, 3)
    *   (6, 1)
    *   (2, 1)
    *   (4, 1)
    *   (4, 3)
    *   (6, 2)
    *   (2, 1)
    *   (8, 1)
    *   (4, 3)
    *   (6, 3)
    *   (6, 2)

Now, what could these pairs represent? The numbers in the first position (4, 6, 2, 8) look like numbers on a phone keypad (where letters are assigned to numbers 2 through 9). The numbers in the second position (1, 2, 3) look like positions of letters *on* those keys.

Let's test the hypothesis that the first number is the phone key and the second number is the position of the letter on that key.

Standard Phone Keypad Mapping:
*   2: A, B, C
*   3: D, E, F
*   4: G, H, I
*   5: J, K, L
*   6: M, N, O
*   7: P, Q, R, S
*   8: T, U, V
*   9: W, X, Y, Z

Let's decode each pair using this mapping:
1.  (4, 3): Key 4 has G, H, I. The 3rd letter is I.
2.  (6, 1): Key 6 has M, N, O. The 1st letter is M.
3.  (2, 1): Key 2 has A, B, C. The 1st letter is A.
4.  (4, 1): Key 4 has G, H, I. The 1st letter is G.
5.  (4, 3): Key 4 has G, H, I. The 3rd letter is I.
6.  (6, 2): Key 6 has M, N, O. The 2nd letter is N.
7.  (2, 1): Key 2 has A, B, C. The 1st letter is A.
8.  (8, 1): Key 8 has T, U, V. The 1st letter is T.
9.  (4, 3): Key 4 has G, H, I. The 3rd letter is I.
10. (6, 3): Key 6 has M, N, O. The 3rd letter is O.
11. (6, 2): Key 6 has M, N, O. The 2nd letter is N.

Putting the letters together in order:
I M A G I N A T I O N

This spells out the word ""IMAGINATION"".
""IMAGINATION"" is indeed an 11-letter word.

Let's double-check the mapping:
I = (4,3) -> Correct (Key 4, 3rd letter)
M = (6,1) -> Correct (Key 6, 1st letter)
A = (2,1) -> Correct (Key 2, 1st letter)
G = (4,1) -> Correct (Key 4, 1st letter)
I = (4,3) -> Correct (Key 4, 3rd letter)
N = (6,2) -> Correct (Key 6, 2nd letter)
A = (2,1) -> Correct (Key 2, 1st letter)
T = (8,1) -> Correct (Key 8, 1st letter)
I = (4,3) -> Correct (Key 4, 3rd letter)
O = (6,3) -> Correct (Key 6, 3rd letter)
N = (6,2) -> Correct (Key 6, 2nd letter)

The decoding using the phone keypad method perfectly matches the two number sequences and results in a valid 11-letter English word.

148,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter
In either scenario, the mother's and the sister's rooms are the same size. And from fact 2, the sister is the lead.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
150,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this down using logic and backward induction, considering the lions' perfect rationality and survival preference.

Let $N$ be the number of lions. The crucial factor for a lion deciding whether to eat the sheep is whether eating the sheep will ultimately lead to *that specific lion* being eaten (after turning into a sheep). A lion would rather eat grass forever than be eaten.

We need to analyze this problem starting from the simplest possible scenario (a small number of lions) and work our way up.

**Scenario 1: N = 1 lion, 1 sheep**

*   The single lion reaches the sheep.
*   The lion considers eating the sheep.
*   If the lion eats the sheep, it turns into a sheep. There are now 0 lions and 2 sheep (the original sheep is gone, the former lion is now a sheep).
*   Can this former lion (now a sheep) be eaten? No, because there are no other lions left.
*   So, in this scenario, eating the sheep does *not* lead to being eaten later.
*   The lion prefers eating sheep over grass (Rule 3). There is no negative consequence according to Rule 6.
*   Therefore, the lion *will* eat the sheep.

**Scenario 2: N = 2 lions, 1 sheep**

*   Lion 1 reaches the sheep.
*   Lion 1 considers eating the sheep.
*   If Lion 1 eats the sheep, Lion 1 turns into a sheep. The situation becomes: 1 lion (Lion 2) and 2 sheep (the original sheep is gone, Lion 1 is now a sheep).
*   Now, Lion 2 is faced with 1 lion and 2 sheep. Lion 2 is in the position of the single lion in Scenario 1. As we determined in Scenario 1, a single lion *will* eat a sheep.
*   Therefore, if Lion 1 eats the sheep and turns into a sheep, Lion 2 *will* eat Lion 1 (now a sheep).
*   Lion 1 knows this due to infinite logic.
*   Rule 6 states a lion would rather eat grass than be eaten. Since eating the sheep will lead to being eaten, Lion 1 will choose not to eat the sheep.
*   Therefore, the sheep will *not* be eaten in this scenario.

**Scenario 3: N = 3 lions, 1 sheep**

*   Lion 1 reaches the sheep.
*   Lion 1 considers eating the sheep.
*   If Lion 1 eats the sheep, Lion 1 turns into a sheep. The situation becomes: 2 lions (Lion 2, Lion 3) and 2 sheep (original gone, Lion 1 is now a sheep).
*   Now, are the 2 remaining lions (Lion 2, Lion 3) in a situation where they *will* eat one of the sheep (specifically, Lion 1, who is now a sheep)? This is essentially Scenario 2, but with 2 sheep instead of 1 (the number of available sheep doesn't change the core logic for the lions' decision; they just need *a* sheep to trigger the transformation rule).
*   As we determined in Scenario 2, with 2 lions and a sheep, the first lion *will not* eat the sheep because it would lead to being eaten by the last remaining lion (Scenario 1 outcome).
*   Therefore, if Lion 1 in the N=3 scenario eats the sheep and turns into a sheep, the 2 remaining lions *will not* eat Lion 1 (now a sheep).
*   Lion 1 knows this.
*   Eating the sheep will *not* lead to Lion 1 being eaten. Rule 6 is not negatively triggered.
*   Lion 1 prefers eating sheep over grass (Rule 3).
*   Therefore, Lion 1 *will* eat the sheep.

**Scenario 4: N = 4 lions, 1 sheep**

*   Lion 1 reaches the sheep.
*   Lion 1 considers eating the sheep.
*   If Lion 1 eats the sheep, Lion 1 turns into a sheep. The situation becomes: 3 lions and 2 sheep.
*   Now, are the 3 remaining lions in a situation where they *will* eat one of the sheep (Lion 1, now a sheep)? This is essentially Scenario 3 (3 lions and sheep).
*   As we determined in Scenario 3, with 3 lions and a sheep, the first lion *will* eat the sheep because it leads to a Scenario 2 outcome (2 lions) where the newly created sheep *is not* eaten.
*   Therefore, if Lion 1 in the N=4 scenario eats the sheep and turns into a sheep (leaving 3 lions and 2 sheep), one of those 3 lions *will* eat Lion 1 (now a sheep).
*   Lion 1 knows this.
*   Eating the sheep *will* lead to Lion 1 being eaten. Rule 6 states a lion would rather eat grass than be eaten.
*   Therefore, Lion 1 will choose not to eat the sheep.
*   The sheep will *not* be eaten in this scenario.

**Identifying the Pattern**

We see a pattern emerging based on the number of lions:
*   1 lion: Eats
*   2 lions: Doesn't eat
*   3 lions: Eats
*   4 lions: Doesn't eat

The pattern is: A lion will eat the sheep if and only if the number of lions is *odd*.
This is because the decision to eat is based on whether the lion-turned-sheep will be eaten by the *remaining* lions. If eating leads to a scenario with an *even* number of lions, the next lion won't eat, making it safe for the original lion. If eating leads to a scenario with an *odd* number of lions, the next lion *will* eat, making it unsafe for the original lion.

The logic propagates backwards:
*   A lion in state N eats if state N-1 is safe.
*   State N-1 is safe if a lion in state N-1 *doesn't* eat.
*   A lion in state N-1 *doesn't* eat if state N-2 is unsafe.
*   State N-2 is unsafe if a lion in state N-2 *does* eat.
*   ... down to state 1.

Since a lion in state 1 *does* eat, state 1 is unsafe for the *next* eater.
Since state 1 is unsafe, a lion in state 2 *doesn't* eat, making state 2 safe.
Since state 2 is safe, a lion in state 3 *does* eat, making state 3 unsafe.
Since state 3 is unsafe, a lion in state 4 *doesn't* eat, making state 4 safe.

A lion eats if the state number (N) is odd.
A lion does not eat if the state number (N) is even.

**Applying to the Problem**

We have 100 lions. 100 is an even number.
Based on the pattern, with an even number of lions, the first lion will determine that eating the sheep would ultimately lead to itself being eaten (due to the logical chain leading back to the N=1 eating scenario via the N=3, N=5, ... N=99 eating scenarios). To avoid being eaten (Rule 6), the first lion will choose not to eat the sheep.

The sheep will not be eaten.

Final answer: The sheep will not get eaten.",True
151,"During a recent plane and train spotting contest, five eager entrants were lined up ready to be tested on their spotting ability. They had each spotted a number of planes (26, 86, 123, 174, 250) and a number of trains (5, 42, 45, 98, 105). From the clues below, can you determine what colour shirt each was wearing, their position, their age (21, 23, 31, 36, 40) and the number of trains and planes spotted?
1. Bob spotted 44 less trains than planes.
2. Tom was 36 years old.
3. The person on the far right was 8 years younger than Bob, and spotted 174 planes.
4. Josh was wearing a yellow shirt and spotted 37 trains fewer than Bob.
5. The person who was wearing a green shirt, was 19 years younger than the person to his left.
6. Steven spotted 105 trains and 250 planes.
7. The person in the centre was 31 years old, was wearing a blue shirt and spotted 42 trains.
8. Doug, who was on the far left, spotted 26 planes, and spotted 72 trains more than planes.
9. The person who was wearing a red shirt was 4 years older than Tom and was not next to the person wearing a blue shirt.
10.The person who was next to the 31 year old, but not next to the person who spotted 26 planes, was wearing a orange shirt, and spotted 45 trains.",,"example:

2 Steven(green shirt)21,250,105
3 Bob(blue shirt)31,86,42
4 Tom(orange shirt)36,123,45
5 Josh(yellow shirt)23,174,5",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem.

Let the five entrants be at positions P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 from left to right. We need to determine the Name, Colour, Age, number of Planes, and number of Trains for each position.

Given lists:
Names: {Bob, Tom, Josh, Steven, Doug}
Colours: {Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange}
Ages: {21, 23, 31, 36, 40}
Planes: {26, 86, 123, 174, 250}
Trains: {5, 42, 45, 98, 105}

We will use a table to keep track of the information for each position:
| Position | Name | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P5 |  |  |  |  |  |

Let's process the clues:

1.  **Bob spotted 44 less trains than planes.**
    Let $P_{Bob}$ be Bob's planes and $T_{Bob}$ be Bob's trains. $T_{Bob} = P_{Bob} - 44$. Checking the given lists:
    If $P_{Bob} = 86$, $T_{Bob} = 86 - 44 = 42$. This pair (86, 42) is in the lists.
    No other pair in the lists satisfies this condition.
    So, Bob spotted 86 planes and 42 trains. Bob: Planes=86, Trains=42.

2.  **Tom was 36 years old.**
    Tom: Age=36.

3.  **The person on the far right was 8 years younger than Bob, and spotted 174 planes.**
    The far right is P5. P5 spotted 174 planes. P5's Age = Bob's Age - 8. We don't know Bob's age yet.
    P5: Planes=174.

4.  **Josh was wearing a yellow shirt and spotted 37 trains fewer than Bob.**
    Josh: Colour=Yellow. $T_{Josh} = T_{Bob} - 37$. From Clue 1, $T_{Bob}=42$.
    $T_{Josh} = 42 - 37 = 5$.
    Josh: Colour=Yellow, Trains=5.

5.  **The person who was wearing a green shirt, was 19 years younger than the person to his left.**
    Let the person in green be $Px$. Age($Px$, Green) = Age($Px-1$) - 19.
    Possible ages: {21, 23, 31, 36, 40}. The only pair with a difference of 19 is 40 and 21 (40 - 19 = 21).
    So, the person to the left is 40 years old, and the person in the green shirt is 21 years old.
    (Person to left of Green): Age=40. (Green shirt person): Age=21.
    The green shirt person cannot be P1 (no one to the left).

6.  **Steven spotted 105 trains and 250 planes.**
    Steven: Trains=105, Planes=250.

7.  **The person in the centre was 31 years old, was wearing a blue shirt and spotted 42 trains.**
    The centre is P3. P3: Age=31, Colour=Blue, Trains=42.

Comparing Clue 7 with Clue 1 (Bob: Trains=42), we see that the person at P3 must be Bob.
P3: Name=Bob, Age=31, Colour=Blue, Trains=42, Planes=86 (from Clue 1).

Let's update the table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P3 | Bob | Blue | 31 | 86 | 42 |
| P4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P5 |  |  | 23 | 174 |  | (from Clue 3: P5 Planes=174, P5 Age = Bob's Age - 8 = 31 - 8 = 23)

Remaining Names: {Tom, Josh, Steven, Doug}
Remaining Colours: {Red, Green, Yellow, Orange}
Remaining Ages: {21, 36, 40} (31 is P3, 23 is P5)
Remaining Planes: {26, 123, 250} (86 is P3, 174 is P5)
Remaining Trains: {5, 45, 98, 105} (42 is P3)

From Clue 5 (Green shirt person is 21, person to left is 40):
The Green shirt person cannot be P1 (no left), P3 (Age 31), P4 (person to left is P3, Age 31, not 40), P5 (person to left is P4).
The only possibility is P2. If P2 is Green (Age 21), then P1 must be Age 40.
P1: Age=40.
P2: Colour=Green, Age=21.

Update table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 |  |  | 40 |  |  |
| P2 |  | Green | 21 |  |  |
| P3 | Bob | Blue | 31 | 86 | 42 |
| P4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| P5 |  |  | 23 | 174 |  |

Remaining Ages: {36}. The only position left for Age 36 is P4.
P4: Age=36. From Clue 2, Tom is 36. So P4 is Tom.
P4: Name=Tom, Age=36.

Remaining Names: {Josh, Steven, Doug}
Remaining Colours: {Red, Yellow, Orange}
Remaining Planes: {26, 123, 250}
Remaining Trains: {5, 45, 98, 105}

From Clue 8: **Doug, who was on the far left (P1), spotted 26 planes, and spotted 72 trains more than planes.**
P1 is Doug. P1 Planes=26. P1 Trains = P1 Planes + 72 = 26 + 72 = 98.
P1: Name=Doug, Planes=26, Trains=98. (Age 40 is already known for P1).

Update table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Doug |  | 40 | 26 | 98 |
| P2 |  | Green | 21 |  |  |
| P3 | Bob | Blue | 31 | 86 | 42 |
| P4 | Tom |  | 36 |  |  |

Remaining Names: {Josh, Steven}
Remaining Colours: {Red, Yellow, Orange}
Remaining Planes: {123, 250}
Remaining Trains: {5, 45, 105}

From Clue 4: **Josh was wearing a yellow shirt and spotted 5 trains.**
From Clue 6: **Steven spotted 105 trains and 250 planes.**

Let's place Josh and Steven. The available positions are P2 and P5.
- If Josh is P2: P2 is Josh, Colour=Yellow, Trains=5. But P2's colour is Green. Impossible.
- If Josh is P5: P5 is Josh, Colour=Yellow, Trains=5. P5 Age is 23, Planes 174. This is possible.

- If Steven is P2: P2 is Steven, Trains=105, Planes=250. P2 Colour is Green, Age 21. This is possible.
- If Steven is P5: P5 is Steven, Trains=105, Planes=250. P5 Planes is 174, not 250. Impossible.

So, Josh must be P5 and Steven must be P2.
P5: Name=Josh, Colour=Yellow, Trains=5. (Matches existing P5 info: Age 23, Planes 174).
P2: Name=Steven, Trains=105, Planes=250. (Matches existing P2 info: Colour Green, Age 21).

Update table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Doug |  | 40 | 26 | 98 |
| P2 | Steven | Green | 21 | 250 | 105 |
| P3 | Bob | Blue | 31 | 86 | 42 |
| P4 | Tom |  | 36 |  |  |
| P5 | Josh | Yellow | 23 | 174 | 5 |

Remaining Colours: {Red, Orange}
Remaining Planes: {123}
Remaining Trains: {45}

The remaining Planes (123) and Trains (45) must belong to P4.
P4: Name=Tom, Age=36, Planes=123, Trains=45.

Update table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |

| P4 | Tom |  | 36 | 123 | 45 |
| P5 | Josh | Yellow | 23 | 174 | 5 |

Remaining Colours: {Red, Orange}. These must be for P1 and P4.

From Clue 9: **The person who was wearing a red shirt was 4 years older than Tom and was not next to the person wearing a blue shirt.**
Tom's age is 36. The person in red is 36 + 4 = 40 years old.
P1 is 40 years old. So P1 is wearing the red shirt.
P1: Colour=Red.
The person in red (P1) was not next to the person in blue (P3). P1 is next to P2. This condition is satisfied.

Update table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Doug | Red | 40 | 26 | 98 |
| P2 | Steven | Green | 21 | 250 | 105 |
| P3 | Bob | Blue | 31 | 86 | 42 |
| P4 | Tom |  | 36 | 123 | 45 |
| P5 | Josh | Yellow | 23 | 174 | 5 |

Remaining Colour: {Orange}. This must be for P4.
P4: Colour=Orange.

Final table:
| Position | Name  | Colour | Age | Planes | Trains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Doug | Red | 40 | 26 | 98 |

| P4 | Tom | Orange | 36 | 123 | 45 |
| P5 | Josh | Yellow | 23 | 174 | 5 |

Let's check Clue 10 for consistency: **The person who was next to the 31 year old, but not next to the person who spotted 26 planes, was wearing a orange shirt, and spotted 45 trains.**
The 31-year-old is P3 (Bob). The people next to P3 are P2 and P4.
The person who spotted 26 planes is P1 (Doug).
The person described is either P2 or P4, and is *not* next to P1.
P2 is next to P1. So P2 is not the person.
P4 is not next to P1. So P4 is the person.
The clue says this person (P4) was wearing an orange shirt and spotted 45 trains.
Our table shows P4 (Tom) is wearing Orange and spotted 45 trains. This is consistent.

All names, colours, ages, planes, and trains values have been used exactly once. All clues are satisfied.

The final arrangement from left to right (Position 1 to 5) is:

Position 1: Doug, Red shirt, 40 years old, 26 planes, 98 trains.
Position 2: Steven, Green shirt, 21 years old, 250 planes, 105 trains.
Position 3: Bob, Blue shirt, 31 years old, 86 planes, 42 trains.
Position 4: Tom, Orange shirt, 36 years old, 123 planes, 45 trains.
Position 5: Josh, Yellow shirt, 23 years old, 174 planes, 5 trains.

Final answer should list the attributes for each person.

Doug: Red shirt, Position 1, 40 years old, 26 planes, 98 trains.
Steven: Green shirt, Position 2, 21 years old, 250 planes, 105 trains.
Bob: Blue shirt, Position 3, 31 years old, 86 planes, 42 trains.
Tom: Orange shirt, Position 4, 36 years old, 123 planes, 45 trains.
Josh: Yellow shirt, Position 5, 23 years old, 174 planes, 5 trains.

Final Answer presentation could be a list by position or by person. The question asks ""can you determine what colour shirt each was wearing, their position, their age..."". Listing by position is clearer regarding the ""position"" attribute.

Final answer:
Position 1: Doug (Red shirt, 40 years old, 26 planes, 98 trains)
Position 2: Steven (Green shirt, 21 years old, 250 planes, 105 trains)
Position 3: Bob (Blue shirt, 31 years old, 86 planes, 42 trains)
Position 4: Tom (Orange shirt, 36 years old, 123 planes, 45 trains)
Position 5: Josh (Yellow shirt, 23 years old, 174 planes, 5 trains)

153,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan.

Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village.

154,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?",,"The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.
As they were good for a meal, I suppose the kids weren't so rotten after all!",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine how the three guilty kids are punished:

1.  **Identify the core event:** The narrative describes three kids who steal, are chased, cause injury to Old Man Justice, are later rounded up, and are the subject of a dinner called the 'Repast of Right'.
2.  **Analyze the context of the dinner:** Old Man Justice's speech takes place *at* this dinner. The kids are clearly the topic (""these few,"" ""these ones"").
3.  **Identify the outcome for the kids:** Old Man Justice explicitly states, ""No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!"" This is a clear declaration that the kids will be killed. ""Shall not breathe"" is a common euphemism for death.
4.  **Connect the death to the dinner:** The speech ends with ""Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat."" This strongly links the act of eating at the dinner to the ""justice"" that has been or is being served upon the kids.
5.  **Consider the principle of justice stated:** Old Man Justice describes their method as ""Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'"" This principle governs how they mete out their ""justice."" This phrase sets up a ratio or correspondence related to the punishment.
6.  **Evaluate the ""one for two"" principle in relation to the number of kids:** There are three kids. The ""one for two"" rule must apply to these three kids. How can ""one for two"" apply to three individuals? It could mean:
    *   One unit of something for every two kids (doesn't work neatly with 3 kids).
    *   Two units of something for every one kid (3 kids * 2 units/kid = 6 units). This yields a whole number.
    *   One unit represents two kids (would need 1.5 units to represent 3 kids).
    *   Two units represent one kid (would need 6 units to represent 3 kids).
    Given the context of a dinner where eating is involved, and the non-cannibal constraint (see next step), the ""units"" are most likely items of food being eaten. The most logical interpretation of ""one for two"" applied to three kids in this scenario is that for every one kid, two items are consumed, or conversely, that for every two kids, one item is consumed. The former (two items per kid) works perfectly with 3 kids, resulting in 6 items. The latter doesn't yield a whole number of items for 3 kids.
7.  **Incorporate the non-cannibal constraint:** The prompt explicitly states that Old Man Justice and his group are not cannibals. This is crucial because the kids are killed (""shall not breathe""), and the dinner involves eating, and this eating is linked to the justice served upon the kids. If they *were* cannibals, the interpretation would be straightforward: they killed the kids and are eating their bodies. Since they are *not* cannibals, they cannot be eating the kids.
8.  **Synthesize the findings:**
    *   The kids are killed as punishment.
    *   A dinner takes place where eating is linked to this justice.
    *   The group are not cannibals, so they are not eating the kids.
    *   The principle ""one for two"" guides their justice process, likely related to the meal.
    Combining these points, the killing of the kids is the primary punishment. The ""Repast of Right"" is a ritualistic or symbolic meal accompanying this act of justice. The ""one for two"" rule dictates the number of items eaten at this meal in relation to the number of perpetrators. Since there are three kids, and the most plausible way for ""one for two"" to apply to three is as ""two items for each one kid,"" they likely eat a total of six items at the dinner. This meal is the final act of their ""justice"" serving process, confirming that the kids are dead and that this is their due according to the group's strange principle.

Therefore, the kids are punished by being killed, and the group solidifies this act of ""justice"" by holding a ritual dinner where they eat a specific number of food items determined by their ""one for two"" principle (likely six items) in relation to the three kids.

Final answer: The three guilty kids are killed (""no more shall they breathe""). This is the primary punishment. As part of the ""justice"" served, Old Man Justice and his group hold a dinner where they eat food (since they are not cannibals, it is not the kids themselves). The ""one for two"" principle dictates the consumption during this ritual meal, most likely meaning they eat two food items for each of the three kids, totaling six items, as a symbolic act accompanying the killing.",True

160,"Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?",,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.
(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.  Obviously, I've changed the names).",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the reasoning to solve the problem:

Let E represent the total value of Biggie's estate.
The will specifies how the estate is to be divided in two hypothetical scenarios:

1.  **If the child were a boy:** The will states the son gets 2/3 of the estate and the widow gets 1/3 of the estate. This scenario involves only two beneficiaries, the son and the widow. The division implies a ratio of inheritance between the son and the widow. Let S be the son's share and W be the widow's share in this scenario. S = (2/3)E and W = (1/3)E. The ratio of the son's share to the widow's share is S : W = (2/3)E : (1/3)E = 2 : 1. This suggests that, according to Biggie's will, a son should inherit twice as much as the widow.

2.  **If the child were a girl:** The will states the widow gets 2/3 of the estate and the daughter gets 1/3 of the estate. This scenario involves only two beneficiaries, the widow and the daughter. The division implies a ratio of inheritance between the widow and the daughter. Let W' be the widow's share and D be the daughter's share in this scenario. W' = (2/3)E and D = (1/3)E. The ratio of the widow's share to the daughter's share is W' : D = (2/3)E : (1/3)E = 2 : 1. This suggests that, according to Biggie's will, the widow should inherit twice as much as a daughter.

Biggie died, and twins were born: a boy (Manny) and a girl (Goodie). So, the actual beneficiaries are the Widow (Faerie), the Son (Manny), and the Daughter (Goodie). The will did not explicitly cover this situation with both a son and a daughter.

The task is to determine a fair division of the estate among the Widow (W), Son (S), and Daughter (D) that reflects the principles established in the will. The most reasonable interpretation of the will's principles in this new situation is to apply the relative proportions it established.

From scenario 1 (Boy): The principle is that the Son's inheritance should be twice the Widow's inheritance when they are the beneficiaries concerned by this rule. So, in the actual situation, we can infer that the Son's share (S) should be related to the Widow's share (W) by the ratio S : W = 2 : 1, or S = 2W.

From scenario 2 (Girl): The principle is that the Widow's inheritance should be twice the Daughter's inheritance when they are the beneficiaries concerned by this rule. So, in the actual situation, we can infer that the Widow's share (W) should be related to the Daughter's share (D) by the ratio W : D = 2 : 1, or W = 2D.

Now we have a system of relationships between the shares of the three beneficiaries:
1. S = 2W
2. W = 2D

We can express all shares in terms of a single variable, for example, D.
From (2), W = 2D.
Substitute this into (1): S = 2 * (2D) = 4D.

So, the shares of the Son, Widow, and Daughter are in the ratio S : W : D = 4D : 2D : D, which simplifies to 4 : 2 : 1.

These shares must represent proportions of the total estate E, and their sum must equal the entire estate. Let the proportions be 4k, 2k, and k for the Son, Widow, and Daughter, respectively.
The sum of the proportions is 4k + 2k + k = 7k.
This sum must equal 1 (representing 100% of the estate).
So, 7k = 1, which means k = 1/7.

Now we can determine the individual shares:
- The Daughter's share is k = 1/7 of the estate.
- The Widow's share is 2k = 2 * (1/7) = 2/7 of the estate.
- The Son's share is 4k = 4 * (1/7) = 4/7 of the estate.

Let's verify these shares against the principles derived from the will:
- Is the Son's share twice the Widow's share? 4/7 = 2 * (2/7). Yes, 4/7 = 4/7.
- Is the Widow's share twice the Daughter's share? 2/7 = 2 * (1/7). Yes, 2/7 = 2/7.
- Do the shares sum to the whole estate? 4/7 + 2/7 + 1/7 = 7/7 = 1. Yes.

This division respects the relative priorities and proportions established by Biggie in his will, adapting them logically to the unforeseen situation of having both a son and a daughter. The son is favored over the widow (2:1 ratio), and the widow is favored over the daughter (2:1 ratio), leading to a hierarchical distribution where the son receives the largest share, followed by the widow, and then the daughter.

The final answer is $\boxed{The son gets 4/7, the widow gets 2/7, and the daughter gets 1/7 of the estate}$.",True

You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.

Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.

Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.

Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.

a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
166,"Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.

Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.

The twelfth and last man says: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers.""
Who are the liars?","It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","If there are exactly N liars, then the last N men are truthtellers, leaving the first (12-N) men to be liars.
Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let $N=12$ be the number of men in the room. Let the men be denoted by $M_1, M_2, \dots, M_{12}$.
Each man is either a truth-teller or a liar. Truth-tellers always state true propositions, and liars always state false propositions.
Let $n_T$ be the number of truth-tellers among the 12 men. $n_T$ is an integer between 0 and 12, inclusive.

Let $S_i$ be the statement made by the $i$-th man, $M_i$.
According to the problem description:
$M_1$ says: ""None of us is a truthteller."" This statement is equivalent to ""$n_T = 0$"".
$M_2$ says: ""At most one of us is a truthteller."" This statement is equivalent to ""$n_T \le 1$"".
$M_3$ says: ""At most two of us are truthtellers."" This statement is equivalent to ""$n_T \le 2$"".
...
$M_i$ says: ""At most $i-1$ of us are truthtellers."" This statement is equivalent to ""$n_T \le i-1$"".
...
$M_{12}$ says: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers."" This statement is equivalent to ""$n_T \le 11$"".

So, the statement $S_i$ made by man $M_i$ is ""$n_T \le i-1$"" for $i=1, 2, \dots, 12$.

By definition, a man $M_i$ is a truth-teller if and only if his statement $S_i$ is true.
Also, a man $M_i$ is a liar if and only if his statement $S_i$ is false.

Let's assume that the number of truth-tellers in the room is exactly $k$, where $k$ is an integer from 0 to 12. So, $n_T = k$.
Now let's evaluate the truth value of each statement $S_i$ based on this assumption.
The statement $S_i$ is ""$k \le i-1$"".
This statement $S_i$ is true if $k \le i-1$, which is equivalent to $i \ge k+1$.
This statement $S_i$ is false if $k > i-1$, which is equivalent to $i \le k$.

So, if there are $k$ truth-tellers:
The statements $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k$ are false, because for these values of $i$ (from 1 to $k$), $i \le k$, so $i-1 < k$.
The statements $S_{k+1}, S_{k+2}, \dots, S_{12}$ are true, because for these values of $i$ (from $k+1$ to 12), $i > k$, so $i-1 \ge k$.

Now we relate this back to who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.
If $n_T=k$:
The men $M_1, M_2, \dots, M_k$ make false statements ($S_1, \dots, S_k$ are false). Therefore, these $k$ men must be liars.
The men $M_{k+1}, M_{k+2}, \dots, M_{12}$ make true statements ($S_{k+1}, \dots, S_{12}$ are true). Therefore, these men must be truth-tellers.

Under the assumption that there are $k$ truth-tellers, the set of truth-tellers must be $\{M_{k+1}, M_{k+2}, \dots, M_{12}\}$.
The number of truth-tellers in this set is the number of elements from $M_{k+1}$ to $M_{12}$, which is $12 - (k+1) + 1 = 12 - k$.

For our initial assumption ($n_T=k$) to be consistent with the deduction from the statements, the assumed number of truth-tellers must equal the derived number of truth-tellers.
So, we must have $k = 12 - k$.

Solving this equation for $k$:
$k + k = 12$
$2k = 12$
$k = 6$.

This implies that the only consistent number of truth-tellers is $n_T=6$.

Let's verify this solution. If there are exactly 6 truth-tellers ($n_T=6$):
The statements are:
$S_i: 6 \le i-1$.
$S_i$ is true if $i-1 \ge 6$, which means $i \ge 7$. So, $S_7, S_8, \dots, S_{12}$ are true.
$S_i$ is false if $i-1 < 6$, which means $i < 7$. So, $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_6$ are false.

According to the rule that truth-tellers make true statements and liars make false ones:
Since $S_1, \dots, S_6$ are false, $M_1, \dots, M_6$ must be liars.
Since $S_7, \dots, S_{12}$ are true, $M_7, \dots, M_{12}$ must be truth-tellers.

In this scenario, the liars are $M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5, M_6$. The truth-tellers are $M_7, M_8, M_9, M_{10}, M_{11}, M_{12}$.
The number of truth-tellers is 6, which is consistent with our assumption $n_T=6$.

The set of liars is $\{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5, M_6\}$.

Let's check a few statements again with $n_T=6$:
$M_1$ (liar) says ""$n_T \le 0$"". Since $n_T=6$, $6 \le 0$ is false. This is consistent with $M_1$ being a liar.
$M_6$ (liar) says ""$n_T \le 5$"". Since $n_T=6$, $6 \le 5$ is false. This is consistent with $M_6$ being a liar.
$M_7$ (truth-teller) says ""$n_T \le 6$"". Since $n_T=6$, $6 \le 6$ is true. This is consistent with $M_7$ being a truth-teller.
$M_{12}$ (truth-teller) says ""$n_T \le 11$"". Since $n_T=6$, $6 \le 11$ is true. This is consistent with $M_{12}$ being a truth-teller.

The solution $n_T=6$, with $M_1, \dots, M_6$ being liars and $M_7, \dots, M_{12}$ being truth-tellers, is perfectly consistent with all the given conditions.
We have also shown that this is the only possible value for $n_T$.

The question asks ""Who are the liars?"".
The liars are the men $M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5, M_6$.

The final answer is $\boxed{The first six men (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6) are the liars.}$.",True

If the answer is no, the card on the left is an ace.  This solution works because if you're pointing to an ace then he's obviously telling the truth and if you're pointing to the jack the answer doesn't matter anyway because you will pick one of the other two which are both aces.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, I understand the problem and the constraints. I need to devise a single yes/no question, pointing to one of the three face-down cards, such that the answer allows me to definitively identify one of the ace cards. The challenge lies in the fact that pointing to the Jack results in a random answer.

Here is my reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the goal:** Find one of the two Aces.
2.  **Identify the tools:** One yes/no question, pointing to one card (Card P).
3.  **Identify the rules for the answer:**
    *   If Card P is an Ace (A), the answer is truthful.
    *   If Card P is the Jack (J), the answer is random (50% Yes, 50% No).
4.  **Analyze the challenge:** The random answer from the Jack makes a direct question about the pointed card or another card potentially unreliable. A simple question like ""Is this card an Ace?"" when pointed at a card will result in an ambiguous ""Yes"" if the card is either an Ace (truth) or a Jack (random).

5.  **Develop a strategy:** I need to formulate a question and an interpretation of the answer such that, regardless of which card I point to, the response allows me to pinpoint an Ace with certainty. The key is to leverage the *truthfulness* when pointing at an Ace versus the *randomness* when pointing at the Jack.

6.  **Consider asking about a different card:** If I point to Card 1 (C1) but ask about Card 2 (C2), the truthfulness of the answer still depends *only* on C1. If C1 is Ace, the answer about C2 is true. If C1 is Jack, the answer about C2 is random.

7.  **Let the cards be C1, C2, and C3.** I will choose to point at C1 and ask a question about C2.

8.  **Formulate the question:** Let's try a simple question about the identity of C2: ""Is Card C2 an Ace?"" I point at C1 while asking this question about C2.

9.  **Analyze the possible scenarios based on the identity of C1 (the card I point to) and the answer given:**

    *   **Scenario A: Card C1 is an Ace (A).**
        *   The man will answer truthfully about Card C2.
        *   *If C2 is an Ace (A):* The truthful answer is ""Yes"". The card configuration is A A J (where C3 must be the Jack).
        *   *If C2 is the Jack (J):* The truthful answer is ""No"". The card configuration is A J A (where C3 must be the other Ace).

    *   **Scenario B: Card C1 is the Jack (J).**
        *   The man will answer randomly (""Yes"" or ""No"") about Card C2.
        *   Since C1 is the Jack, the other two cards, C2 and C3, must both be Aces. The card configuration is J A A.
        *   *If he answers ""Yes"":* This was a random answer. C1 is J, C2 is A, C3 is A.
        *   *If he answers ""No"":* This was a random answer. C1 is J, C2 is A, C3 is A.

10. **Analyze the outcome based on the man's answer:**

    *   **If the man answers ""Yes"":**
        *   This happened in Scenario A where C1=A and C2=A. In this case, C2 is an Ace.
        *   This happened in Scenario B where C1=J and the random answer was ""Yes"". In this case, C1 is the Jack, so C2 and C3 are both Aces. In this case too, C2 is an Ace.
        *   Therefore, if the answer is ""Yes"", Card C2 must be an Ace.

    *   **If the man answers ""No"":**
        *   This happened in Scenario A where C1=A and C2=J. In this case, C1 is an Ace and C2 is the Jack. Since there is only one Jack, the remaining card, C3, must be the other Ace.
        *   This happened in Scenario B where C1=J and the random answer was ""No"". In this case, C1 is the Jack, so C2 and C3 are both Aces. In this case too, C3 is an Ace.
        *   Therefore, if the answer is ""No"", Card C3 must be an Ace.

11. **Conclusion:** By pointing at C1 and asking ""Is C2 an Ace?"", I can guarantee finding an Ace: If the answer is Yes, C2 is an Ace. If the answer is No, C3 is an Ace.

12. **Refine the procedure:** I will choose two specific cards, say the leftmost (C1) and the middle card (C2). I will point at the leftmost card (C1). I will ask ""Is the middle card (C2) an Ace?"". If the answer is Yes, I will pick the middle card (C2). If the answer is No, I will pick the rightmost card (C3).

Final answer: I will point to the leftmost card and ask ""Is the middle card an Ace?"". If he says Yes, I will choose the middle card. If he says No, I will choose the rightmost card.",True

Hence, possible groups are:
PR - S - UV
PR - S - VW
PR - S - WU
PR - T - UV
PR - T - VW
PQ - R - UV
PQ - R - VW
PQ - R - WU
Hence,  8 different groups are possible.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the roles in the five-person Special Task Group be Leader (L), Bomb-Expert (BE), and Soldier (S).
The group must have 1 Leader, 2 Bomb-Experts, and 2 Soldiers.

The available people for each role are:
Bomb-Experts (BE): P, Q, R
Leaders (L): R, S, T
Soldiers (S): U, V, W

Let G be the set of 5 people in the group. The group G consists of 1 Leader, 2 Bomb-Experts, and 2 Soldiers selected from the available pools.

We have two constraints:
1. P and R prefer to work with each other in the same team. We interpret this as a strict condition: P and R must either both be in the group G or both not be in the group G. This can be written as (P ∈ G ∧ R ∈ G) ∨ (P ∉ G ∧ R ∉ G).
2. T prefers to work only if V works. We interpret this as a conditional requirement: If T is in the group G (as the Leader, since T is only available as Leader), then V must be in the group G (as a Soldier, since V is only available as Soldier). This can be written as (T ∈ G) => (V ∈ G).

Let's analyze Constraint 1.
Case 1: P ∉ G and R ∉ G.
If P is not in G, P cannot be one of the 2 Bomb-Experts. The available Bomb-Experts would be {Q, R}. But R is also not in G, so the available Bomb-Experts are {Q}. We need to select 2 Bomb-Experts, but only Q is available. This is impossible.
Therefore, the case where P and R are neither in the group is not possible.

Case 2: P ∈ G and R ∈ G.
P must be one of the 2 Bomb-Experts, as P is only available as a Bomb-Expert.
R must be in the group. R can be selected as a Bomb-Expert or as the Leader, as R is available for both roles.
This leads to two possibilities for the roles of P and R within the group:

Possibility A: R is the Leader and P is a Bomb-Expert.
- Leader selection: R must be the Leader. There is 1 choice for the Leader ({R}).",True

Let's denote the people by their initials: Tommy Tombstone (TT), Lance Lamers (LL), Brett Brown (BB), Mitch Monday (MM), Peter Poultry (PP), Daniel Dusk (DD), Sam Sunny (SS), Keri Kernel (KK), Jack Jill (JJ), and Harry Hills (HH).
We will represent the finishing order using inequalities, where A < B means A finished before B, and A > B means A finished after B.

Let's list all the constraints from the clues:
1. TT > LL, TT > BB, TT < MM
2. PP < DD, PP < LL
3. SS > PP, SS < JJ, SS < HH
4. KK > PP, KK > MM, KK > TT
5. LL > BB, LL > DD, LL < JJ, LL < MM
6. MM > SS, MM > BB
7. BB < JJ, BB < MM, BB < PP
8. DD < KK, DD < TT, DD > SS
9. JJ < KK, JJ < TT, JJ < MM, JJ > PP, JJ > DD
10. HH < MM, HH > LL, HH > JJ, HH > TT

Let's start building a chain of finishers by identifying who finished before or after multiple people.

From clue 7, BB < PP. From clue 2, PP < DD and PP < LL. From clue 3, PP < SS. From clue 4, PP < KK. From clue 9, PP < JJ.
So, BB < PP < {DD, LL, SS, KK, JJ}.

From clue 8, SS < DD. From clue 3, SS < JJ and SS < HH and SS < MM (from 6).
So, PP < SS < {DD, JJ, HH, MM}.

From clue 8, DD < TT and DD < KK.
So, SS < DD < {TT, KK}.

Let's combine the partial chains: BB < PP < SS < DD.

From clue 5, DD < LL.
So, BB < PP < SS < DD < LL.

From clue 1, LL < TT. From clue 5, LL < MM. From clue 5, LL < JJ. From clue 10, LL < HH.
So, DD < LL < {TT, MM, JJ, HH}.

Combining with the chain: BB < PP < SS < DD < LL < TT.

From clue 1, TT < MM.
So, BB < PP < SS < DD < LL < TT < MM.

From clue 4, MM < KK.
So, BB < PP < SS < DD < LL < TT < MM < KK.
This gives us a chain of 8 people in order: BB < PP < SS < DD < LL < TT < MM < KK.

Now let's place the remaining two people, JJ and HH, into this chain.

Consider JJ. From clue 9: JJ > PP, JJ > DD. Our chain has BB(1) < PP(2) < SS(3) < DD(4) < LL(5) < TT(6) < MM(7) < KK(8).
JJ is after PP (2nd) and DD (4th).
From clue 9: JJ < KK, JJ < TT, JJ < MM. JJ is before TT (6th), MM (7th), and KK (8th).
So JJ must be after DD (4th) but before TT (6th).
The current chain segment is DD < LL < TT.
We also have JJ > LL (clue 5). So JJ must be after LL (5th).
Thus, JJ is after LL (5th) and before TT (6th). This uniquely places JJ between LL and TT.
The updated chain is: BB < PP < SS < DD < LL < JJ < TT < MM < KK.
This chain now has 9 people. Let's update their relative positions:
BB(1) < PP(2) < SS(3) < DD(4) < LL(5) < JJ(6) < TT(7) < MM(8) < KK(9).

Finally, consider HH. From clue 3: HH > SS. SS is at position 3. HH is after position 3.
From clue 10: HH < MM, HH > LL, HH > JJ, HH > TT.
Using the 9-person chain:
HH > LL (5th), HH > JJ (6th), HH > TT (7th). So HH is after the 7th position.
HH < MM (8th). So HH is before the 8th position.
This uniquely places HH between TT (7th) and MM (8th).
The final chain is: BB < PP < SS < DD < LL < JJ < TT < HH < MM < KK.
This chain contains all 10 people. Let's list them in order and check all clues.

The proposed order:
1st: BB (Brett Brown)
2nd: PP (Peter Poultry)
3rd: SS (Sam Sunny)
4th: DD (Daniel Dusk)
5th: LL (Lance Lamers)
6th: JJ (Jack Jill)
7th: TT (Tommy Tombstone)
8th: HH (Harry Hills)
9th: MM (Mitch Monday)
10th: KK (Keri Kernel)

Let's verify all clues using these positions:

Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;
39-21-66-48

Eric = The Golden Pleasure

Berrick = The Devine Lightning
Derek = The Rusting Bucket

Let the four sons be Derek (D), Berrick (B), Eric (E), and Merick (M).
Let the four cars be The Silver Dream (SD), The Golden Pleasure (GP), The Devine Lightning (DL), and The Rusting Bucket (RB).
Each son receives exactly one car, and each car is given to exactly one son.

The nine conditional statements are translated into logical implications of the form ""If A, then B"", where ""A will not happen unless B"" is equivalent to ""If A happens, then B must happen"".

1.  If Derek gets The Golden Pleasure, then Berrick gets The Silver Dream and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket.
    $G(D, GP) \implies G(B, SD) \land G(E, RB)$
2.  If Berrick gets The Rusting Bucket, then Merick gets The Devine Lightning and Derek gets The Silver Dream.
    $G(B, RB) \implies G(M, DL) \land G(D, SD)$
3.  If Eric gets The Devine Lightning, then Derek gets The Golden Pleasure and Berrick gets The Silver Dream.
    $G(E, DL) \implies G(D, GP) \land G(B, SD)$
4.  If Derek gets The Silver Dream, then Merick gets The Devine Lightning and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket.
    $G(D, SD) \implies G(M, DL) \land G(E, RB)$
5.  If Berrick gets The Silver Dream, then Derek gets The Devine Lightning and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket.
    $G(B, SD) \implies G(D, DL) \land G(E, RB)$
6.  If Derek gets The Devine Lightning, then Berrick gets The Golden Pleasure and Merick gets The Silver Dream.
    $G(D, DL) \implies G(B, GP) \land G(M, SD)$
7.  If Merick gets The Devine Lightning, then Berrick gets The Golden Pleasure and Derek gets The Rusting Bucket.
    $G(M, DL) \implies G(B, GP) \land G(D, RB)$
8.  If Derek gets The Rusting Bucket, then Berrick gets The Devine Lightning and Eric gets The Golden Pleasure.
    $G(D, RB) \implies G(B, DL) \land G(E, GP)$
9.  If Merick gets The Silver Dream, then Eric gets The Golden Pleasure.
    $G(M, SD) \implies G(E, GP)$

We will test possibilities for Derek's car, as he appears in many statements.

Step 1: Assume Derek gets The Golden Pleasure ($G(D, GP)$).
According to statement 1, if $G(D, GP)$, then $G(B, SD) \land G(E, RB)$.
So, Berrick gets The Silver Dream ($G(B, SD)$) and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket ($G(E, RB)$).
According to statement 5, if $G(B, SD)$, then $G(D, DL) \land G(E, RB)$.
Since we deduced $G(B, SD)$, it must be true that $G(D, DL)$ and $G(E, RB)$.
So, Derek gets The Devine Lightning ($G(D, DL)$).
This leads to Derek getting both The Golden Pleasure ($G(D, GP)$) and The Devine Lightning ($G(D, DL)$). This is a contradiction, as one son can only receive one car.
Therefore, the initial assumption is false. Derek does not get The Golden Pleasure ($\neg G(D, GP)$).

Step 2: Assume Derek gets The Silver Dream ($G(D, SD)$).
According to statement 4, if $G(D, SD)$, then $G(M, DL) \land G(E, RB)$.
So, Merick gets The Devine Lightning ($G(M, DL)$) and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket ($G(E, RB)$).
According to statement 7, if $G(M, DL)$, then $G(B, GP) \land G(D, RB)$.
Since we deduced $G(M, DL)$, it must be true that $G(B, GP)$ and $G(D, RB)$.
So, Derek gets The Rusting Bucket ($G(D, RB)$).
This leads to Derek getting both The Silver Dream ($G(D, SD)$) and The Rusting Bucket ($G(D, RB)$). This is a contradiction.
Therefore, the initial assumption is false. Derek does not get The Silver Dream ($\neg G(D, SD)$).

Step 3: Use the fact $\neg G(D, SD)$ in other statements.
Consider statement 2: $G(B, RB) \implies G(M, DL) \land G(D, SD)$.
Since $\neg G(D, SD)$ is true, the conjunction $G(M, DL) \land G(D, SD)$ is false.
For the implication $G(B, RB) \implies \text{False}$ to be true, the antecedent $G(B, RB)$ must be false.
Therefore, Berrick does not get The Rusting Bucket ($\neg G(B, RB)$).

Step 4: Assume Derek gets The Devine Lightning ($G(D, DL)$).
According to statement 6, if $G(D, DL)$, then $G(B, GP) \land G(M, SD)$.
So, Berrick gets The Golden Pleasure ($G(B, GP)$) and Merick gets The Silver Dream ($G(M, SD)$).
According to statement 9, if $G(M, SD)$, then $G(E, GP)$.
Since we deduced $G(M, SD)$, it must be true that Eric gets The Golden Pleasure ($G(E, GP)$).
This leads to Berrick getting The Golden Pleasure ($G(B, GP)$) and Eric getting The Golden Pleasure ($G(E, GP)$). This is a contradiction, as only one son can receive The Golden Pleasure.
Therefore, the initial assumption is false. Derek does not get The Devine Lightning ($\neg G(D, DL)$).

Step 5: Determine Derek's car by elimination.
We have concluded that Derek does not get The Golden Pleasure ($\neg G(D, GP)$), does not get The Silver Dream ($\neg G(D, SD)$), and does not get The Devine Lightning ($\neg G(D, DL)$).
Since Derek must receive one of the four cars, the only remaining possibility is that Derek gets The Rusting Bucket.
So, Derek gets The Rusting Bucket ($G(D, RB)$).

Step 6: Use the fact $G(D, RB)$ to determine other assignments.
Consider statement 8: $G(D, RB) \implies G(B, DL) \land G(E, GP)$.
Since $G(D, RB)$ is true, the consequent $G(B, DL) \land G(E, GP)$ must be true.
So, Berrick gets The Devine Lightning ($G(B, DL)$) and Eric gets The Golden Pleasure ($G(E, GP)$).

Step 7: Determine the final assignment by elimination.
We have determined the cars for Derek (RB), Berrick (DL), and Eric (GP).
The only son left is Merick, and the only car left is The Silver Dream.
Therefore, Merick must get The Silver Dream ($G(M, SD)$).

Step 8: Verify the complete assignment against all statements.
The proposed assignment is:
Derek gets The Rusting Bucket ($G(D, RB)$).
Berrick gets The Devine Lightning ($G(B, DL)$).
Eric gets The Golden Pleasure ($G(E, GP)$).
Merick gets The Silver Dream ($G(M, SD)$).

Let's check the nine statements:
1. $G(D, GP) \implies G(B, SD) \land G(E, RB)$: $G(D, GP)$ is false. The implication is true. (Satisfied)
2. $G(B, RB) \implies G(M, DL) \land G(D, SD)$: $G(B, RB)$ is false. The implication is true. (Satisfied)

193,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

The two letters to initially find are F & S. The letter above the one which is between them is G.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, I can certainly solve this for you. I will first construct the 5x5 letter square according to your specifications, and then I will carefully break down your question step by step to find the answer.

Step 1: Construct the 5x5 Letter Square
The alphabet contains 26 letters. Excluding Q leaves 25 letters. A 5x5 square has 25 cells. We will fill the square with the letters A through Z, excluding Q, in alphabetical order, starting with A in the upper-left corner and ending with Z in the lower-right corner. The sequence of letters is:
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The grid will look like this:
Row 1: A B C D E
Row 2: F G H I J
Row 3: K L M N O
Row 4: P R S T U
Row 5: V W X Y Z

A is in the upper-left corner (Row 1, Column 1).
Z is in the lower-right corner (Row 5, Column 5).
The letter Q is not used.

Step 2: Decipher the Question Step by Step

The question is: ""which letter comes just above the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B and the letter just before the letter just above Y?""

Let's break this down from the inside out:

1.  **""the letter just below B""**:
    In our grid, B is in Row 1, Column 2.
    The letter just below B is in Row 2, Column 2.
    Looking at the grid, the letter at (Row 2, Column 2) is G.

2.  **""the letter just before the letter just below B""**:
    This refers to the letter just before G. In the standard alphabet sequence used to fill the grid (and also immediately preceding G in the grid reading order), the letter just before G is F.
    The letter is F. (Position: Row 2, Column 1).

3.  **""the letter just above Y""**:
    In our grid, Y is in Row 5, Column 4.
    The letter just above Y is in Row 4, Column 4.
    Looking at the grid, the letter at (Row 4, Column 4) is T.

4.  **""the letter just before the letter just above Y""**:
    This refers to the letter just before T. In the standard alphabet sequence used to fill the grid (and also immediately preceding T in the grid reading order), the letter just before T is S.
    The letter is S. (Position: Row 4, Column 3).

5.  **""the letter which comes between the letter just before the letter just below B (F) and the letter just before the letter just above Y (S)""**:
    This asks for the letter that comes between F and S in the grid. ""Between"" here likely refers to the letter located sequentially in the middle of the sequence of letters from F to S as read from the grid (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
    Let's list the letters in the grid starting from F up to S:
    F, G, H, I, J (end of Row 2)
    K, L, M, N, O (Row 3)
    P, R, S (beginning of Row 4)
    The full sequence from F to S is: F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S.
    There are 13 letters in this sequence. The letter in the middle is the 7th letter.
    Counting: F(1), G(2), H(3), I(4), J(5), K(6), L(7), M(8), N(9), O(10), P(11), R(12), S(13).
    The 7th letter in this sequence is L.
    (Alternatively, the geometric midpoint of F's position (2,1) and S's position (4,3) is ((2+4)/2, (1+3)/2) = (3,2), which is the position of L).
    So, this letter is L. (Position: Row 3, Column 2).

6.  **""which letter comes just above the letter which comes between..."" (which is L)**:
    This asks for the letter just above L.
    L is in Row 3, Column 2.
    The letter just above L is in Row 2, Column 2.
    Looking at the grid, the letter at (Row 2, Column 2) is G.

Therefore, the letter that comes just above L is G.

9) There are boys in two corners.
10) Kevin occupies an even position, and is the only boy who borders a unique number of girls.",,"A) There are five boys prior to the median, meaning that there are three boys in each of the first two rows.  If the first boy is at location 4, then there could only be two boys in the first row.  The first boy must be located before position 4, therefore a girl must occupy: 28 (clue 7).  The second boy can not be at position 4 (clue 6).  The earliest position that the third boy could occupy is position 5.  Therefore, a girl must occupy: 4.
B) If boys are at positions 1 (a corner) and 25 (clue 7), then a boy would have to be at either position 7 or 22 (clue 9).  In either case, more than three boys would not be along the edge of the picture, violating clue 5.  Therefore, a girl must occupy: 1.  Boys must occupy: 7 and 22 (clue 9).  Girls must occupy: 6, 14, 15, and 23.
C) For three boys to be in the first row, the second boy must occupy: 5 (which also satisfies clue 6).  A girl must occupy 12.  Per clue 8, a boy must occupy: 13.  A girl must occupy: 20.  To avoid violating clue 5, boys must occupy: 8 and 21.  A girl must occupy: 9.

1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.

200,"Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?",,"Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the reasoning step-by-step:

1.  **Analyze the problem statement:** The problem describes a severe situation (torrential rain, flooding, destruction of crops) in a town called MADADIA. It then states that Phil's wife, Norma, is completely unconcerned about this situation (""could really care less""). The question asks for the reason behind Norma's lack of concern.
2.  **Identify key information and potential clues:** The story provides details about the severity of the rain and its effects. It also gives the name of the town: MADADIA. Norma's reaction (indifference) is central to the question.
3.  **Examine the unusual details:** The detailed description of the flood seems realistic, but the name of the town, MADADIA, is quite unusual.
4.  **Analyze the unusual detail:** Let's look closely at the name MADADIA. M-A-D-A-D-I-A. If we read it backwards, it is A-I-D-A-D-A-M. This is incorrect. Let's look again. M-A-D-A-D-I-A. The word reads the same forwards as backwards. It is a palindrome. M-A-D-A-D-I-A forwards is M-A-D-A-D-I-A backwards. (My initial quick check was wrong). Okay, confirmed, MADADIA is a palindrome.
5.  **Consider the significance of the unusual detail in a riddle context:** Palindromic names for places are extremely rare in the real world and are often used in puzzles or riddles as a deliberate linguistic feature that holds the key to the solution.
6.  **Connect the unusual detail to Norma's reaction:** Norma's complete indifference to a severe flood in her apparent home town is highly unusual if the situation were real. The most plausible explanation for her lack of concern, given the artificial nature suggested by the palindromic name, is that the situation itself is not real.
7.  **Formulate the conclusion:** The palindromic nature of the town's name, MADADIA, signals that the story is a fictional construct or a riddle. Therefore, the described rain and flood are not real events affecting Norma, which is why she doesn't care about them.

Final answer: Norma doesn't care about the rain in Madadia because the town's name, MADADIA, is a palindrome, which indicates that the story is a fictional construct or a riddle, and therefore the rain and flood are not real.",True

M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.

If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the three statements made by the Minister be $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
$S_1$: ""Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.""
$S_2$: ""Nothing is going down.""
$S_3$: ""Of course. Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.""

We are told that the Minister tells the truth exactly once in every three statements. This means that among $S_1, S_2, S_3$, exactly one statement is true and exactly two statements are false.

The announcement is either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies, or tax levels. There are $3 \times 2 = 6$ possible announcements:
1. Wages Up (WU)
2. Wages Down (WD)
3. Subsidies Up (SU)
4. Subsidies Down (SD)
5. Tax levels Up (TU)
6. Tax levels Down (TD)

Let's determine the truth value of each statement for each of the 6 possible announcements.
- $S_1$: ""It's about subsidies."" This statement is true if the announcement is about subsidies (SU or SD). It is false otherwise (WU, WD, TU, TD).
- $S_2$: ""Nothing is going down."" This statement is true if the announcement is not a decrease. It is true if the announcement is WU, SU, or TU. It is false if the announcement is a decrease (WD, SD, TD).
- $S_3$: ""Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase."" This is a logical OR statement. It is true if ""subsidies are going down"" is true (SD), or if ""there will be a wage increase"" is true (WU). It is false otherwise (SU, WD, TU, TD).

Now, let's list the truth values for $(S_1, S_2, S_3)$ for each possible announcement, and count how many are true. Let T denote True and F denote False.

1.  If the announcement is WU (Wages Up):
    $S_1$: Is it about subsidies? No. (F)
    $S_2$: Is nothing going down? Yes (Up). (T)
    $S_3$: Is it SD or WU? Yes (WU). (T)
    Truth values: (F, T, T). Number of true statements: 2. This contradicts the condition of exactly one true statement.

2.  If the announcement is WD (Wages Down):
    $S_1$: Is it about subsidies? No. (F)
    $S_2$: Is nothing going down? No (Down). (F)
    $S_3$: Is it SD or WU? No (neither). (F)
    Truth values: (F, F, F). Number of true statements: 0. This contradicts the condition.

3.  If the announcement is SU (Subsidies Up):
    $S_1$: Is it about subsidies? Yes. (T)
    $S_2$: Is nothing going down? Yes (Up). (T)
    $S_3$: Is it SD or WU? No (neither). (F)
    Truth values: (T, T, F). Number of true statements: 2. This contradicts the condition.

4.  If the announcement is SD (Subsidies Down):
    $S_1$: Is it about subsidies? Yes. (T)
    $S_2$: Is nothing going down? No (Down). (F)
    $S_3$: Is it SD or WU? Yes (SD). (T)
    Truth values: (T, F, T). Number of true statements: 2. This contradicts the condition.

5.  If the announcement is TU (Tax levels Up):
    $S_1$: Is it about subsidies? No. (F)
    $S_2$: Is nothing going down? Yes (Up). (T)
    $S_3$: Is it SD or WU? No (neither). (F)
    Truth values: (F, T, F). Number of true statements: 1. This matches the condition of exactly one true statement.

6.  If the announcement is TD (Tax levels Down):
    $S_1$: Is it about subsidies? No. (F)
    $S_2$: Is nothing going down? No (Down). (F)
    $S_3$: Is it SD or WU? No (neither). (F)
    Truth values: (F, F, F). Number of true statements: 0. This contradicts the condition.

Out of the six possible announcements, only the case where the announcement is Tax levels Up (TU) results in exactly one true statement ($S_2$ is true, $S_1$ and $S_3$ are false).

Since the Minister made these statements and the condition about his truth-telling must hold, the only possible announcement that could have been made is Tax levels Up.

Therefore, we can deduce the truth, which is the nature of the announcement.

The truth is that tax levels are going up.

Final answer: The truth is that tax levels are going up.",True
203,There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?,"By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"This is a game theory problem, specifically a type of impartial game called a subtraction game. In this game, the state is defined by the number of eggs, and a move consists of reducing the number of eggs by an amount between 1 and 100. The player who takes the last egg wins.

In impartial games under the normal play convention (last player to move wins), positions are classified as P-positions (previous player winning) or N-positions (next player winning). A position is a P-position if every move from it leads to an N-position. A position is an N-position if there is at least one move from it that leads to a P-position. The game ends when the number of eggs is 0. Since the player who takes the last egg wins, the player who is faced with 0 eggs has no move and loses. Thus, 0 is a P-position.

Let $N$ be the total number of eggs and $M$ be the maximum number of eggs that can be taken in a turn. In this problem, $N=2008$ and $M=100$. A player can take $x$ eggs, where $1 \le x \le M$.

The strategy for this type of game is based on leaving the opponent in a P-position. The P-positions in a subtraction game with maximum subtraction $M$ are the multiples of $M+1$.

Let's verify this.
- 0 is a multiple of $M+1$ ($0 = 0 \times (M+1)$) and is a P-position.
- Consider a number of eggs $n$ such that $n$ is a multiple of $M+1$. $n = k(M+1)$ for some integer $k \ge 1$. If a player is faced with $n$ eggs, they must take $x$ eggs where $1 \le x \le M$. The remaining number of eggs is $n-x = k(M+1)-x$. Since $1 \le x \le M$, we have $k(M+1)-M \le n-x \le k(M+1)-1$.
$k(M+1)-M = k(M+1) - (M+1) + 1 = (k-1)(M+1) + 1$.
So the number of eggs remaining is between $(k-1)(M+1) + 1$ and $k(M+1)-1$.
A number $y$ is a multiple of $M+1$ if $y \equiv 0 \pmod{M+1}$.
The remaining number $n-x = k(M+1)-x$. Since $1 \le x \le M$, $x \not\equiv 0 \pmod{M+1}$.
$k(M+1) \equiv 0 \pmod{M+1}$.
$k(M+1)-x \equiv -x \pmod{M+1}$. Since $1 \le x \le M$, $-x$ cannot be a multiple of $M+1$. So $k(M+1)-x$ is not a multiple of $M+1$.
Thus, any move from a multiple of $M+1$ leads to a position that is not a multiple of $M+1$. These positions are N-positions (as shown below). Therefore, any multiple of $M+1$ is a P-position.

- Consider a number of eggs $n$ such that $n$ is not a multiple of $M+1$. So $n = q(M+1) + r$, where $1 \le r \le M$. If a player is faced with $n$ eggs, they can take $x$ eggs such that $n-x$ is a multiple of $M+1$.
We want $n-x = j(M+1)$ for some integer $j$.
$q(M+1) + r - x = j(M+1)$.
$r - x = (j-q)(M+1)$.
We are looking for a move $x$ such that $1 \le x \le M$.
If we choose $x=r$, then $r-x = r-r = 0 = 0 \times (M+1)$. This is a multiple of $M+1$.
Since $n = q(M+1)+r$ with $1 \le r \le M$, the remainder $r = n \pmod{M+1}$ (assuming $n$ is not a multiple of $M+1$).
The number of eggs to take is $x = n \pmod{M+1}$.
Since $1 \le r \le M$, this value $x=r$ is between 1 and $M$, so taking $r$ eggs is a valid move.
Taking $r$ eggs leaves $n-r = q(M+1)$, which is a multiple of $M+1$ (a P-position).
Thus, from any position that is not a multiple of $M+1$, there is a move to a multiple of $M+1$. Therefore, any non-multiple of $M+1$ is an N-position.

Summary of positions:
- P-positions: Multiples of $M+1$.
- N-positions: Non-multiples of $M+1$.

The first player to move wins if and only if the initial position is an N-position. The winning strategy is to always move to a P-position.

The initial number of eggs is $N=2008$. The maximum number of eggs to take is $M=100$. So $M+1=101$.
We need to determine if $N=2008$ is a multiple of $M+1=101$.
We perform the division: $2008 \div 101$.
$2008 = q \times 101 + r$.
$2008 = 19 \times 101 + 89$.
$19 \times 101 = 1919$.
$2008 - 1919 = 89$.
So, $2008 = 19 \times 101 + 89$. The remainder is $r=89$.

Since the remainder is 89 (which is not 0), 2008 is not a multiple of 101.
Therefore, 2008 is an N-position, and the first player (you) has a winning strategy.

To win, you must move to a P-position, which is a multiple of 101.
The current number of eggs is 2008. You must take $x$ eggs such that $2008-x$ is a multiple of 101, and $1 \le x \le 100$.
$2008-x = k \times 101$ for some integer $k$.
We know $2008 = 19 \times 101 + 89$.
So, $19 \times 101 + 89 - x = k \times 101$.
$89 - x = (k-19) \times 101$.
Let $j = k-19$. $89 - x = j \times 101$.
We need to find the value of $x$ such that $1 \le x \le 100$.
$x = 89 - j \times 101$.
Since $1 \le x \le 100$:
$1 \le 89 - j \times 101 \le 100$.
Subtract 89 from all parts:
$1 - 89 \le -j \times 101 \le 100 - 89$.
$-88 \le -j \times 101 \le 11$.
Multiply by -1 and reverse the inequality signs:
$-11 \le j \times 101 \le 88$.
The only integer $j$ for which $j \times 101$ is in the interval $[-11, 88]$ is $j=0$.
If $j=0$, then $89 - x = 0 \times 101 = 0$, which means $x=89$.
This value $x=89$ satisfies the condition $1 \le x \le 100$.

If you take 89 eggs initially, the number of eggs remaining is $2008 - 89 = 1919$.
$1919 = 19 \times 101$, which is a multiple of 101 (a P-position).
Now, it is the opponent's turn with 1919 eggs. No matter how many eggs the opponent takes (between 1 and 100), they will leave a number of eggs that is not a multiple of 101.
For example, if the opponent takes $y$ eggs ($1 \le y \le 100$), the number of eggs becomes $1919-y$. $1919-y = 19 \times 101 - y$. Since $1 \le y \le 100$, $y$ is not a multiple of 101. Thus $19 \times 101 - y$ is not a multiple of 101.
When it is your turn again, you will be faced with a number of eggs $n'$ that is not a multiple of 101. You can write $n' = q' \times 101 + r'$, where $1 \le r' \le 100$. You take $r'$ eggs, leaving $q' \times 101$ eggs for your opponent. This is a valid move as $1 \le r' \le 100$.
This strategy guarantees that you always leave your opponent with a multiple of 101 eggs. Since the number of eggs decreases with each turn, eventually your opponent will be faced with 101 eggs ($1 \times 101$). Your opponent must take $y$ eggs, $1 \le y \le 100$. They will leave $101-y$ eggs, where $1 \le 101-y \le 100$. It will be your turn, and the number of eggs will be between 1 and 100. You can take all the remaining eggs (since the number is within the allowed range of 1 to 100), leaving 0 eggs. By taking the last eggs, you win.

Thus, to guarantee a win, you must take 89 eggs initially.

We have a 3x5 grid of letters, with the last letter of the third row missing. We need to find the pattern that relates the letters in the rows and columns.

1.  **Convert Letters to Numerical Values:** A common approach to letter puzzles is to convert each letter to its position in the standard English alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26).

    The given grid of letters is:
    O Q L H R
    I J F E Q
    F G F C ?

    Converting these letters to their numerical values:
    O = 15, Q = 17, L = 12, H = 8, R = 18
    I = 9, J = 10, F = 6, E = 5, Q = 17
    F = 6, G = 7, F = 6, C = 3, ? = ?

    9  10 6  5  17
    6  7  6  3  ?

2.  **Look for Relationships between Rows/Columns:** Let's examine the columns to see if there's a mathematical relationship between the numbers in the first two rows and the number in the third row.

    *   **Column 1:**
        Row 1: 15
        Row 2: 9
        Row 3: 6

        Row 2: 10
        Row 3: 7
        Is there a relationship between 17, 10, and 7? Notice that 17 - 10 = 7. This fits the same pattern as Column 1.

    *   **Column 3:**
        Row 1: 12
        Row 2: 6
        Row 3: 6
        Is there a relationship between 12, 6, and 6? Notice that 12 - 6 = 6. This also fits the same pattern.

        Row 2: 5
        Row 3: 3
        Is there a relationship between 8, 5, and 3? Notice that 8 - 5 = 3. This pattern holds true for all the given columns.

3.  **Formulate the Rule:** The pattern appears to be that the numerical value of the letter in the third row of a column is equal to the numerical value of the letter in the first row of that column minus the numerical value of the letter in the second row of that column.
    Rule: Value(Row 3, Col N) = Value(Row 1, Col N) - Value(Row 2, Col N)

4.  **Apply the Rule to the Missing Letter:** The missing letter is in Column 5.
    *   Value(Row 1, Column 5) = Value of R = 18
    *   Value(Row 2, Column 5) = Value of Q = 17
    *   Value(Row 3, Column 5) = Value(Row 1, Column 5) - Value(Row 2, Column 5)
    *   Value(Row 3, Column 5) = 18 - 17
    *   Value(Row 3, Column 5) = 1

5.  **Convert the Numerical Result back to a Letter:** The number 1 corresponds to the letter A in the alphabet.

Therefore, the missing letter is A.

Let's verify the full numerical grid based on this rule:
Row 1: 15 17 12 8 18
Row 2: 9  10 6  5  17
Row 3: (15-9) (17-10) (12-6) (8-5) (18-17)
Row 3: 6  7  6  3  1

Converting the third row back to letters:
6 = F
7 = G
6 = F
3 = C
1 = A

This matches the given third row (F G F C ?) and provides A as the missing letter.

Final answer: A",True
206,"It is a sunny and warm spring day in Cipher, South Decoder. Fans at the baseball park have come to see their own Cipher Solvers play their rivals, the Rockford Peaches, in the first game of the season. Everyone is hoping for a good show.
The home fans became very vocal as 5 of their players (Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, and Jimmy Blake) either made an exciting play to allow runs to score, or made an embarrassing error - or both!

Names: Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, Jimmy Blake
Positions: pitcher, catcher, 3rd base, shortstop, left field
RBIs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Errors: 0, 1, ?, 2, 3
First Inning
By the end of the game, two players were charged with the same number of errors, either 1 or 2. This number (?) is to be deduced from the clues.
Second Inning
No player ended up with the same number of errors and RBIs.
Third Inning
The left fielder had his 1 RBI when, with runners at 1st and 3rd, he hit one over the head of the Peaches' 2nd baseman and into right field.
Fourth Inning
Jimmy Blake earned his 2 RBIs when he hit a triple, allowing the center fielder and the 3rd baseman to score.
Fifth Inning
Flynn had his 1 error when he missed a throw to 1st base.
Sixth Inning
Tim, who posted either 2 or 3 RBIs, ended up with 1 error more than the pitcher after he (Tim) quite literally dropped the ball.
Seventh Inning
The player who finished with no RBIs and 2 errors, including fumbling a fly ball, doesn't play 3rd base.
Eighth Inning
The player who had his 3 RBIs with a game-tying in-the-park home run that had the fans on their feet, scored at least 1 error, but he had fewer errors than the shortstop.
Ninth Inning
K.C. ended the game with 2 fewer errors than the catcher, who let a wild pitch get past him so that the Peaches regained the lead.
Can you determine which position the boys played, as well as how many runs batted in (RBI) and errors they made?",,"Hank (catcher) with 0 RBIs and 2 errors
K.C. (left field) with 1 RBI and 0 errors
Jimmy Blake (shortstop) with 2 RBIs and 3 errors
Tim (3rd base) with 3 RBIs and 2 errors
Flynn (pitcher) with 4 RBIs and 1 error",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:

1.  **Identify the Players, Positions, RBIs, and Errors:**
    *   Players: Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, Jimmy Blake.
    *   Positions: pitcher, catcher, 3rd base, shortstop, left field. (Each player has one unique position).
    *   RBIs: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. (Each player has one unique RBI value, based on clues like ""his 1 RBI"", ""his 2 RBIs"", etc.).
    *   Errors: {0, 1, ?, 2, 3}. (Based on the first inning clue, two players have the same number of errors, which is either 1 or 2. Let this value be X. The set of error values for the five players is {0, 1, X, 2, 3}, where X is 1 or 2, and appears twice. The distinct possible error values are {0, 1, 2, 3}).

2.  **Process Direct Clues:**
    *   Fifth Inning: Flynn had his 1 error. Errors(Flynn) = 1.
    *   Fourth Inning: Jimmy Blake earned his 2 RBIs. RBI(Jimmy Blake) = 2.
    *   Third Inning: The left fielder had his 1 RBI. RBI(left field) = 1.

3.  **Use Unique RBI Values:**
    *   RBIs are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
    *   Jimmy Blake has 2 RBIs.
    *   Sixth Inning: Tim posted either 2 or 3 RBIs. Since Jimmy Blake has 2, Tim must have 3 RBIs. RBI(Tim) = 3.
    *   So far: RBI(Jimmy Blake)=2, RBI(Tim)=3.
    *   Remaining RBIs to assign are {0, 1, 4} for Hank, K.C., and Flynn.
    *   From step 2, RBI(left field) = 1. So one of Hank, K.C., or Flynn has 1 RBI and plays left field.

4.  **Use Second Inning Constraint (RBI != Errors):**
    *   For any player P, RBI(P) != Errors(P).
    *   Flynn has 1 error. Errors(Flynn) = 1. Therefore, RBI(Flynn) != 1.
    *   Flynn is one of the players with remaining RBIs {0, 1, 4}. Since RBI(Flynn) cannot be 1, RBI(Flynn) must be 0 or 4.

5.  **Use Seventh Inning Clue (0 RBI, 2 Errors Player):**
    *   Let P0 be the player with 0 RBIs and 2 errors. RBI(P0) = 0, Errors(P0) = 2.
    *   P0 doesn't play 3rd base. Position(P0) != 3rd base.
    *   P0 must be one of the players with remaining RBIs {0, 1, 4}, i.e., Hank, K.C., or Flynn.
    *   If Flynn was P0, RBI(Flynn)=0 and Errors(Flynn)=2. But Errors(Flynn) is 1. Contradiction. So Flynn is not P0.
    *   Therefore, P0 is either Hank or K.C. So either Hank or K.C. has RBI=0 and Errors=2.

6.  **Determine Flynn's RBI:**
    *   Flynn's RBI is 0 or 4 (from step 4).
    *   If RBI(Flynn) = 0, then Flynn would be P0, but we showed this is impossible (step 5).
    *   So, RBI(Flynn) must be 4. RBI(Flynn) = 4.

7.  **Refined RBI and Player Assignments:**
    *   Tim: RBI=3
    *   Jimmy Blake: RBI=2
    *   Flynn: RBI=4, Errors=1
    *   Remaining RBIs {0, 1} belong to Hank and K.C.
    *   One of Hank or K.C. is P0 (RBI=0, Errors=2, not 3B).
    *   The other of Hank or K.C. has RBI=1 and is the left fielder (RBI(left field)=1).

8.  **Use Ninth Inning Clue (K.C. and Catcher Errors):**
    *   Errors(K.C.) = Errors(catcher) - 2.
    *   Let EKC = Errors(K.C.) and EC = Errors(catcher). EKC = EC - 2.
    *   Possible error values for any player are from {0, 1, 2, 3}.
    *   Possible pairs (EKC, EC) satisfying EC - EKC = 2 from {0, 1, 2, 3}: (0, 2) and (1, 3).
    *   So (Errors(K.C.), Errors(catcher)) is either (0, 2) or (1, 3).

9.  **Consider Cases for P0 (Hank or K.C.):**
    *   Case 1: K.C. is P0. RBI(K.C.)=0, Errors(K.C.)=2. Pos(K.C.) != 3rd base.
        *   If Errors(K.C.)=2, then from Errors(K.C.) = Errors(catcher) - 2, we get 2 = Errors(catcher) - 2, so Errors(catcher) = 4.
        *   An error value of 4 is not possible in the set {0, 1, X, 2, 3}. This case leads to a contradiction. K.C. is not P0.
    *   Case 2: Hank is P0. RBI(Hank)=0, Errors(Hank)=2. Pos(Hank) != 3rd base.
        *   Then K.C. must have the remaining RBI {1} and be the left fielder. RBI(K.C.)=1, Position(K.C.)=left field.
        *   Errors(K.C.) != RBI(K.C.) (Constraint 2), so Errors(K.C.) != 1",True

Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"This is a clever riddle that relies on historical context. Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Analyze the seemingly contradictory information:**
    *   They lived on the *same road* their *whole life*.
    *   They were contemporaries, born in consecutive years (1309, 1310, 1311), and lived for over 60 years, meaning they were alive at the same time for decades.
    *   They had ""full active lives,"" implying they weren't shut-ins but moved around.
    *   Yet, they *never crossed paths*.

2.  **Identify the setting:** The key piece of information is ""old Jerusalem.""

3.  **Recall historical facts about old Jerusalem:** Old Jerusalem was historically divided into distinct Quarters based on religious and ethnic groups: the Christian Quarter, the Jewish Quarter, the Muslim Quarter, and the Armenian Quarter. Life within these quarters was often quite segregated, with people primarily living, working, and socializing within their own community.

4.  **Apply the historical context to the problem:** Consider a road that runs through more than one of these distinct Quarters.

5.  **Formulate the hypothesis:** What if Adam, Ben, and Cyril lived on the *same road*, but in *different Quarters* along that road? For example, Adam lived on Street X in the Christian Quarter, Ben lived on Street X in the Jewish Quarter, and Cyril lived on Street X in the Muslim Quarter.

6.  **Test the hypothesis against the conditions:**
    *   They are on the ""same road"" (Street X). Check.
    *   They lived there their whole life. Check.
    *   They were contemporaries for decades. Check.
    *   They had full active lives. This means they were active *within their own Quarter* or ventured out into specific common areas (like markets or major religious sites), but it does not *require* them to traverse the entire length of ""their"" road into other Quarters, especially if most of their daily needs and social circle were within their own community.
    *   They never crossed paths. If they lived in different Quarters along the same road and their active lives primarily kept them within their respective, segregated communities along that road, it is entirely plausible that they would never physically encounter each other on that road, or anywhere else, if their activities were largely confined to their own Quarter and specific areas frequented by their group.

7.  **Conclusion:** The most logical explanation is that the road passed through different Quarters of old Jerusalem, and Adam, Ben, and Cyril each lived in a different one of these Quarters. Their ""full active lives"" were likely spent predominantly within their respective, segregated communities along that road, preventing them from crossing paths with someone from a different Quarter on the same road.

The crucial piece of information is that ""all four words in the ratio are somehow related"". The note also states there is more than one possible answer.

Let's analyze the relationship between the two given words: ""runway"" and ""cinema"".

1.  **Runway:** This word can refer to an airport runway (for aircraft take-off/landing) or a fashion runway (for models displaying clothes). Given the pairing with ""cinema"", the fashion runway sense seems more likely, as both are venues for public visual presentation or performance.
2.  **Cinema:** This is a venue where films are shown to an audience. It's a place for a public visual presentation or performance (a film screening).

Let's explore the relationship between ""fashion runway"" and ""cinema"":
-   Both are **venues** (places).
-   Both host **public events** or **presentations**.
-   Both presentations are primarily **visual**.
-   Both presentations typically involve watching something **moving** (models walking, images on screen).
-   Both are related to **performance** or **display**.

Let's consider the structure of a word analogy: A : B :: C : D. The relationship between A and B is intended to be similar to the relationship between C and D. We need to find a word that could be C or D, such that all four words (runway, cinema, C, D) are somehow related.

Based on the identified relationships, let's propose the relationship R as: ""Venue for visual presentation/performance involving movement"".
-   Runway is a venue for fashion shows (visual presentation, models moving).
-   Cinema is a venue for film screenings (visual presentation, images moving).

Now we need to find a pair of words (C, D) that share a similar relationship, and where all four words (runway, cinema, C, D) are related. Let C and D also be venues for visual presentation/performance involving movement.

Possible venues for visual presentation/performance involving movement:
-   Theatre (plays, performances with actors moving)
-   Stage (performances with people moving - often part of a theatre or concert hall)
-   Stadium (sports events with players moving)
-   Arena (sports events, concerts, etc. with participants moving)
-   Race track (races with vehicles or runners moving)

Let's test some pairs (C, D) to see if they fit the relationship R (""Venue for visual presentation/performance involving movement"") and if all four words are related venues.

    -   Theatre: Venue for watching actors move.
    -   Stadium: Venue for watching players move.
    -   Relationship R(Theatre, Stadium): Yes, both are venues for watching movement.
    -   Are Runway, Cinema, Theatre, Stadium related? Yes, they are all types of public venues for performances or events. This is a valid ratio: Runway : Cinema :: Theatre : Stadium.

John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:

218,"Nick has always wanted one, so he goes out and buys a brand new one for £5000.  Unfortunately the next day he breaks it, so he goes out again and gets another brand new one. This time however, it only costs him £25. The next day someone offers to buy it off of him for £6000.
What is it ?",,A personalised number plate.,GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"This is a classic riddle. Let's break down the clues:

1.  **""Nick has always wanted one""**: It's something desirable.
2.  **""buys a brand new one for £5000""**: It can be expensive initially.
3.  **""Unfortunately the next day he breaks it""**: It is fragile or prone to failure. ""Breaks it"" implies some kind of damage or cessation of function.
4.  **""so he goes out again and gets another brand new one""**: It can be replaced.
5.  **""This time however, it only costs him £25""**: A replacement can be acquired much, much cheaper. This suggests the initial high price was for perceived value or potential, while the cheaper price is for something with little perceived value.
6.  **""The next day someone offers to buy it off of him for £6000""**: The cheap replacement suddenly becomes very valuable.

Let's consider what kind of thing fits this pattern:
*   It is something desirable that can be acquired (bought or gotten).
*   Its initial acquisition can be costly (£5000).
*   It can fail or be rendered useless/worthless quickly (""breaks it"").
*   A replacement can be acquired very cheaply (£25). This cheap replacement likely has little perceived value or potential at the time of acquisition.
*   This cheap replacement can unexpectedly become highly valuable (£6000) very quickly.

This sequence of events, particularly the dramatic increase in value for the very cheap second one, strongly suggests something whose value is tied to unpredictable performance or discovery of hidden potential, often in a competitive context. The ""breaks it"" part suggests either physical fragility or failure to perform.

Let's consider an animal acquired for competition, such as a racehorse or a show dog.
*   **Racehorse:** Nick always wanted a racehorse. He buys a promising one for £5000. The next day, it breaks its leg or suffers a career-ending injury (""breaks it""). He buys another horse, perhaps an old or unwanted one, for a pittance (£25). The next day, this cheap horse unexpectedly wins a race or shows incredible speed/potential, leading to an offer of £6000. This fits all the criteria perfectly. ""Brand new"" can be interpreted as ""newly acquired"" or referring to a young, untested animal.

Other possibilities might include:
*   **Show Dog:** Similar scenario to a racehorse.
*   **Competition Pigeon:** High-value birds can be expensive, they can fail to return (""breaks it""), cheap birds can be bought, and one might unexpectedly win a major race.
*   **A Share in a Competitive Animal/Venture:** Buying a £5000 share, the venture fails, buying a £25 share in a different venture, that venture succeeds wildly.

However, the language ""buys a brand new one"" and ""gets another brand new one"" followed by ""someone offers to buy it off of him"" points most directly to the acquisition of an entity itself rather than just a share, and the physical nature implied by ""breaks it"" fits an animal well.

Among these possibilities, a racehorse is perhaps the most widely recognized context where these dramatic financial swings occur. The £25 price tag could represent acquiring a horse for meat price, rescue fee, or a minimal fee to take it off someone's hands, and £6000 is a plausible (though perhaps still modest) offer after a surprising victory for such a cheap acquisition.

The final answer is $\boxed{A racehorse}$.",True

In this scenario, Kate would have lost 15 times ($15) and won 4 times ($8), for a net loss of $7.  Since she now has $20, she must have started with $27.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1.  **Determine the betting period:**
    The betting starts on Monday, March 3rd. March has 31 days. To find the number of weekdays from March 3rd to March 31st, we can count them. Assuming a standard year where March 1st is a Saturday (consistent with March 3rd being a Monday):
    *   Week of March 3rd: Mon 3, Tue 4, Wed 5, Thu 6, Fri 7 (5 days)
    *   Week of March 10th: Mon 10, Tue 11, Wed 12, Thu 13, Fri 14 (5 days)
    *   Week of March 17th: Mon 17, Tue 18, Wed 19, Thu 20, Fri 21 (5 days)
    *   Week of March 24th: Mon 24, Tue 25, Wed 26, Thu 27, Fri 28 (5 days)
    *   Week of March 31st: Mon 31 (1 day)
    Total number of betting days = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 21 days.

2.  **Calculate the total money bet and the daily pool:**
    Each of the 3 people bets $1 each day.
    Total amount bet by each person over the month = $1/day * 21 days = $21.
    The daily pool = $1 (Kevin) + $1 (Kate) + $1 (Kathy) = $3.

3.  **Analyze the winnings:**
    Let K_w be the number of times Kevin won.
    Let Ka_w be the number of times Kate won.
    Let Ky_w be the number of times Kathy won.
    We are given:
    *   Kathy won twice as many times as Kevin: Ky_w = 2 * K_w
    *   Kevin was right once more than Kate: K_w = Ka_w + 1, which means Ka_w = K_w - 1.
    Since the number of wins must be a non-negative integer, Ka_w >= 0, so K_w - 1 >= 0, meaning K_w >= 1.

4.  **Determine the relationship between wins and no-win days:**
    On any given day, the boss eats a specific number of doughnuts. Since Kevin bet on 2, Kate on 3, and Kathy on 3.5, at most one person can win on any given day (you can't eat exactly 2 and 3 doughnuts at the same time).
    Let N_w be the number of days where no one won.
    The total number of betting days is the sum of days each person won (they are mutually exclusive) and the days no one won:
    K_w + Ka_w + Ky_w + N_w = 21
    Substitute the relationships for Ka_w and Ky_w:
    K_w + (K_w - 1) + (2 * K_w) + N_w = 21
    4 * K_w - 1 + N_w = 21
    4 * K_w + N_w = 22
    Since N_w must be non-negative (N_w >= 0), we have 4 * K_w <= 22, so K_w <= 22/4 = 5.5.
    Since K_w must be an integer and K_w >= 1, the possible values for K_w are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

221,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.
Morris the Daft:
A) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.
B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.
Robby O'Mental:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.
Considering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?",,"Robby left the door open.
The one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.
There are only 3 truthful statements.
If Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.
If Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.
If Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.
In Robby's case, in detail:
Norris A True
B False
Nobby A True
B False
Morris A False
B True
Dave A False
B False (why did he bother to leave the
cell door open?)",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the four guards be Norris McDim (N), Nobby Shifty (No), Morris the Daft (M), and Robby O'Mental (R).
Let G be the guard who was on duty that evening and who left the cell door open. The problem states that exactly one guard was on duty and left the door open. So G is one of N, No, M, or R.

The statements made by the guards are:
Norris McDim (N):
N1: ""I did not leave the door open."" (Norris is not G)
N2: ""Morris was the one who did it."" (Morris is G)

Nobby Shifty (No):
No1: ""I was not the one who was on duty that evening."" (Nobby is not G)
No2: ""Norris was on duty."" (Norris is G)

Morris the Daft (M):
M1: ""Nobby was the one on duty that evening."" (Nobby is G)
M2: ""I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.""

Robby O'Mental (R):
R1: ""I did not leave the door open."" (Robby is not G)
R2: ""I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.""

We are given that in total, three statements are true and five statements are false out of the eight statements made.

Let's analyze the statements.
M2 says ""I (Morris) hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape."" The problem states, ""All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape."" This implies that Morris hoped Torks would escape. So, statement M2 is TRUE.

Now we know that M2 is True. Since there are 3 true statements in total, the remaining 7 statements (N1, N2, No1, No2, M1, R1, R2) must contain exactly 3 - 1 = 2 true statements and 5 false statements.

Let t(S) denote the truth value of a statement S (1 if True, 0 if False).
We know t(M2) = 1.
The condition is that the sum of the truth values of all 8 statements is 3.
t(N1) + t(N2) + t(No1) + t(No2) + t(M1) + t(M2) + t(R1) + t(R2) = 3.
t(N1) + t(N2) + t(No1) + t(No2) + t(M1) + 1 + t(R1) + t(R2) = 3.
t(N1) + t(N2) + t(No1) + t(No2) + t(M1) + t(R1) + t(R2) = 2.

Statements N1, N2, No1, No2, M1, R1 are claims about the identity of G (the guard on duty). Let's express their truth values based on who G is:
t(N1) = 1 if G is not N, 0 if G is N. (G != N)
t(N2) = 1 if G is M, 0 if G is not M. (G == M)
t(No1) = 1 if G is not No, 0 if G is No. (G != No)
t(No2) = 1 if G is N, 0 if G is not N. (G == N)
t(M1) = 1 if G is No, 0 if G is not No. (G == No)
t(R1) = 1 if G is not R, 0 if G is R. (G != R)

Statement R2 is about Robby's surprise: t(R2) is 1 if Robby was not surprised, 0 if Robby was surprised.

We can test each possibility for G:

Case 1: Norris (N) was on duty (G = N).
t(N1) = (N != N) = 0
t(N2) = (N == M) = 0
t(No1) = (N != No) = 1
t(No2) = (N == N) = 1
t(M1) = (N == No) = 0
t(R1) = (N != R) = 1
Sum of these 6 truth values = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.
From the equation t(N1) + ... + t(R1) + t(R2) = 2, we have 3 + t(R2) = 2, which means t(R2) = -1. This is impossible for a truth value. So G cannot be Norris.

Case 2: Nobby (No) was on duty (G = No).
t(N1) = (No != N) = 1
t(N2) = (No == M) = 0
t(No1) = (No != No) = 0
t(No2) = (No == N) = 0
t(M1) = (No == No) = 1
t(R1) = (No != R) = 1
Sum of these 6 truth values = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3.
From the equation t(N1) + ... + t(R1) + t(R2) = 2, we have 3 + t(R2) = 2, which means t(R2) = -1. Impossible. So G cannot be Nobby.

Case 3: Morris (M) was on duty (G = M).
t(N1) = (M != N) = 1
t(N2) = (M == M) = 1
t(No1) = (M != No) = 1
t(No2) = (M == N) = 0
t(M1) = (M == No) = 0
t(R1) = (M != R) = 1
Sum of these 6 truth values = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4.
From the equation t(N1) + ... + t(R1) + t(R2) = 2, we have 4 + t(R2) = 2, which means t(R2) = -2. Impossible. So G cannot be Morris.

Case 4: Robby (R) was on duty (G = R).
t(N1) = (R != N) = 1
t(N2) = (R == M) = 0
t(No1) = (R != No) = 1
t(No2) = (R == N) = 0
t(M1) = (R == No) = 0
t(R1) = (R != R) = 0
Sum of these 6 truth values = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.
From the equation t(N1) + ... + t(R1) + t(R2) = 2, we have 2 + t(R2) = 2, which means t(R2) = 0. This is a valid truth value.

So, the only possibility is that G = R (Robby was on duty) and t(R2) = 0 (Robby's statement R2 is False).

Let's verify this solution by listing the truth values of all 8 statements when G = R and R2 is False:
N1: ""I (Norris) did not leave the door open."" (Norris is not G=R). True.
N2: ""Morris was the one who did it."" (Morris is G=R). False.
No1: ""I (Nobby) was not the one who was on duty that evening."" (Nobby is not G=R). True.
No2: ""Norris was on duty."" (Norris is G=R). False.
M1: ""Nobby was the one on duty that evening."" (Nobby is G=R). False.
M2: ""I (Morris) hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape."" True (as established from the problem context).
R1: ""I (Robby) did not leave the door open."" (Robby is not G=R). False.
R2: ""I (Robby) was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape."" False (as deduced).

Let's count the true and false statements:
True statements: N1, No1, M2 (3 true statements)
False statements: N2, No2, M1, R1, R2 (5 false statements)

This perfectly matches the condition that there are three true and five false statements in total.
The guard who was on duty and left the door open is G. Our analysis shows that G = Robby O'Mental.
The problem asks which guard is guilty. The guilty guard is the one who committed the ""serious matter"" of leaving the cell door open. This was the guard on duty.

Therefore, Robby O'Mental is the guilty guard.

The final answer is $\boxed{Robby O'Mental}$.",True
222,"John, Pete, Tom, George, and Steve are brothers. One day, one of them broke a window. When their father asked them who did it, they gave the following answers:
John: ""It was Pete or Tom.""
Pete: ""It was neither George nor me.""
Tom: ""Both of you are lying.""
Steve: ""No, only one of them is lying.""
George: ""No, Steve, you are wrong.""
Then their mother added: ""Three of my sons are telling the truth, but I do not believe what the two others said.""
Who broke the window?","If you find it difficult to use logic alone, then use trial and error by assuming each one of the five sons broke the window, and list whether they are telling a lie or the truth.","By assuming that each of the five brothers broke the window and seeing how many told the truth, only Tom can be the person who broke the window.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let $S_J, S_P, S_T, S_S, S_G$ be the statements made by John, Pete, Tom, Steve, and George, respectively. Let B be the brother who broke the window.

The statements can be translated into propositions about B:
$S_J$: ""It was Pete or Tom."" This means $B=P$ or $B=T$.
$S_P$: ""It was neither George nor me (Pete)."" This means $B \neq G$ and $B \neq P$. This is equivalent to $B \in \{J, T, S\}$.
$S_T$: ""Both of you (John and Pete) are lying."" This means $S_J$ is false and $S_P$ is false. Logically, $S_T \equiv \neg S_J \land \neg S_P$.
$S_S$: ""No, only one of them (John and Pete) is lying."" This means exactly one of $S_J$ and $S_P$ is false. This is the logical XOR of $S_J$ and $S_P$, i.e., $S_S \equiv (S_J \land \neg S_P) \lor (\neg S_J \land S_P)$.
$S_G$: ""No, Steve, you are wrong."" This means $S_S$ is false. $S_G \equiv \neg S_S$.

Let $V_X$ be the truth value of statement $S_X$ ($V_X=1$ if true, $V_X=0$ if false).
The mother's statement is that exactly three of her sons are telling the truth.
So, $V_J + V_P + V_T + V_S + V_G = 3$.

From $S_G \equiv \neg S_S$, we know that $V_G = \neg V_S$. This means $V_G$ and $V_S$ must have opposite truth values. Thus, exactly one of $S_G$ and $S_S$ is true, and the other is false. So, $V_S + V_G = 1$.

Substituting this into the sum of truth values from the mother's statement:
$V_J + V_P + V_T + (V_S + V_G) = 3$
$V_J + V_P + V_T + 1 = 3$
$V_J + V_P + V_T = 2$.
This means that among John, Pete, and Tom's statements, exactly two are true and one is false.

Now let's analyze Tom's statement, $S_T$: $S_T \equiv \neg S_J \land \neg S_P$.
The truth value $V_T$ is 1 if and only if $V_J=0$ and $V_P=0$.
If $V_T=1$, then $V_J=0$ and $V_P=0$. In this case, $V_J + V_P + V_T = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1$.
However, we deduced that $V_J + V_P + V_T = 2$.
This is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption $V_T=1$ must be false.
So, $V_T=0$.

Now substitute $V_T=0$ back into $V_J + V_P + V_T = 2$:
$V_J + V_P + 0 = 2$
$V_J + V_P = 2$.
Since truth values can only be 0 or 1, the only way for their sum to be 2 is if both $V_J=1$ and $V_P=1$.

So, we have determined the truth values for John's, Pete's, and Tom's statements:
$S_J$ is true ($V_J=1$).
$S_P$ is true ($V_P=1$).
$S_T$ is false ($V_T=0$).

Now let's use the truth of $S_J$ and $S_P$ to find out who broke the window B.
$S_J$ is true means $B=P$ or $B=T$. So $B \in \{P, T\}$.
$S_P$ is true means $B \neq G$ and $B \neq P$. So $B \in \{J, T, S\}$.

For both statements to be true, B must be in the intersection of the possibilities from $S_J$ and $S_P$.
$B \in \{P, T\} \cap \{J, T, S\}$.
The intersection of these two sets is $\{T\}$.
Thus, based on the truth of $S_J$ and $S_P$, Tom must have broken the window (B=T).

Let's verify if $B=T$ is consistent with the truth values of all statements and the mother's condition.
If B=T:
$S_J$: ""Pete or Tom."" Is $T=P$ or $T=T$? Yes, $T=T$ is true. $V_J=1$. (Consistent)
$S_P$: ""Neither George nor Pete."" Is $T \neq G$ and $T \neq P$? Yes, true. $V_P=1$. (Consistent)
$S_T$: ""John and Pete are lying."" $S_J$ is true and $S_P$ is true, so this statement is false. $V_T=0$. (Consistent)
$S_S$: ""Only one of John, Pete is lying."" $S_J$ is true ($V_J=1$) and $S_P$ is true ($V_P=1$). So, it's not the case that only one is lying. The statement is false. $V_S=0$.
$S_G$: ""Steve is wrong."" $S_S$ is false ($V_S=0$), so this statement is true. $V_G=1$.

The truth values for B=T are $V_J=1, V_P=1, V_T=0, V_S=0, V_G=1$.
Let's check the sum of truth values: $1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3$.
This matches the mother's statement that exactly three sons are telling the truth.
Also, $V_S=0$ and $V_G=1$ satisfies $V_S+V_G=1$, which is consistent with $S_G \equiv \neg S_S$.

Since the assumption that Tom broke the window leads to a consistent set of truth values that satisfies all the given conditions, Tom must be the one who broke the window.

The final answer is $\boxed{Tom}$.",True

   Case 1a: $S_{GHIJ} = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}$.
      $S_{DEF} \cup S_{GHIJ} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\}$.
      $S_{ABC} = S \setminus \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\} = \{6, 8, 9\}$.
      Sum of digits in $S_{ABC}$ is $6+8+9=23$. This is not 9. So, this case is not possible.
   Case 1b: $S_{GHIJ} = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
      $S_{DEF} \cup S_{GHIJ} = \{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$.
      $S_{ABC} = S \setminus \{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\} = \{1, 6, 8\}$.
      Sum of digits in $S_{ABC}$ is $1+6+8=15$. This is not 9. So, this case is not possible.

Case 2: $S_{DEF} = \{2, 4, 6\}$.
   Case 2a: $S_{GHIJ} = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}$.
      $S_{DEF} \cup S_{GHIJ} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
      $S_{ABC} = S \setminus \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} = \{0, 8, 9\}$.
      Sum of digits in $S_{ABC}$ is $0+8+9=17$. This is not 9. So, this case is not possible.
   Case 2b: $S_{GHIJ} = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
      $S_{DEF} \cup S_{GHIJ} = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\}$.
      $S_{ABC} = S \setminus \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\} = \{0, 1, 8\}$.
      Sum of digits in $S_{ABC}$ is $0+1+8=9$. This matches the condition $A+B+C=9$.
      So, $S_{ABC} = \{0, 1, 8\}$. We need to check if $A>B>C$ is possible with these digits.
      The possible permutations of $\{0, 1, 8\}$ in decreasing order are (8, 1, 0).
      This gives $A=8$, $B=1$, $C=0$. Let's check $A>B>C$: $8>1>0$, which is true.
      Let's check $A+B+C=9$: $8+1+0=9$, which is true.
      The sets of digits are $S_{ABC} = \{8, 1, 0\}$, $S_{DEF} = \{2, 4, 6\}$, $S_{GHIJ} = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
      These sets are disjoint and their union is $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. This case is valid.
      In this case, $A=8$.

Case 3: $S_{DEF} = \{4, 6, 8\}$.
   Case 3a: $S_{GHIJ} = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}$.
      $S_{DEF} \cup S_{GHIJ} = \{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$.
      $S_{ABC} = S \setminus \{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} = \{0, 2, 9\}$.
      Sum of digits in $S_{ABC}$ is $0+2+9=11$. This is not 9. So, this case is not possible.
   Case 3b: $S_{GHIJ} = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
      $S_{DEF} \cup S_{GHIJ} = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
      $S_{ABC} = S \setminus \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$.
      Sum of digits in $S_{ABC}$ is $0+1+2=3$. This is not 9. So, this case is not possible.

Case 2b is the only case where the sum of the remaining digits is 9.
In Case 2b:
$S_{DEF} = \{2, 4, 6\}$, so $D>E>F$ implies $(D, E, F) = (6, 4, 2)$. These are consecutive even digits.
$S_{GHIJ} = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$, so $G>H>I>J$ implies $(G, H, I, J) = (9, 7, 5, 3)$. These are consecutive odd digits.
$S_{ABC} = \{0, 1, 8\}$. We must have $A>B>C$ and $A+B+C=9$.
The only ordered triple from $\{0, 1, 8\}$ satisfying $A>B>C$ is $(8, 1, 0)$.
For $(A, B, C) = (8, 1, 0)$: $A>B>C$ is $8>1>0$ (True), and $A+B+C=9$ is $8+1+0=9$ (True).
The digits $\{8, 1, 0, 6, 4, 2, 9, 7, 5, 3\}$ are $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$, all distinct.

This unique solution for the sets of digits gives $A=8$.

The telephone number is 810-642-9753.
ABC = 810 (8>1>0, 8+1+0=9)
DEF = 642 (6>4>2, 6,4,2 are consecutive even)
GHIJ = 9753 (9>7>5>3, 9,7,5,3 are consecutive odd)
Digits are {8,1,0,6,4,2,9,7,5,3}, which are all distinct digits from 0-9.

The value of A is 8.

The final answer is $\boxed{8}$.",True

The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire.

Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step, applying logical reasoning to the given constraints and available equipment.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Carlo needs to reach the diamond in the center of the room without triggering the alarm.
2.  **Identify the Alarm Condition:** The alarm triggers if more than 4 kilograms of pressure is applied to *any individual wire*.
3.  **Identify the Constraint:** Carlo weighs 74 kg. This is much greater than the 4 kg threshold. He cannot simply walk on the carpet because his full weight would likely press down on only a few wires, causing excessive pressure on at least one.
4.  **Analyze the Environment:**
    *   Room: 15m x 15m. Center is 7.5m from any wall.
    *   Alarm wires: Under the carpet, parallel, 8 cm apart.
    *   Pedestal: 1m high, in the center. The diamond is on top.
5.  **Analyze the Equipment:**
    *   5-meter 2x4 board: This is a rigid object that can be used to span across multiple wires. Its length is 500 cm.
    *   Four leather straps (2m long, 5cm wide): Flexible ties or supports.
    *   Hammer: Tool for pounding or breaking.
    *   Saw: Tool for cutting the board.
6.  **Develop a Strategy:** Carlo's main challenge is distributing his weight. The board is the key tool for this. A long, rigid board placed across the wires will spread his weight over many wires simultaneously.
7.  **Refine the Strategy - Reaching the Center:** Simply placing the 5m board down allows him to stand on it safely (as we'll calculate below), but he only has one board. He can't just pick it up and move forward while standing on it or off it onto the carpet. He needs a way to advance across the floor using the board. This suggests cutting the board into multiple pieces to use as stepping stones. The saw is provided for this purpose.
8.  **Determine Board Cutting Strategy:** Carlo needs at least two pieces of the board to perform a ""leapfrog"" or ""pontoon"" method of crossing. With two pieces, he can place one, step onto it, then place the second, step onto it, then retrieve the first piece from behind him and place it in front of the second, and so on.
9.  **Calculate Safe Board Length:** How long do the board pieces need to be to safely support 74 kg? Each piece must span enough wires so that 74 kg divided by the number of wires is 4 kg or less.
    *   Let 'L' be the length of a board piece in centimeters.
    *   The wires are 8 cm apart.
    *   A board placed perpendicular to the wires will rest on approximately L / 8 segments, meaning it crosses approximately (L / 8) + 1 wires (assuming the end points don't perfectly align with wire positions, it will cross slightly more segments than L/8). For simplicity and a conservative estimate, let's assume it crosses approximately L/8 wires (or round down L/8 and add 1 if L is not a multiple of 8, or simply use L/8 if L is large, as the +1 becomes negligible; let's use L/8 for now and round down the *number of wires* spanned).
    *   Number of wires spanned ≈ Floor(L / 8).
    *   Pressure per wire ≈ 74 kg / (Number of wires spanned).
    *   We need 74 kg / (Number of wires spanned) ≤ 4 kg.
    *   This means Number of wires spanned ≥ 74 / 4 = 18.5.
    *   So, the board piece must span at least 19 wires.
    *   To span at least 19 wires, the length L must be such that Floor(L / 8) ≥ 19.
    *   The smallest integer for L/8 that is ≥ 19 is 19. So, L / 8 must be at least 19. L ≥ 19 * 8 = 152 cm.
    *   A board piece needs to be at least 1.52 meters long to safely support Carlo's weight spread across the wires it spans.
10. **Choose Cutting Lengths:** The 5m board (500 cm) can be cut into two pieces. If he cuts it in half, each piece is 2.5m (250 cm).
    *   Number of wires spanned by a 2.5m piece: Floor(250 cm / 8 cm) = Floor(31.25) = 31 wires.
    *   Pressure per wire: 74 kg / 31 wires ≈ 2.39 kg/wire.
    *   2.39 kg is less than 4 kg. So, two 2.5m pieces are safe.
11. **Plan the Crossing (Leapfrog Method):**
    *   Start at the edge of the room, 7.5m from the center.
    *   Use the saw to cut the 5-meter board into two 2.5-meter pieces.
    *   Place the first 2.5m board piece (#1) on the carpet, perpendicular to the direction of the wires (assuming they run parallel to the walls, place it across the wires). Ensure it extends into the room from the edge.
    *   Carefully step onto board #1. His weight is distributed safely across the wires under the board.
    *   Place the second 2.5m board piece (#2) on the carpet in front of board #1, again perpendicular to the wires, potentially slightly overlapping board #1 for stability while transferring weight.
    *   Carefully step onto board #2. His weight is now safely distributed across the wires under board #2.
    *   Reach back and pick up board #1.
    *   Place board #1 on the carpet in front of board #2.
    *   Carefully step onto board #1.
    *   Reach back and pick up board #2.
    *   Place board #2 on the carpet in front of board #1.
    *   Repeat this process. Each cycle of placing the front board and stepping onto it moves Carlo forward by approximately the length of one board (minus any overlap).
12. **Estimate Distance Covered:** With two 2.5m boards, each ""leap"" moves him forward roughly 2.5m. To cover 7.5m to the center, he would need approximately 7.5m / 2.5m = 3 full board placements using the leapfrog method. This is easily achievable.
13. **Consider Other Equipment:**
    *   Straps: The straps aren't strictly necessary for the *crossing* part using the leapfrog method. They could *potentially* be used to help drag the boards if needed, or perhaps for securing the diamond once reached, but they don't play a critical role in avoiding the alarm during the crossing.
    *   Hammer: The hammer is also not needed for crossing the floor or avoiding the alarm. It might be intended for breaking the glass cube, but that's a separate problem from reaching the center without triggering the floor alarm.
14. **Conclusion on Alarm:** By using the saw to cut the board into pieces at least 1.52m long (e.g., two 2.5m pieces) and using these pieces to create a safe pathway across the pressure-sensitive floor via the leapfrog method, Carlo can ensure his weight is always distributed over enough wires to keep the pressure on any single wire below the 4 kg threshold, thus avoiding the alarm. The other equipment is not essential for *this specific task* of crossing the floor without triggering the alarm.

Yes, Carlo could do it.

**Reasoning Summary:**
Carlo cannot walk directly on the carpet due to his weight exceeding the 4 kg individual wire threshold. The alarm system's vulnerability is localized pressure. His primary tool for overcoming this is the rigid 5-meter board, which can distribute weight over multiple wires. To use the board to traverse the room, he must cut it into multiple pieces, which is possible using the saw. By cutting the 5-meter board into two 2.5-meter sections, each section is long enough (2.5m = 250cm) to span approximately 250cm / 8cm = 31 wires. Carlo's weight (74 kg) distributed over 31 wires results in approximately 74/31 ≈ 2.39 kg per wire, which is below the 4 kg limit. Using these two board sections, Carlo can employ a ""leapfrog"" technique: place board 1, step on it; place board 2 in front, step on it; pick up board 1, place it in front, step on it; and repeat. This allows him to advance 7.5 meters to the center of the room while always having his weight safely distributed on a board piece that spans enough wires to prevent triggering the alarm. The straps and hammer are not required for this specific task of crossing the floor safely.

Final answer: Yes.",True

Beethoven's Wig has been stolen again!  Instead of hiding it in a box, the enemy, who remains anonymous, has hidden it inside one of four castles.  Each castle is located in a different fantasyland and has a creature guarding its gates.  Use the clues below to put the lands in order (1st,2nd,3rd, and 4th), figure out which castle belongs in which land, which creature belong to which castle, and help Beethoven reclaim his wig!
Object: Beethoven's Wig
Fantasylands: Lothlorien, Mordor, Narnia, and Malacandra.
Creatures: Dragon, Troll, Giant, and Balrog.
Castles: Stone, Gold, Glass, and Silver.
1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
4.  The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
5.  The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
6.  Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
7.  The Troll is not at the Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.",,"Mordor is the first fantasyland.  It contains the Giant and the Silver Castle.

Lothlorien is the fourth land.  It contains the Troll and the Glass Castle.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's solve this logic puzzle step by step. We have four positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th) from left to right, each containing a Fantasyland, a Castle, and a Creature. The Wig is located at one of these positions.

We can represent the four positions and the items at each:

Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
1st     |             |          |          |
2nd     |             |          |          |
3rd     |             |          |          |
4th     |             |          |          |

Let's go through the clues and deduce the assignments.

1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
    *   Pos(Narnia) < Pos(Lothlorien)
    *   Pos(Balrog) < Pos(Lothlorien)

2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
    *   Pos(Wig) < Pos(Stone Castle)
    *   Stone Castle is at Malacandra OR Stone Castle is at Lothlorien.

3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
    *   Giant is not at Lothlorien's position.
    *   Giant is not at the Wig's position.

4.  The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
    *   Balrog is not at Lothlorien's position.
    *   Balrog is at the Stone Castle's position.
    *   Combining with Clue 2 (Stone Castle is at Malacandra or Lothlorien): Since Balrog is not at Lothlorien, the Stone Castle must be at Malacandra.
    *   Therefore, the Balrog is at Malacandra, which has the Stone Castle.

    Current deductions:
    *   The Fantasyland Malacandra has the Stone Castle, guarded by the Balrog.

    Let's update Clue 1 with this:
    *   Pos(Narnia) < Pos(Lothlorien)
    *   Pos(Malacandra) < Pos(Lothlorien) (Since Balrog is at Malacandra)

5.  The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
    *   Troll is not at the Golden Castle's position.
    *   Pos(Golden Castle) < Pos(Balrog)
    *   Pos(Silver Castle) < Pos(Golden Castle)

    Combine with previous deductions:
    *   Pos(Golden Castle) < Pos(Malacandra) (Since Balrog is at Malacandra)
    *   Pos(Silver Castle) < Pos(Golden Castle)

    This gives us a positional order for three castles and one land:
    Pos(Silver Castle) < Pos(Golden Castle) < Pos(Stone Castle) and Stone Castle is at Malacandra.
    Pos(Silver Castle) < Pos(Golden Castle) < Pos(Malacandra)

    Let's combine this with Pos(Malacandra) < Pos(Lothlorien) from Clue 1.
    The positional order of these four locations/castles is:
    Pos(Silver Castle) < Pos(Golden Castle) < Pos(Malacandra) < Pos(Lothlorien)

    Since there are only four positions, this order must correspond to the positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.
    *   Pos(Silver Castle) = 1st
    *   Pos(Golden Castle) = 2nd
    *   Pos(Malacandra) = 3rd
    *   Pos(Lothlorien) = 4th

    Let's start filling the table based on position:
    Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
    ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
    1st     |             | Silver   |          |
    2nd     |             | Gold     |          |
    3rd     | Malacandra  | Stone    | Balrog   |
    4th     | Lothlorien  |          |          |

    We know Stone Castle is at Malacandra (3rd), and Balrog is at Stone Castle (3rd). This fits perfectly. Lothlorien is at 4th position.

    Let's check other clues with the established positional order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).
    Clue 1: Narnia < Lothlorien (4th). Narnia can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
    Balrog (3rd) < Lothlorien (4th). Consistent.

    Clue 2: Wig < Stone Castle (3rd). Wig is at 1st or 2nd. Stone Castle is at Malacandra (3rd). Consistent.

    Clue 5: Golden Castle (2nd) < Balrog (3rd). Consistent. Golden Castle (2nd) > Silver Castle (1st). Consistent. Troll is not at Golden Castle (2nd).

6.  Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
    *   Dragon is at the 2nd position.
    *   Pos(Mordor) < Pos(Dragon) = 2nd. Mordor is at the 1st position.

    Update the table:
    Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
    ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
    1st     | Mordor      | Silver   |          |
    2nd     |             | Gold     | Dragon   |
    3rd     | Malacandra  | Stone    | Balrog   |
    4th     | Lothlorien  |          |          |

    Now let's place Narnia using Clue 1 (Narnia < Lothlorien (4th)) and available land slots.
    1st is Mordor. 3rd is Malacandra. 4th is Lothlorien.
    The only remaining position for Narnia (which must be before 4th) is 2nd.
    So Narnia is at the 2nd position.

    Update the table:
    Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
    ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
    1st     | Mordor      | Silver   |          |
    2nd     | Narnia      | Gold     | Dragon   |
    3rd     | Malacandra  | Stone    | Balrog   |
    4th     | Lothlorien  |          |          |

    All Fantasylands and Castles (except one) are placed. The remaining castle is Glass Castle. The only empty Castle slot is at the 4th position.
    *   Glass Castle is at the 4th position (Lothlorien).

    Update the table:
    Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
    ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
    1st     | Mordor      | Silver   |          |
    2nd     | Narnia      | Gold     | Dragon   |
    3rd     | Malacandra  | Stone    | Balrog   |
    4th     | Lothlorien  | Glass    |          |

    Now let's place the remaining creatures (Troll, Giant). The empty Creature slots are at 1st and 4th positions.

    Clue 5: Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle (2nd). Consistent.
    Clue 7: The Troll is not at the Silver Castle (1st).
    *   Troll is not at 1st position.
    *   Therefore, Troll must be at the 4th position.
    *   By elimination, the Giant must be at the 1st position.

    Update the table:
    Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
    ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
    1st     | Mordor      | Silver   | Giant    |
    2nd     | Narnia      | Gold     | Dragon   |
    3rd     | Malacandra  | Stone    | Balrog   |
    4th     | Lothlorien  | Glass    | Troll    |

    Let's verify remaining creature clues.
    Clue 3: Giant (1st) is not at Lothlorien (4th). Yes. Consistent.
    Clue 4: Balrog (3rd) is not in Lothlorien (4th). Yes. Consistent.
    Clue 5: Troll (4th) doesn't live at the Golden Castle (2nd). Yes. Consistent.
    Clue 7: Troll (4th) is not at the Silver Castle (1st). Yes. Consistent.

    Finally, let's place the Wig.
    Clue 2: Wig < Stone Castle (3rd). Wig is at 1st or 2nd.
    Clue 7: Silver Castle (1st) is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.
    *   Pos(Silver Castle) = Pos(Wig) - 1
    *   1st = Pos(Wig) - 1
    *   Pos(Wig) = 2nd

    The Wig is at the 2nd position.

    Update the table:
    Position | Fantasyland | Castle | Creature | Wig Location?
    ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------
    1st     | Mordor      | Silver   | Giant    | No
    2nd     | Narnia      | Gold     | Dragon   | Yes
    3rd     | Malacandra  | Stone    | Balrog   | No
    4th     | Lothlorien  | Glass    | Troll    | No

    Let's re-check Clue 2 and 3 about the Wig.
    Clue 2: Stone Castle (3rd) is to the right of the Wig (2nd). Yes, 3rd > 2nd. Consistent.
    Clue 3: Giant (1st) is not in the same place as the wig (2nd). Yes. Consistent.

    All clues are satisfied by this arrangement.

    Now, let's present the answer clearly as requested.

    The diagram (table) is complete.
    The order of the lands from 1st to 4th is: Mordor, Narnia, Malacandra, and Lothlorien.

    The castle in each land is:
    - In Mordor (1st) is the Silver Castle.
    - In Narnia (2nd) is the Gold Castle.
    - In Malacandra (3rd) is the Stone Castle.
    - In Lothlorien (4th) is the Glass Castle.

    The creature guarding each castle is:
    - At the Silver Castle (in Mordor) is the Giant.
    - At the Gold Castle (in Narnia) is the Dragon.
    - At the Stone Castle (in Malacandra) is the Balrog.
    - At the Glass Castle (in Lothlorien) is the Troll.

    Beethoven's Wig is located at the 2nd position, which is Narnia, in the Gold Castle, guarded by the Dragon.

Final answer:
Here is the breakdown of the solution based on the four positions from left (1st) to right (4th):

The order of the fantasylands is:
1st: Mordor
2nd: Narnia
3rd: Malacandra
4th: Lothlorien

The castle in each fantasyland is:
- Mordor (1st) has the Silver Castle.
- Narnia (2nd) has the Gold Castle.
- Malacandra (3rd) has the Stone Castle.
- Lothlorien (4th) has the Glass Castle.

The creature guarding each castle is:
- The Silver Castle (in Mordor) is guarded by the Giant.
- The Gold Castle (in Narnia) is guarded by the Dragon.
- The Stone Castle (in Malacandra) is guarded by the Balrog.
- The Glass Castle (in Lothlorien) is guarded by the Troll.

The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

First, let's apply the constraints from Clue 2 and the ""no leading zeroes"" rule.
Clue 2: No 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s are in the combination. The allowed digits are {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
""No leading zeroes"" usually means the first digit of each set is not zero.
So, A1, B1, C1, D1 $\in \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
A2, B2, C2, D2 $\in \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Now let's process the clues sequentially.

241,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The World Series is a best-of-seven series, meaning the first team to win four games is the champion.
2.  **Identify the Teams:** The teams playing are the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
3.  **Determine Hosting Schedule:** The problem states Los Angeles hosted the first two games and the last two games (if necessary). The other team, New York, hosted the middle three games. So, the schedule is:
    *   Game 1: Hosted by Los Angeles (LAD is Home)
    *   Game 2: Hosted by Los Angeles (LAD is Home)
    *   Game 3: Hosted by New York (NYY is Home)
    *   Game 4: Hosted by New York (NYY is Home)
    *   Game 5: Hosted by New York (NYY is Home)
    *   Game 6: Hosted by Los Angeles (LAD is Home)
    *   Game 7: Hosted by Los Angeles (LAD is Home)
4.  **Interpret Game Scores:** In standard baseball score reporting, the score is listed as Visitor team score to Home team score (Visitor - Home). We will use this convention for the provided scores.
5.  **Track Game Results and Cumulative Wins:** We will go through each game, determine the winner based on the score and hosting status, and update the series win count for each team.

    *   **Game 1:** Score 4 to 3. Hosted by LAD (Home). This means the Visitor (NYY) scored 4 and the Home (LAD) scored 3. NYY wins Game 1.
        *   Series Standing: Yankees 1, Dodgers 0.

    *   **Game 2:** Score 6 to 5 (11 innings). Hosted by LAD (Home). This means the Visitor (NYY) scored 6 and the Home (LAD) scored 5. NYY wins Game 2.
        *   Series Standing: Yankees 2, Dodgers 0.

    *   **Game 3:** Score 11 to 7. Hosted by NYY (Home). This means the Visitor (LAD) scored 11 and the Home (NYY) scored 7. LAD wins Game 3.
        *   Series Standing: Yankees 2, Dodgers 1.

    *   **Game 4:** Score 16 to 9. Hosted by NYY (Home). This means the Visitor (LAD) scored 16 and the Home (NYY) scored 9. LAD wins Game 4.
        *   Series Standing: Yankees 2, Dodgers 2.

    *   **Game 5:** Score 9 to 6 (10 innings). Hosted by NYY (Home). This means the Visitor (LAD) scored 9 and the Home (NYY) scored 6. LAD wins Game 5.
        *   Series Standing: Yankees 2, Dodgers 3.

    *   **Game 6:** Score 2 to 1. Hosted by LAD (Home). This means the Visitor (NYY) scored 2 and the Home (LAD) scored 1. NYY wins Game 6.

    *   **Game 7:** Score 13 to 8 (13 innings). Hosted by LAD (Home). This means the Visitor (NYY) scored 13 and the Home (LAD) scored 8. NYY wins Game 7.
        *   Series Standing: Yankees 4, Dodgers 3.

6.  **Determine the Champion:** The World Series ends when one team wins four games. After Game 7, the New York Yankees have 4 wins, and the Los Angeles Dodgers have 3 wins. The Yankees were the first team to reach 4 wins.

Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series.

242,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let $N$ be the total number of people, $N=86$.
The group split into two groups: a smaller group ($G_1$) and a bigger group ($G_2$).
So, $G_1 + G_2 = 86$ and $G_1 < G_2$.
Since $G_1$ and $G_2$ must be integers, $G_1$ can range from 1 up to 42 (since if $G_1=43$, $G_2=43$, and they would be equal). Thus $1 \le G_1 \le 42$ and $G_2 = 86 - G_1$, which means $44 \le G_2 \le 85$.

Let's analyze the given statements:

a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
This means either $\frac{1}{4}G_1 > G_2$ or $\frac{1}{4}G_2 > G_1$.
Since $G_1 < G_2$, the first case $\frac{1}{4}G_1 > G_2$ implies $\frac{1}{4}G_1 > G_1$, which is impossible for $G_1 > 0$.
So the second case must be true: $\frac{1}{4}G_2 > G_1$.
Substitute $G_1 = 86 - G_2$: $\frac{1}{4}G_2 > 86 - G_2$.
$G_2 > 4 \times 86 - 4G_2 \implies G_2 > 344 - 4G_2 \implies 5G_2 > 344 \implies G_2 > \frac{344}{5} = 68.8$.
Since $G_2$ must be an integer, $G_2 \ge 69$.
Combined with $G_2 \le 85$, we have $69 \le G_2 \le 85$.
This implies $G_1 = 86 - G_2$ must satisfy $86 - 85 \le G_1 \le 86 - 69$, so $1 \le G_1 \le 17$.
The possible pairs $(G_1, G_2)$ are $(1, 85), (2, 84), \dots, (17, 69)$. There are 17 such pairs.

b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
If group $G_k$ satisfies this, $W_k = 6M_k$. The total size is $G_k = M_k + W_k = M_k + 6M_k = 7M_k$.
So, either $G_1$ is a multiple of 7 or $G_2$ is a multiple of 7.

c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
If group $G_k$ satisfies this, it must contain an equal number of men and women, $M_k = W_k$. The total size is $G_k = M_k + W_k = M_k + M_k = 2M_k$.
So, either $G_1$ is an even number or $G_2$ is an even number.

d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
So, either $G_1$ is a multiple of 4 or $G_2$ is a multiple of 4.

e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.
If group $G_k$ satisfies this, $Y_k = 8O_k$. The total size is $G_k = O_k + Y_k = O_k + 8O_k = 9O_k$.
So, either $G_1$ is a multiple of 9 or $G_2$ is a multiple of 9.

Now we filter the possible pairs $(G_1, G_2)$ from $1 \le G_1 \le 17$ and $69 \le G_2 \le 85$:
Possible $G_1$: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
Corresponding $G_2$: 85, 84, 83, 82, 81, 8",True

245,"The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.
What was the question?",,Do you mind?,GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"This is a classic logic puzzle based on a self-referential paradox.

Let the question be Q.
The speaker says ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.""

This means:
1. The spoken answer to Q is ""yes"".
2. The true answer to Q is ""no"".

We are looking for a question Q such that if the true answer is ""no"", the speaker *must* say ""yes"" to satisfy the conditions.

Consider the question: ""Will your answer to this question be no?""

Let's analyze what happens if the speaker answers this question:

*   **Scenario 1: The speaker answers ""no"".**
    *   Their answer *is* ""no"".
    *   The question was ""Will your answer be no?"".
    *   By answering ""no"", they are confirming that their answer *is* ""no"".
    *   So, if they answer ""no"", the statement ""My answer to this question will be no"" is true.
    *   In this scenario, the spoken answer is ""no"", and the true answer (based on their response) is also ""no"". This does not fit the condition ""The answer I give is yes"".

*   **Scenario 2: The speaker answers ""yes"".**
    *   Their answer *is* ""yes"".
    *   The question was ""Will your answer be no?"".
    *   By answering ""yes"", they are asserting that ""My answer to this question *will be* no"".
    *   But their actual answer *is* ""yes"", not ""no"".
    *   Therefore, the statement ""My answer to this question will be no"" is false.
    *   If the statement ""My answer to this question will be no"" is false, then the true answer to the question ""Will your answer to this question be no?"" is ""no"".
    *   In this scenario, the spoken answer is ""yes"", and the true answer to the question is ""no"". This perfectly fits the condition: ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean (the true answer to the question) is no.""

Thus, the question must have been ""Will your answer to this question be no?"".

1.  **Identify the individuals:** There are 10 individuals in total: Grumpy, Dopey, Stumpy, Sneezy, Doc, Happy, Sleepy (the seven dwarfs) and Smelly, Droopy, Bashful (their three friends).

2.  **List all the clues as positional relationships:** Let ""A < B"" mean ""A is in front of B"".
    *   Clue 1: Grumpy < Dopey
    *   Clue 2: Sneezy < Stumpy and Doc < Stumpy
    *   Clue 3: Doc < Droopy and Doc < Happy
    *   Clue 4: Stumpy < Sleepy, Smelly < Sleepy, and Happy < Sleepy
    *   Clue 5: Happy < Sleepy, Happy < Smelly, and Happy < Bashful

    *   Clue 11: Sneezy < Dopey, Doc < Dopey, and Sleepy < Dopey
    *   Clue 12: Stumpy < Dopey
    *   Clue 13: Doc < Smelly

3.  **Consolidate and look for chains of relationships:**
    *   From Clue 13, we have Doc < Smelly.
    *   From Clue 8, we have Smelly < Sneezy, Smelly < Stumpy, and Smelly < Grumpy.
    *   Combining Doc < Smelly with these: Doc < Smelly < Sneezy, Doc < Smelly < Stumpy, Doc < Smelly < Grumpy.
    *   From Clue 2, we have Sneezy < Stumpy and Doc < Stumpy. Doc < Smelly < Stumpy is consistent with Doc < Stumpy and Smelly < Stumpy. Doc < Smelly < Sneezy < Stumpy is a consistent chain (Doc < Smelly, Smelly < Sneezy, Sneezy < Stumpy).

    Let's build on Doc:
    *   Doc < Happy (Clue 3)
    *   Doc < Smelly (Clue 13)
    *   Doc < Droopy (Clue 3)
    *   Doc < Dopey (Clue 11)
    *   Doc < Stumpy (Clue 2)

    Let's look for the person who is in front of the most people or who is not behind anyone based on the direct clues. Doc is in front of Smelly (13), Droopy (3), Happy (3), Stumpy (2), Dopey (11). Nobody is listed as being in front of Doc. This strongly suggests Doc is at or very near the front.

    Let's build a chain starting with Doc:
    *   Doc < Happy (Clue 3)
    *   Happy < Smelly (Clue 5)
    *   Smelly < Sneezy (Clue 8)
    *   Sneezy < Stumpy (Clue 2)
    *   Stumpy < Sleepy (Clue 4)
    *   Sleepy < Grumpy (Clue 10)
    *   Grumpy < Dopey (Clue 1)
    *   Dopey < Droopy (Clue 9)
    *   Droopy < Bashful (Clue 6)

    This gives the potential chain: Doc < Happy < Smelly < Sneezy < Stumpy < Sleepy < Grumpy < Dopey < Droopy < Bashful.

    Let's check if all other clues are consistent with this order of 10 people:
    1.  Grumpy < Dopey: Yes (Grumpy is just before Dopey).
    2.  Stumpy < Sneezy and Doc < Stumpy: No, this clue is *inconsistent* with Sneezy < Stumpy in my potential chain. Let's re-evaluate.

    Okay, let's re-read carefully and combine clues more rigorously.

    *   Doc < Stumpy (Clue 2), Doc < Droopy (Clue 3), Doc < Happy (Clue 3), Doc < Dopey (Clue 11), Doc < Smelly (Clue 13). Doc is in front of *at least* these 5.
    *   Smelly < Sleepy (Clue 4), Smelly < Grumpy (Clue 8), Smelly < Stumpy (Clue 8), Smelly < Sneezy (Clue 8), Smelly < Bashful (Clue 6). Smelly is in front of *at least* these 5.
    *   Happy < Sleepy (Clue 4 & 5), Happy < Smelly (Clue 5), Happy < Bashful (Clue 5). Happy is in front of *at least* these 3.
    *   Sleepy < Grumpy (Clue 10), Sleepy < Bashful (Clue 10 & 6), Sleepy < Dopey (Clue 11). Sleepy is in front of *at least* these 3.
    *   Sneezy < Stumpy (Clue 2), Sneezy < Dopey (Clue 7 & 11). Sneezy is in front of *at least* these 2.
    *   Stumpy < Sleepy (Clue 4), Stumpy < Dopey (Clue 12). Stumpy is in front of *at least* these 2.
    *   Grumpy < Dopey (Clue 1). Grumpy is in front of *at least* Dopey.
    *   Dopey < Droopy (Clue 9). Dopey is in front of *at least* Droopy.
    *   Droopy < Bashful (Clue 6). Droopy is in front of *at least* Bashful.
    *   Bashful is behind Smelly, Droopy, Sleepy, Happy. Bashful seems to be at the back.

    Let's chain from the back this time, starting with Bashful.
    *   Bashful is behind Smelly, Droopy, Sleepy, Happy.
    *   Droopy < Bashful (Clue 6)
    *   Dopey < Droopy (Clue 9) => Dopey < Droopy < Bashful
    *   Grumpy < Dopey (Clue 1) => Grumpy < Dopey < Droopy < Bashful
    *   Sleepy < Grumpy (Clue 10) => Sleepy < Grumpy < Dopey < Droopy < Bashful. This confirms Sleepy < Bashful (Clue 6 & 10).

    So we have the chain: Sleepy < Grumpy < Dopey < Droopy < Bashful. (5 people)

    Now let's place others relative to Sleepy.
    *   Stumpy < Sleepy (Clue 4). Where is Stumpy relative to Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful? Stumpy < Dopey (Clue 12). This is consistent with Stumpy < Sleepy < Dopey.
    *   Sneezy < Stumpy (Clue 2). Where is Sneezy relative to Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey...? Sneezy < Dopey (Clue 7 & 11). This is consistent with Sneezy < Stumpy < Dopey or Sneezy < Dopey directly.
    *   Smelly < Sleepy (Clue 4). Smelly < Grumpy (Clue 8). Smelly < Stumpy (Clue 8). Smelly < Sneezy (Clue 8). Smelly < Bashful (Clue 6 - consistent with Smelly < Sleepy < ... < Bashful). Smelly must be quite far forward.
    *   Happy < Sleepy (Clue 4 & 5). Happy < Smelly (Clue 5). Happy < Bashful (Clue 5). Happy must be even further forward than Smelly and Sleepy.

    Let's try building a chain from the front again, using the strongest ""in front"" relationships.
    *   Doc is in front of everyone else mentioned in the list (Doc < Stumpy, Droopy, Happy, Dopey, Smelly). Let's test if Doc is first. If Doc is first, let's see who comes next.
    *   Doc < Happy (Clue 3) and Happy < Smelly (Clue 5) => Doc < Happy < Smelly.
    *   Doc < Smelly (Clue 13). This is consistent with Doc < Happy < Smelly.
    *   Smelly < Sneezy (Clue 8) => Doc < Happy < Smelly < Sneezy.
    *   Sneezy < Stumpy (Clue 2) => Doc < Happy < Smelly < Sneezy < Stumpy.
    *   Stumpy < Sleepy (Clue 4) => Doc < Happy < Smelly < Sneezy < Stumpy < Sleepy.

    This chain is 6 people long: Doc, Happy, Smelly, Sneezy, Stumpy, Sleepy.
    Let's verify the clues used:
    *   Doc < Happy (3) - Yes.
    *   Happy < Smelly (5) - Yes.
    *   Smelly < Sneezy (8) - Yes.
    *   Sneezy < Stumpy (2) - Yes.
    *   Stumpy < Sleepy (4) - Yes.

    Let's check other clues against this partial order:
    *   Doc < Stumpy (2) - Yes (Doc < H < Sm < Sn < St).
    *   Smelly < Stumpy (8) - Yes (Sm < Sn < St).
    *   Doc < Smelly (13) - Yes (Doc < H < Sm).
    *   Happy < Sleepy (4 & 5) - Yes (H < Sm < Sn < St < Sl).
    *   Smelly < Sleepy (4) - Yes (Sm < Sn < St < Sl).

    Now, where do Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, and Bashful fit? We know they are behind Sleepy from our previous analysis (Sleepy < Grumpy < Dopey < Droopy < Bashful).
    Let's combine the two confirmed chains:
    Doc < Happy < Smelly < Sneezy < Stumpy < Sleepy (Chain 1)
    Sleepy < Grumpy < Dopey < Droopy < Bashful (Chain 2)

    Joining them at Sleepy gives the full order of 10 people:
    Doc, Happy, Smelly, Sneezy, Stumpy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful.

    Let's perform a final check against *all* original clues:
    1.  Grumpy < Dopey: Yes (Grumpy is before Dopey).
    2.  Sneezy < Stumpy and Doc < Stumpy: Yes (Sneezy is before Stumpy; Doc is before Stumpy).
    3.  Doc < Droopy and Doc < Happy: Yes (Doc is before Droopy; Doc is before Happy).
    4.  Stumpy < Sleepy, Smelly < Sleepy, Happy < Sleepy: Yes (Stumpy is before Sleepy; Smelly is before Sleepy; Happy is before Sleepy).
    5.  Happy < Sleepy, Happy < Smelly, Happy < Bashful: Yes (Happy is before Sleepy; Happy is before Smelly; Happy is before Bashful).
    6.  Smelly < Bashful, Droopy < Bashful, Sleepy < Bashful: Yes (Smelly is before Bashful; Droopy is before Bashful; Sleepy is before Bashful).
    7.  Sneezy < Dopey: Yes (Sneezy is before Dopey).
    8.  Smelly < Grumpy, Smelly < Stumpy, Smelly < Sneezy: Yes (Smelly is before Grumpy; Smelly is before Stumpy; Smelly is before Sneezy).
    9.  Dopey < Droopy: Yes (Dopey is before Droopy).
    10. Sleepy < Grumpy and Sleepy < Bashful: Yes (Sleepy is before Grumpy; Sleepy is before Bashful).
    11. Dopey was behind Sneezy, Doc and Sleepy: Yes (Sneezy is before Dopey; Doc is before Dopey; Sleepy is before Dopey).
    12. Stumpy was in front of Dopey: Yes (Stumpy is before Dopey).
    13. Smelly was behind Doc: Yes (Doc is before Smelly).

    All clues are perfectly consistent with this order.

The final order is Doc, Happy, Smelly, Sneezy, Stumpy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful.

Final verification:
1. Doc is in front of Happy, Smelly, Sneezy, Stumpy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful. (Matches Doc < Happy, Happy < Smelly, Smelly < Sneezy, Sneezy < Stumpy, Stumpy < Sleepy, Sleepy < Grumpy, Grumpy < Dopey, Dopey < Droopy, Droopy < Bashful)

3. Smelly is in front of Sneezy, Stumpy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful. (Matches Sm < Sn, Sn < St, St < Sl, Sl < G, G < D, D < Dr, Dr < B)
4. Sneezy is in front of Stumpy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful. (Matches Sn < St, St < Sl, Sl < G, G < D, D < Dr, Dr < B)
5. Stumpy is in front of Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful. (Matches St < Sl, Sl < G, G < D, D < Dr, Dr < B)

8. Dopey is in front of Droopy, Bashful. (Matches D < Dr, Dr < B)
9. Droopy is in front of Bashful. (Matches Dr < B)
10. Bashful is behind everyone.

This perfectly matches the derived chain.

Final order: Doc, Happy, Smelly, Sneezy, Stumpy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Droopy, Bashful.

The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4.

2.  $|d_i - d_{i+1}| \neq 1$ for $i = 1, \ldots, 8$.
3.  $\{d_2, d_4\} = \{2, 4\}$ and $\{d_6, d_8\} = \{6, 8\}$.
4.  $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 = 19$ and $d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 27$.

First, let's use the sum constraints (Constraint 4). The sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is $1+2+\ldots+9 = \frac{9 \times 10}{2} = 45$.
We are given the sum of the first five digits ($S_5 = 19$) and the sum of the last five digits ($S_{5-9} = 27$).
Notice that $d_5$ is included in both sums. If we add these two sums, we get:
$S_5 + S_{5-9} = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5) + (d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9) = 19 + 27 = 46$.
This sum is also equal to the sum of all nine digits plus $d_5$:
$(d_1 + \ldots + d_9) + d_5 = 45 + d_5$.
So, $45 + d_5 = 46$, which implies $d_5 = 1$.

Now we know the fifth digit is 1. The sequence looks like $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, 1, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9$.

Let's use the adjacency constraint (Constraint 2) with $d_5 = 1$.
$|d_4 - d_5| \neq 1 \implies |d_4 - 1| \neq 1$. This means $d_4 \neq 0$ (which is true for digits 1-9) and $d_4 \neq 2$.
$|d_5 - d_6| \neq 1 \implies |1 - d_6| \neq 1$. This means $d_6 \neq 0$ (true) and $d_6 \neq 2$.

From Constraint 3, we know $\{d_2, d_4\} = \{2, 4\}$. Since $d_4 \neq 2$, $d_4$ must be 4. This means $d_2$ must be 2.
So the sequence is $d_1, 2, d_3, 4, 1, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9$.

Let's update the sum constraints using $d_2=2$, $d_4=4$, and $d_5=1$.
$d_1 + 2 + d_3 + 4 + 1 = 19 \implies d_1 + d_3 + 7 = 19 \implies d_1 + d_3 = 12$.
$1 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 27 \implies d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 26$.

The digits used so far are {1, 2, 4}. The remaining digits are {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. These digits must fill positions $d_1, d_3, d_6, d_7, d_8, d",True

Since A and H agree with each other while E and F are against them, exactly two of these four must be true.
Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
249,"Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?
1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this
order): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark
chocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.
2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one
from milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.
3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.
4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.
5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.
6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.
7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped
chocolate is #1.",,"Solution:
