0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Identify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.  Name the order that the daughters were born in and the day of the week that they leave to go home.  What is the seating arrangement at the dinner table?
Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.

Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

9,"""What's the password?"" asked The Entity, with a weasel-like demeanor. Spy IQ was confused, until he realized he had received a strange postcard weeks before. The crafty spy still needed to enter the underground cellar leading to a new set of gadgets to be used on the next mission, but he was halted by The Entity's presence. What the postcard said might help Spy IQ find the password The Entity needs to allow the spy into the secret lair. The postcard says this:

It was my niece.
Wouldn't you agree?
It was because she joined a band of bikers.
She's doing lots of things wrong.
She always shows a lot of toughness.

That P.S. looks like it could be the catalyst to solve for the encrypted password. But, what could it be?","Look closely at the P.S.
A secret message lies within the P.S. that will assist you in searching for the password.
Here, I'll change it up a bit:
P.S.
Isaac Newton:

If you look carefully at the P.S., you will notice that the first letter of each word spells IN NOBLE GASES:

After saying the password, Spy IQ entered the secret lair and found useful gadgets, including Instant Tile Camouflage.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break down this puzzle step by step.

1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Spy IQ needs a password to enter the cellar. The Entity knows the password. The password is hidden in a strange postcard.

2.  **Analyze the Postcard Content:** The postcard has two parts:
    *   A main body of text about an expelled niece who joined bikers, is doing wrong things, and shows toughness.
    *   A P.S. attributed to Isaac Newton, containing two seemingly unrelated sentences: ""Near orange bags lying east."" and ""Gets as strange equally slowly.""

3.  **Focus on the Hint:** The prompt specifically states, ""That P.S. looks like it could be the catalyst to solve for the encrypted password."" This strongly suggests the main body text is flavor or misdirection, and the key lies within the P.S.

4.  **Examine the P.S. Closely:**
    *   ""P.S."" - A standard postscript marker.
    *   ""Isaac Newton:"" - The attribution. Newton is famous for physics, gravity, laws of motion, calculus, optics. Does this name directly point to the solution? Perhaps it hints at a scientific theme.
    *   Sentence 1: ""Near orange bags lying east.""
    *   Sentence 2: ""Gets as strange equally slowly.""

5.  **Look for Patterns or Codes in the Sentences:** Cryptic clues often involve extracting information from the text itself. Common methods include:
    *   Taking specific letters (first letters, last letters, letters at certain positions).
    *   Counting things (words, letters).
    *   Anagrams.
    *   Substitution ciphers (less likely without a key).

6.  **Try the Most Common Method for Such Sentences: Acrostics:** Let's try taking the first letter of each word in each sentence.
    *   Sentence 1: **N**ear **o**range **b**ags **l**ying **e**ast.
        The first letters are N, O, B, L, E. This spells **NOBLE**.
    *   Sentence 2: **G**ets **a**s **s**trange **e**qually **s**lowly.
        The first letters are G, A, S, E, S. This spells **GASES**.

7.  **Combine the Results:** Putting the two words together, we get **NOBLE GASES**.

8.  **Evaluate ""NOBLE GASES"" as a Potential Password:**
    *   Is it a recognizable term? Yes, Noble Gases are a group of chemical elements (Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon, Oganesson).
    *   Does it fit the context of a password derived from a cryptic clue? Yes, extracting terms this way is a classic puzzle mechanism.
    *   Does the attribution to Isaac Newton make sense? While Noble Gases weren't discovered *as a group* and understood in Newton's time (they were mainly identified in the late 19th century), the P.S. *attributes* the message to him. This suggests the *message itself* contains the clue, and the Newton attribution might simply add a scientific theme or be a slight misdirection. The core discovery comes directly from the sentences provided.

9.  **Conclusion:** The most direct and logical interpretation of the P.S., following common cryptic puzzle patterns, is to take the first letters of each word in the two sentences. This yields ""NOBLE GASES"". This is a plausible password phrase derived directly from the text.

Final answer: NOBLE GASES",True

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.

5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.
A) H can not be 8.  C can not be 1.  C can not be 0.  B can not be 9.  D can not be 1.  D can not be 2.  F can not be 1.

16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True
21,"Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""

""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""

Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:30        Elena        0:50 later, 1:30 after Derec, 1:20 after Adele
7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.

2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F

Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)

If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid

One of them is false.  C's and D's  contradict each other.  One of them is false.  Therefore, there are four additional false statements.
Assume A is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's second statement, and D's first statement are the additional false statements.
Assume D is guilty.  If so, A's second statement, B's first statement, and D's third statement are false.  This also only makes five false statements.  D did not do it.
Assume C did it.  If so, A's second statement, D's first and third statements are false.  This again, makes only five false statements.
After ruling out suspects A, C and D, B is the culprit.  B's third statement, C's second statement, and D's first and third statements are the additional false statements.  This adds up to six.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the four suspects be A, B, C, and D. Let G_X denote the proposition that suspect X is guilty. We are given that exactly one of G_A, G_B, G_C, G_D is true.
Let K be the proposition ""The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car."" The problem states that the thief ""unknowingly took the automobile"", which means K is a true statement about the thief. Since there is only one thief, K is a universally true proposition in this scenario. So, T(K) = True.

Let's write down the statements and their truth values:
Suspect A:
A1: C and I have met many times before today. Let this be M_CA. T(A1) = M_CA.
A2: B is guilty. T(A2) = G_B.
A3: The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car. T(A3) = K.

Suspect B:
B1: D did not do it. T(B1) = ~G_D.
B2: D's third statement is false. T(B2) = ~T(D3).
B3: I am innocent. T(B3) = ~G_B.

Suspect C:
C1: I have never met A before today. T(C1) = ~M_CA.
C2: B is not guilty. T(C2) = ~G_B.
C3: D knows how to drive. Let this be H_D. T(C3) = H_D.

Suspect D:
D1: B's first statement is false. T(D1) = ~T(B1).
D2: I do not know how to drive. T(D2) = ~H_D.
D3: A did it. T(D3) = G_A.

We are given that T(K) = True. Therefore, A3 is a True statement. T(A3) = T.

Let's analyze the logical relationships between the statements:
1. T(A2) = G_B, T(B3) = ~G_B, T(C2) = ~G_B. Note that B3 and C2 are the same statement.
2. T(B1) = ~G_D, T(D1) = ~T(B1) = ~ (~G_D) = G_D. B1 and D1 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.
3. T(D3) = G_A, T(B2) = ~T(D3) = ~G_A. B2 and D3 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.
4. T(C3) = H_D, T(D2) = ~H_D. C3 and D2 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.
5. T(A1) = M_CA, T(C1) = ~M_CA. A1 and C1 are contradictory; one is True and one is False.

We have 12 statements in total. Six are True and six are False.
Statements involved in pairs of contradictions are: B1, D1, B2, D3, C3, D2, A1, C1. These 8 statements form 4 pairs, each contributing one True and one False statement. So, these 8 statements account for 4 True and 4 False statements in total.

The remaining 4 statements are A2, A3, B3, C2. These must account for the remaining 2 True and 2 False statements.
A2: G_B
A3: K (We know T(A3) = T)
B3: ~G_B
C2: ~G_B
Note B3 and C2 are the same statement. Let's call the truth value V_B3C2.
The statements are {A2, A3, B3/C2}. Their truth values are {T(A2), T(A3), V_B3C2}.
T(A2) = G_B
T(A3) = T
V_B3C2 = ~G_B

We need this set of statements to contain 2 True and 2 False values among A2, A3, B3, C2.
Since B3 and C2 are the same statement, they have the same truth value (V_B3C2).
If G_B is True: T(A2)=T, V_B3C2=F. The truth values are {T, T, F, F} for {A2, A3, B3, C2}. This is 2 True and 2 False, which is consistent.
If G_B is False: T(A2)=F, V_B3C2=T. The truth values are {F, T, T, T} for {A2, A3, B3, C2}. This is 3 True and 1 False, which is NOT consistent with needing 2 True and 2 False from this group.

Therefore, it must be that G_B is True.
This means B is the car thief.

Let's verify this solution by checking if the truth count works out with G_B = True and K = True.
If G_B is True, then G_A, G_C, G_D must be False (since only one person is guilty).
K is True.

Truth values determined by guilt and K:
A2 (G_B): T
A3 (K): T
B3 (~G_B): F
C2 (~G_B): F
B1 (~G_D): ~F = T
D1 (G_D): F (Consistent with B1)
B2 (~G_A): ~F = T
D3 (G_A): F (Consistent with B2)

Definite truth values so far:
A2 (T), A3 (T), B1 (T), B2 (T), B3 (F), C2 (F), D1 (F), D3 (F).
This gives 4 True and 4 False statements.

The remaining statements are A1 (M_CA), C1 (~M_CA), C3 (H_D), D2 (~H_D).
As noted before, A1 and C1 are contradictory, so one is True and one is False.
C3 and D2 are contradictory, so one is True and one is False.
These 4 statements contribute 2 True and 2 False statements.

Total True statements = (T(A2)+T(A3)+T(B1)+T(B2)) + (one of A1/C1) + (one of C3/D2) = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.
Total False statements = (T(B3)+T(C2)+T(D1)+T(D3)) + (one of A1/C1) + (one of C3/D2) = 4",True

32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.

12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.

Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?","On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.

**Lap 1 Reasoning:**

*   ""Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots.""
    *   These four are in places 1, 2, 3, 4.
*   ""In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst.""
    *   The ranks of these four are: Stephen (1), Ben (12), Paul (12), Jessica (11).
    *   The bottom two ranked people are Ben (12) and Paul (12). They are in the top two spots (1st and 2nd).
    *   The top ranked person is Stephen (1). He is in the worst spot among the four (4th).
    *   This places Jessica (Rank 11) in 3rd.
    *   So, 1st: Ben or Paul, 2nd: Paul or Ben, 3rd: Jessica, 4th: Stephen.
*   ""The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th.""
    *   The Major is Felicia (Rank 5). Brianna (Rank 12) passed her.
    *   This places Brianna in 5th and Felicia in 6th.
*   ""Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order.""
    *   Luke (Rank 12) is in 9th place.
    *   Clark (Rank 6) and Brad (Rank 10) passed Luke in that order. This means Clark is 7th and Brad is 8th.
*   ""The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.""
    *   The back three girls are Anna (Rank 3), Abby (Rank 10), and Kelsey (Rank 12).
    *   Highest rank (Anna) is 10th place.
    *   Middle rank (Abby) is 11th place.
    *   Lowest rank (Kelsey) is 12th place.
    *   So, Anna is 10th, Abby is 11th, and Kelsey is 12th.

Let's reconstruct the order at the end of Lap 1 based on these clues:
1.  Ben or Paul
2.  Paul or Ben
3.  Jessica
4.  Stephen
5.  Brianna
6.  Felicia
7.  Clark
8.  Brad
9.  Luke
10. Anna
11. Abby
12. Kelsey

**Lap 2 Reasoning:**

We start from the Lap 1 end order.
*   ""Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front.""
    *   Paul was either 1st or 2nd. Falling to 3rd means he was 2nd, and the person ""right by"" him (who was 1st) is now ""way in front"" (stayed 1st).
    *   So, at the end of Lap 1, the order was: 1st Ben, 2nd Paul, 3rd Jessica...
    *   After Paul slips from 2nd to 3rd: Ben remains 1st. Jessica moves up to 2nd. Everyone previously 3rd or worse shifts down one spot.
    *   Order after Paul slips: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Brianna, 6. Felicia, 7. Clark, 8. Brad, 9. Luke, 10. Anna, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each.""
    *   Clark is currently in 7th place. He moves up 2 spots to 5th place.
    *   The people previously in 5th (Brianna) and 6th (Felicia) are pushed back one place each, to 6th and 7th respectively.
    *   Order after Clark moves: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Clark, 6. Brianna, 7. Felicia, 8. Brad, 9. Luke, 10. Anna, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""Then, Felicia and Anna switched places...""
    *   Felicia is currently in 7th place. Anna is currently in 10th place. They swap.
    *   Order after Felicia/Anna swap: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Clark, 6. Brianna, 7. Anna, 8. Brad, 9. Luke, 10. Felicia, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""...and Luke and Brad switched places.""
    *   Luke is currently in 9th place. Brad is currently in 8th place. They swap.
    *   Order after Luke/Brad swap: 1. Ben, 2. Jessica, 3. Paul, 4. Stephen, 5. Clark, 6. Brianna, 7. Anna, 8. Luke, 9. Brad, 10. Felicia, 11. Abby, 12. Kelsey.
*   ""The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.""
    *   Abby is currently in 11th place. Kelsey is currently in 12th place. They swap.

Lap 2 Final Order:

**Calculate New Ranks:**

We use the final place and the initial rank to calculate the new rank.
Rank list: 1. Lieutenant General, 2. Brigadier General, 3. Colonel, 4. Lieutenant Colonel, 5. Major, 6. Captain, 7. First Lieutenant, 8. Second Lieutenant, 9. First Sergeant, 10. Sergeant, 11. Corporal, 12. Private.
Scoring: 1st (+5), 2nd (+4), 3rd (+3), 4th/5th (+1), 6th/7th (0), 8th/9th (-1), 10th/11th (-2), 12th (-3).
If the new rank goes above 1 or below 12, the person stays at rank 1 or 12.

1.  **Ben:** 1st place (+5 ranks). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 - 5 = 7. Rank 7 is First Lieutenant.
2.  **Paul:** 2nd place (+4 ranks). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 - 4 = 8. Rank 8 is Second Lieutenant.
3.  **Jessica:** 3rd place (+3 ranks). Initial Rank 11 (Corporal). New Rank = 11 - 3 = 8. Rank 8 is Second Lieutenant.
4.  **Stephen:** 4th place (+1 rank). Initial Rank 1 (Lieutenant General). New Rank = 1 - 1 = 0. Cannot go above Rank 1. Stays at Rank 1. Rank 1 is Lieutenant General.
5.  **Brianna:** 5th place (+1 rank). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 - 1 = 11. Rank 11 is Corporal.
6.  **Clark:** 6th place (0 rank change). Initial Rank 6 (Captain). New Rank = 6 + 0 = 6. Rank 6 is Captain.
7.  **Luke:** 7th place (0 rank change). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 + 0 = 12. Rank 12 is Private.
8.  **Anna:** 8th place (-1 rank). Initial Rank 3 (Colonel). New Rank = 3 + 1 = 4. Rank 4 is Lieutenant Colonel.
9.  **Kelsey:** 9th place (-1 rank). Initial Rank 12 (Private). New Rank = 12 + 1 = 13. Cannot go below Rank 12. Stays at Rank 12. Rank 12 is Private.
10. **Felicia:** 10th place (-2 ranks). Initial Rank 5 (Major). New Rank = 5 + 2 = 7. Rank 7 is First Lieutenant.
11. **Brad:** 11th place (-2 ranks). Initial Rank 10 (Sergeant). New Rank = 10 + 2 = 12. Rank 12 is Private.
12. **Abby:** 12th place (-3 ranks). Initial Rank 10 (Sergeant). New Rank = 10 + 3 = 13. Cannot go below Rank 12. Stays at Rank 12. Rank 12 is Private.

Final List of Places and New Ranks:

*   1st Place: Ben, new rank First Lieutenant
*   2nd Place: Paul, new rank Second Lieutenant

2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML.

46,A man named Stewart is traveling all over the world. First he travels to Cape Town in South Africa. Then to Jakarta in Indonesia. Then to Canberra in Australia. Then to Rome in Italy. Then to Panama City in Panama. Where does he travel next?,Each time he travels to a continent he has not traveled to.,Santiago in Chile. He travels to each continent in alphabetical order then to the capital of the country that has the most southern latitude.,GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Here is my reasoning process to solve this problem:

1.  **Analyze the Input:** I am given a sequence of destinations: Cape Town, Jakarta, Canberra, Rome, and Panama City. I need to find the next destination in this sequence based on a pattern.

2.  **List the Destinations:**
    *   Cape Town
    *   Jakarta
    *   Canberra
    *   Rome
    *   Panama City

3.  **Look for Patterns:** I will examine different properties of the destination names and locations:
    *   **Geographic location:** Are they ordered by continent, latitude, longitude, or proximity?
        *   Cape Town (Africa)
        *   Jakarta (Asia)
        *   Canberra (Australia)
        *   Rome (Europe)
        *   Panama City (North/Central America)
        The sequence visits different continents without an obvious geographical order.
    *   **Capital cities:** Are they all capital cities?
        *   Cape Town is one of South Africa's capitals.
        *   Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia.
        *   Canberra is the capital of Australia.
        *   Rome is the capital of Italy.
        *   Panama City is the capital of Panama.
        Yes, they are all capital cities (or a capital city in South Africa's case). This is a shared property but doesn't define the sequence order.
    *   **Letters in the names:** I will examine the starting and ending letters of the names.
        *   Cape Tow**n** (Starts with C, Ends with N)
        *   **J**akart**a** (Starts with J, Ends with A)
        *   **C**anberr**a** (Starts with C, Ends with A)
        *   **R**om**e** (Starts with R, Ends with E)
        *   **P**anama Cit**y** (Starts with P, Ends with Y)
        The sequence of starting letters is C, J, C, R, P. There is no obvious alphabetical or other simple pattern here.
        The sequence of ending letters is N, A, A, E, Y. There is no obvious pattern here either.

4.  **Consider Relationships Between Consecutive Destinations:** A common type of word sequence puzzle relates the end of one item to the start of the next. Let's test the hypothesis that the *ending letter* of a destination is the *starting letter* of the *next* destination.
    *   Cape Tow**n**. Does the next city, Jakarta, start with N? No (it starts with J).
    *   Jakart**a**. Does the next city, Canberra, start with A? No (it starts with C).
    *   Canberr**a**. Does the next city, Rome, start with A? No (it starts with R).
    *   Rom**e**. Does the next city, Panama City, start with E? No (it starts with P).

5.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** The simple rule ""ending letter of city N is the starting letter of city N+1"" does not hold true for the entire given sequence. However, in many riddles of this type, the pattern is established by the items in the list, and the rule derived is applied specifically to the *last* item to find the *next* item. The sequence provided serves to demonstrate the *type* of pattern being used (based on letters of names), and the rule is then used for the final step. The most common pattern of this type is indeed linking the end of one name to the start of the next.

6.  **Apply the Rule to the Last Item:** Assuming the pattern that determines the *next* destination is based on the *last* destination provided:
    *   The last destination is Panama Cit**y**.

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.

Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.

...got it?",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let the six men be Alan (A), Boris (B), Chuck (C), Dalman (D), Edwin (E), and Finney (F). There are three Paley brothers (P) and three Thomson brothers (T). Three men are truth-tellers (TT) and three are liars (LL). Neither set of brothers consists exclusively of liars, meaning each family has at least one truth-teller.

Let's analyze the statements:
1.  Alan: ""Both my brothers tell lies.""
2.  Boris: ""Both my brothers tell the truth.""
3.  Chuck: ""Alan and Boris are both liars.""
4.  Dalman: ""Chuck and I are brothers.""
5.  Edwin: ""Boris and I are brothers.""
6.  Finney: ""Edwin tells the truth.""
7.  Finney: ""Boris is one of the Paleys.""

Let's use T for truth-teller and L for liar.
Statement 6: Finney says ""Edwin tells the truth.""
- If Finney is T, the statement is true, so Edwin is T.
- If Finney is L, the statement is false, so Edwin is L.
Thus, Finney and Edwin have the same status: Status(F) = Status(E).

There are two possibilities for (Status(F), Status(E)): (T, T) or (L, L).

Case 1: (F, E) = (T, T). Both Finney and Edwin are truth-tellers.
Statement 7: Finney is T, so his statement ""Boris is one of the Paleys"" is true. Boris is a Paley.
Statement 5: Edwin is T, so his statement ""Boris and I are brothers"" is true. Edwin and Boris are brothers. Since Boris is a Paley, Edwin must also be a Paley.
So, Boris and Edwin are Paley brothers. The Paley family consists of Boris, Edwin, and one other person from {A, C, D, F}.
Finney is T. If Finney were the third Paley brother, then P = {B, E, F}. Their statuses would be (B=?, E=T, F=T).
Statement 2: Boris says ""Both my brothers tell the truth."" Boris's brothers would be Edwin and Finney. Both are T.
- If Boris were T, $S_B$ (""Both E and F are T"") would be true, consistent with B being T. So {B, E, F} could be all TT.
- If Boris were L, $S_B$ (""Both E and F are T"") would be true, inconsistent with B being L. So B cannot be L if P={B,E,F}.
So if P = {B, E, F}, all three must be TT. This would mean $S_{TT}=\{B, E, F\}$, and $S_{LL}=\{A, C, D\}$. This implies that the Thomson family {A, C, D} are all liars. This contradicts the constraint that neither set of brothers consists exclusively of liars.
Therefore, Finney is not the third Paley brother. Finney must be a Thomson.

So, if (F, E) = (T, T), then Boris is Paley, Edwin is Paley, and Finney is Thomson.
$P = \{B, E, X\}$ where X is one of {A, C, D}. $T = \{F, Y, Z\}$ where {Y, Z} = {A, C, D} \ {X}.
Statuses so far: E(T), F(T). $S_{TT}$ contains {E, F}. We need one more TT. $S_{LL}$ contains 3 people.

Statement 2: Boris says ""Both my brothers tell the truth."" His brothers are E and X. E is T.

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to determine if a contract to use a truck carrying 22 tons of water to supply a canal with 13 locks, which loses 7000 L per lock use and has no top supply, is ""reasonable"". ""Reasonable"" in this context likely means whether the truck's capacity is sufficient or practical for the task of supplying the needed water.

2.  **Identify the Water Need:**
    *   There are 13 locks.
    *   Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
    *   There is no water supply at the top.

3.  **Interpret ""Lock Use"" and ""Water Loss"":** In a flight of locks, when a boat goes *up*, water is drawn from the pound *above* each lock to fill the lock chamber. This water is then discharged to the pound *below* when the boat exits the lock at the higher level. Since there's no water supply at the top, this water that is moved downwards through the flight must be replaced at the top level to maintain sufficient depth for continued operation, especially for future upward passages. The 7000 L loss per lock is most likely referring to this volume of water that needs to be replenished at the higher level (ultimately the top pound) for every upward passage through that lock.

4.  **Calculate Total Water Needed Per Upward Passage:**
    *   To pass one boat *up* through the entire flight of 13 locks, water is effectively moved from higher levels to lower levels at each lock.
    *   The total volume of water moved down through the entire flight for one boat going up is the sum of the water used from each pound above each lock.
    *   Total water needing replenishment at the top = Number of locks * Water loss per lock
    *   Total water needed = 13 locks * 7000 L/lock = 91000 L.
    *   This 91000 L of water must be transported from the bottom (where the water ends up) back up to the top.

5.  **Determine the Truck's Capacity in Liters:**
    *   The truck capacity is 22 tons of water.
    *   The density of fresh water is approximately 1 tonne per cubic meter (1000 kg/m³).
    *   1 cubic meter (m³) = 1000 Liters (L).
    *   So, 1 tonne of water ≈ 1000 kg ≈ 1000 L.
    *   Truck capacity in Liters = 22 tons * 1000 L/ton = 22000 L.

6.  **Compare Water Needed to Truck Capacity:**
    *   Water needed at the top *per boat passage up the flight*: 91000 L.
    *   Truck capacity *per trip*: 22000 L.

7.  **Calculate Number of Truck Trips Needed Per Upward Passage:**
    *   Number of trips = Total water needed / Truck capacity per trip
    *   Number of trips = 91000 L / 22000 L/trip = 91 / 22 ≈ 4.136 trips.
    *   Since the truck must complete full trips, it needs to make 5 trips to carry enough water (5 * 22000 L = 110000 L) to replenish the amount effectively lost from the top system when one boat goes up the entire flight.

8.  **Evaluate Reasonableness of the Contract:**
    *   The contract involves using a truck with a capacity of 22000 L per trip to supply water to a system where 91000 L is needed at the top for every boat that goes up the entire flight.
    *   A single trip by this truck provides only 22000 L, which is less than one-quarter of the water needed for one boat to ascend the flight.
    *   To support just *one* boat going up, the truck would need to make 5 round trips from the bottom to the top.
    *   Canal locks are often used by multiple boats daily. If several boats use the canal, the required water transport quickly increases to many truckloads per day.
    *   Given the large volume of water required per boat passage (91000 L) compared to the relatively small volume the truck can carry per trip (22000 L), relying solely on this truck to maintain the necessary water levels for typical canal usage appears highly inefficient and labour-intensive.
    *   Therefore, the contract is likely not reasonable *as a primary solution* for supplying the necessary water to keep the canal operational for anything more than very infrequent use, due to the mismatch between the truck's capacity and the volume of water needed. If the contract is for a single delivery or very limited service, it might be ""reasonable"" for that specific task, but it doesn't address the underlying problem of supplying enough water for regular operation. The question implies the contract is intended to address the water supply problem.

Final answer: No, the contract is likely not reasonable as a sufficient solution for supplying water to the canal for typical operation. A single boat going up the flight of 13 locks requires approximately 91000 L of water to be replenished at the top. The truck can only carry 22000 L per trip. This means the truck would need to make 5 trips just to supply enough water for one boat to ascend the entire flight. For regular canal usage with multiple boats, this would require a very large number of truck journeys, making it impractical and likely very expensive compared to other potential solutions like pumping or finding an alternative water source.",True

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break down this scenario step by step, applying careful logic to figure out Company B's clever and honest offer.

1.  **Initial Situation:** The Emperor needs a bridge for a ""difficult and dangerous"" job.
    *   Company A offers to do it for $800,000. We can assume this is the price for a successfully completed bridge. What happens if Company A fails? The story doesn't explicitly say, but in a standard contract for such a risky job, the payment structure is key. Let's consider possibilities later.
    *   Company B states they cannot do it for less than $1,000,000. This is Company B's price for a successfully completed bridge, reflecting their assessment of the difficulty and cost involved.

2.  **Company B's New Offer:** Contractor B returns with a seemingly strange offer: the Emperor *can pay* $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 *for the job*. The crucial phrase here is ""for the job."" This doesn't sound like the Emperor gets to just pick a price for the exact same service. Instead, the different payment amounts must be tied to different *outcomes* of the job, especially given that it's described as ""difficult and dangerous.""

3.  **Interpreting Company B's Offer Structure:** Given the high risk and the tiered payment options, the most logical interpretation is that these are not selectable prices for the same service, but rather pre-agreed payment amounts contingent on the *degree of success* achieved in building the bridge.
    *   The highest amount, $1,000,000, aligns with Company B's initial stated minimum for the completed job. This is almost certainly the payment for *successful completion* of the bridge.
    *   The lowest amount, $200,000, is much lower than the cost of building the bridge. This must represent the payment in the worst-case scenario for Company B – complete *failure* to build the bridge. This payment would likely cover some initial costs, planning, or effort, but not the full cost or profit for a successful build.
    *   The middle amount, $750,000, likely represents an intermediate outcome – perhaps partial completion, completion with significant issues or delays, or reaching a major milestone short of full success.

4.  **Hypothesizing the Contract Terms:** Based on this, Company B's offer was likely structured as follows:
    *   ""We will attempt to build the bridge. We agree to the following payment terms based on the outcome of our work:
        *   If we fail to complete the bridge: You will pay us $200,000.
        *   If we partially complete the bridge, or complete it with significant issues: You will pay us $750,000.
        *   If we successfully complete the bridge as agreed: You will pay us $1,000,000.""

5.  **Why the Emperor Accepted (Why it Sounded So Good):** Now, compare this offer structure to Company A's offer of $800,000.
    *   Company A's offer of $800,000 was likely either:
        *   a) $800,000 upon successful completion (meaning the Emperor pays nothing if they fail).
        *   b) A fixed price of $800,000 for undertaking the project, regardless of outcome (meaning the Emperor pays $800,000 even if they fail).

    *   If Company A's offer was (a) – $800k for success, $0 for failure – then Company B's offer is worse in *both* success ($1M vs $800k) and failure ($200k vs $0) scenarios. This doesn't explain why the Emperor ""immediately accepted"" B's offer as one he ""cannot refuse.""

    *   Therefore, Company A's offer must have been (b) – a fixed price of $800,000 paid to Company A *for the attempt*, meaning the Emperor would pay $800,000 even if Company A failed to build the bridge. Given the ""difficult and dangerous"" nature of the job, this kind of cost-plus or fixed-fee-for-effort contract might have been A's proposal to mitigate *their* risk of losing money on a failure.

    *   Now compare Company B's offer (payments based on outcome) to Company A's likely offer (fixed price for the attempt):
        *   **Worst Case (Failure):** With Company A, the Emperor pays $800,000 and gets no bridge. With Company B, the Emperor pays only $200,000 and gets no bridge. Company B's offer drastically limits the Emperor's financial risk if the project fails.
        *   **Best Case (Success):** With Company A, the Emperor pays $800,000 and gets a bridge. With Company B, the Emperor pays $1,000,000 and gets a bridge. The Emperor pays more for success with B, but the *downside protection* offered by B in case of failure ($200k vs $800k) is immense.

    *   The ""offer you cannot refuse"" was the significant reduction in the Emperor's risk. The Emperor was willing to pay a premium ($1M vs $800k) if the project succeeded, in exchange for only paying a minimal amount ($200k vs $800k) if the project failed. This shows the Emperor was confident in the likelihood of success (perhaps trusting B's higher initial price meant higher quality or capability) and prioritized limiting his losses in the worst-case scenario.

6.  **How Company B Ended Up With $1,000,000:** The riddle states that Company B ""ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job."" Under the terms of the contract they agreed upon, the $1,000,000 payment was for the *successful completion* of the bridge. This means Company B successfully built the bridge as agreed.

7.  **Honesty:** Contractor B was completely honest. He laid out the potential costs based on the project's outcome. The Emperor understood the terms – higher payment for success, much lower payment for failure (and an intermediate payment for partial success) – and freely chose this structure because it significantly protected him financially in the event of a difficult and dangerous project failing. Company B simply delivered successfully and was paid the agreed-upon price for that success.

In essence, Company B's offer wasn't about choosing a price for the service, but about agreeing to a payment structure that allocated the risk of failure primarily to themselves (by accepting a much lower payment in case of failure than A seemingly demanded). This risk mitigation for the Emperor made the offer incredibly attractive, despite the higher potential cost in the success scenario.

Final answer: Company B's offer sounded so good to the Emperor because it significantly reduced the Emperor's financial risk in the event the difficult and dangerous bridge project failed. Company A's offer was likely a fixed price of $800,000 paid regardless of success, meaning the Emperor would pay $800,000 even if no bridge was built. Company B offered a tiered payment structure contingent on the outcome: $200,000 if they completely failed, $750,000 for partial success or issues, and $1,000,000 for successful completion. This meant the Emperor would only pay $200,000 (or $750,000) instead of $800,000 if the project didn't result in a complete bridge, making the potential downside much less severe. The Emperor accepted this offer because the benefit of reduced risk in the failure scenario outweighed the higher cost in the success scenario. Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 because they successfully completed the bridge, triggering the highest payment amount as agreed upon in the contract. Contractor B did not lie or cheat; he offered a payment structure based on potential project outcomes, and Company B achieved the outcome corresponding to the highest payment.",True
58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.

2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"Let $N$ be the number of friends in the group initially.
Let $T$ be the total number of Golden kebab tokens.
Initially, the tokens were divided equally among the $N$ friends. Let $t_f$ be the number of tokens each friend received.
So, $T = N \cdot t_f$.
We are given that $N < 10$. Since it's a group of friends, $N$ must be an integer greater than 1.

Next, a division by families was suggested.
The group of friends consists of:
- Two groups of two sisters (4 friends). These form 2 families.
- Norha Bone (NB), who is not in either group of sisters. She forms her own family. (1 friend, 1 family)
- The rest of the friends, who are unrelated to each other and to the sisters and NB. Let $k$ be the number of these friends. Each of these friends forms their own family. ($k$ friends, $k$ families)

The total number of friends is $N = 4 + 1 + k = 5 + k$. Since $k \ge 0$, $N \ge 5$.
The total number of families is $F = 2 + 1 + k = 3 + k$.
Substituting $k = N-5$, we get $F = 3 + (N-5) = N-2$.

In the re-division by families, the total tokens $T$ would be divided equally among the $F$ families. Let $t_{fam}$ be the number of tokens per family.
So, $T = F \cdot t_{fam}$.
We are told that $t_{fam}$ would be 5 more than $t_f$.
$t_{fam} = t_f + 5$.

Substituting $T = N \cdot t_f$ and $F = N-2$ into $T = F \cdot t_{fam}$:
$N \cdot t_f = (N-2) \cdot (t_f + 5)$
$N t_f = N t_f + 5N - 2t_f - 10$
$0 = 5N - 2t_f - 10$
$2t_f = 5N - 10$
$t_f = \frac{5N - 10}{2}$

Since $t_f$ must be an integer (number of tokens), $5N - 10$ must be an even number. $5(N-2)$ must be even. Since 5 is odd, $N-2$ must be even. This means $N$ must be an even number.

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field

61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.

As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,,True

$S_1$: ""You chose 'True' at most once."" This means $N_T \le 1$.
$S_2$: ""You chose 'False' at most once."" This means $N_F \le 1$.
$S_3$: ""You chose 'True' at most twice."" This means $N_T \le 2$.

$S_9$: ""You chose 'True' at most five times."" This means $N_T \le 5$.
$S_{10}$: ""You chose 'False' at most five times."" This means $N_F \le 5$.

The choices must be consistent. This means that if I choose a statement to be ""True"", then the statement must be true given all my choices. If I choose a statement to be ""False"", then the statement must be false given all my choices.
Let $C_i$ be my choice for statement $S_i$. $C_i$ is ""True"" if $S_i$ is true based on the values of $N_T$ and $N_F$ determined by all choices, and ""False"" if $S_i$ is false.

So, the $i$-th statement is true if and only if I choose ""True"" for the $i$-th statement. This means $N_T$ must be equal to the number of statements that are true.

Let's rephrase the conditions based on $N_T$ (since $N_F = 10 - N_T$):
$S_1$ is true if $N_T \le 1$.
$S_2$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 1 \iff N_T \ge 9$.
$S_3$ is true if $N_T \le 2$.
$S_4$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 2 \iff N_T \ge 8$.
$S_5$ is true if $N_T \le 3$.
$S_6$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 3 \iff N_T \ge 7$.
$S_7$ is true if $N_T \le 4$.
$S_8$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 4 \iff N_T \ge 6$.
$S_9$ is true if $N_T \le 5$.
$S_{10}$ is true if $10 - N_T \le 5 \iff N_T \ge 5$.

Let $T(N_T)$ be the number of statements that are true for a given value of $N_T$. For the choices to be consistent, the number of true statements must equal $N_T$. So we need to find $N_T$ such that $T(N_T) = N_T$.

2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5

2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

79,How is it possible that 3 + 4 = 5?,,"Using VECTORS
i.e. 3 m North + 4 m East
= 5 metres North East
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
9 + 16 = 25
SQ Root of 25 = 5",GeminiFlash,basicprompt,"That's a great question that highlights how mathematical notation can be used in different contexts beyond simple arithmetic!

In standard arithmetic, 3 + 4 always equals 7. So, the statement ""3 + 4 = 5"" is impossible in that context.

However, the equation becomes possible if the symbols ""3"", ""4"", ""+"", or ""5"" represent something different from standard integer values and addition. The most common way this equation makes sense is in the context of **geometry** or **vector addition**, specifically involving a **right triangle**.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Consider a Right Triangle:** Think about a right triangle, which has one angle that measures 90 degrees.
2.  **Sides of a Right Triangle:** The two sides that form the right angle are called the legs, and the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse.
3.  **The Pythagorean Theorem:** For any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs (a and b). This is expressed by the formula: a² + b² = c².
4.  **Applying to 3, 4, and 5:** The numbers 3, 4, and 5 form a well-known Pythagorean triple because they fit this theorem:
    *   Let the lengths of the legs be a = 3 and b = 4.
    *   Calculate the sum of the squares of the legs: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25.
    *   Now, consider the number 5. The square of 5 is 5² = 25.
    *   Since 3² + 4² = 5² (because 25 = 25), a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4 will have a hypotenuse of length 5.

5.  **Relating to ""3 + 4 = 5"":**
    *   Imagine the '+' symbol in the equation ""3 + 4 = 5"" doesn't mean arithmetic sum, but rather the *combination* or *composition* of quantities that are oriented at a right angle.
    *   Think of adding displacements: If you travel 3 units in one direction (say, East) and then 4 units in a direction perpendicular to the first (say, North), your final displacement from the starting point is not 3 + 4 = 7 units in a straight line. Instead, the path taken forms the two legs of a right triangle. The straight-line distance (magnitude of the total displacement) from your start to your end point is the length of the hypotenuse.
    *   Using the Pythagorean theorem for this 3-unit leg and 4-unit leg, the hypotenuse has a length of √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5.
    *   In this context, where '+' represents the combination of orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors or displacements, the ""sum"" of a 3-unit displacement and a 4-unit displacement is a resultant displacement with a magnitude of 5 units.

So, the equation 3 + 4 = 5 is possible when:

*   '3' and '4' represent the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle.
*   '+' represents the geometric combination of these legs (resulting in the hypotenuse).
*   '5' represents the length of the hypotenuse.

Or, more generally:

*   '3' and '4' represent the magnitudes of two vectors.
*   '+' represents vector addition.
*   '5' represents the magnitude of the resultant vector, specifically when the two original vectors are perpendicular.

Final answer: It is possible that 3 + 4 = 5 if the numbers 3, 4, and 5 represent the lengths of the sides of a right triangle (legs 3 and 4, hypotenuse 5), and the '+' symbol represents the geometric combination of the two legs to form the hypotenuse, as described by the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²). This is also equivalent to adding two perpendicular vectors of magnitudes 3 and 4, resulting in a vector with magnitude 5.",True

The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.

From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
