{"ID": 1, "Question": "Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, \"You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.\n\"In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.\n\"After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.\"\n\"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.\"\n\"But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'\n\"If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.\"\n*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.\n Your Solution: 1.        Appoint a \"scorekeeper\" and the other 22 prisoners as \"transmitters\".\n2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.\n3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.\n Correct Solution: Strategy the prisoners agree on during their one-time meeting\n\n1. Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.\n\n2. Decide that  \n   \u2022 switch A will be the counting switch,  \n   \u2022 switch B is just a \u201cdummy\u2019\u2019 switch that can be flipped any time a prisoner is forced to move some switch but does not want to change the value of A.\n\n   The warden has told them that both switches are now OFF, so everybody knows the initial state.\n\nRules each prisoner follows later\n\nCOUNTER\u2019S RULES  \n\u2022 He keeps in his memory a number Count, initially 0.  \n\u2022 Every time he is taken to the switch room\n\n    \u2013 If switch A is ON, he flips A to OFF and sets  \n      Count \u2190 Count + 1.  \n\n    \u2013 If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B (so that he does satisfy the \u201cmust flip exactly one switch\u2019\u2019 rule).\n\n\u2022 Whenever Count reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  \n  \u201cAll of us have visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nNON-COUNTER\u2019S RULES  \nEach non-counter remembers a personal flag called Signalled, initially FALSE.\n\nWhen he is taken to the switch room he does the following.\n\n    \u2013 If Signalled = FALSE and switch A is OFF  \n      (that is, he has never succeeded in signalling before and A is currently OFF)  \n      * flip switch A from OFF to ON, and  \n      * set Signalled \u2190 TRUE.  \n      (This is his one and only contribution to the count.)\n\n    \u2013 Otherwise  \n      flip switch B (again, just to comply with the \u201cmust flip one switch\u2019\u2019 rule).\n\nWhy the strategy works\n\n1. Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).\n\n2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.\n\n3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.\n\n4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random \u201cindefinitely\u2019\u2019 (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.\n\n5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter\u2019s declaration is certainly true.\n\n6. Premature declaration is impossible:  \n   \u2022 For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  \n   \u2022 A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  \n   \u2022 That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  \n   \u2022 A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  \n   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.\n\nConsequently the counter\u2019s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.\n\nFinal answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF\u2192ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON\u2192OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.", "Hint": "Assuming that:\nA) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.\nB) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room\nC) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.", "Human Solution": "1.

Consequently the basic idea is sound.  \nThe differences between your write-up and a fully correct description are only matters of precision and completeness, not of fundamental logic.  Those small imprecisions, however, leave room for behaviours that would ruin the guarantee of safety, so they have to be fixed.\n\n1.  Ambiguity about what a transmitter is allowed to do with switch B after he has already \u201csent his signal\u201d.  \n    \u2022  You write that after a transmitter has once found an opportunity to flip B from OFF to ON, \u201che will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.\u201d  \n    \u2022  You never say explicitly that he must never again move B.  \n       If, by mistake, such a transmitter were to encounter B in the ON position and flip it back to OFF, the score-keeper would later flip it OFF once more (even though it is already OFF) and would add one to his count.  That would give a double count and would let him reach 22 too early.  \n       The correct solution prevents this by stating unambiguously that a non-counter (your \u201ctransmitter\u201d) touches the counting switch at most once in his life; afterwards he always flips the dummy switch.  \n       Add the sentence \u201cFrom then on he must never again touch switch B.\u201d\n\n2.  Failure to state that transmitters have to remember whether they have already signalled.  \n    The rule \u201cwaits for his next visit\u201d implicitly requires a memory bit, but you never say so.  \n    Without that bit a transmitter might forget that he has already completed his task and could try to flip B from OFF to ON a second time, again creating an over-count.  \n    In the correct description every non-counter keeps an explicit Boolean variable Signalled.\n\n3.  What the score-keeper does when B is already OFF.  \n    You say he \u201cflicks switch A instead.\u201d  You do not say whether by doing this he may accidentally turn A into a second counting switch.  \n    Although your intention is clearly to use A purely as a dummy, spell this out:  \n       \u201cThe score-keeper never moves switch B from OFF to ON, and nobody except the score-keeper ever moves B from ON to OFF.\u201d\n\n4.  Proof of eventual success is missing.  \n    A correct solution has to argue that every transmitter is sure to encounter the room while B is OFF sooner or later.  \n    Your solution does not give that argument.  It is true, but it needs to be said explicitly (as items 4\u20136 in the official solution).\n\n5.  No statement that everybody knows the initial state.  \n    Your procedure works only because everyone is told that both switches start OFF; you did not mention this prerequisite.\n\nTo sum up:  with those clarifications added, your algorithm is the same as the official one except that you have swapped the roles of the two switches, which is perfectly fine.  As written, however, the un-stated assumptions in items 1\u20133 leave loopholes that could lead to double counting and to a premature (and fatal) declaration. ", "Status": true}
{"ID": 1, "Question": "Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, \"You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.\n\"In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.\n\"After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.\"\n\"No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.\"\n\"But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'\n\"If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.\"\n*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.\n Your Solution: Strategy the prisoners agree on during their one-time meeting\n\n1. Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.\n\n2. Decide that  \n   \u2022 switch A will be the counting switch,  \n   \u2022 switch B is just a \u201cdummy\u2019\u2019 switch that can be flipped any time a prisoner is forced to move some switch but does not want to change the value of A.\n\n   The warden has told them that both switches are now OFF, so everybody knows the initial state.\n\nRules each prisoner follows later\n\nCOUNTER\u2019S RULES  \n\u2022 He keeps in his memory a number Count, initially 0.  \n\u2022 Every time he is taken to the switch room\n\n    \u2013 If switch A is ON, he flips A to OFF and sets  \n      Count \u2190 Count + 1.  \n\n    \u2013 If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B (so that he does satisfy the \u201cmust flip exactly one switch\u2019\u2019 rule).\n\n\u2022 Whenever Count reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  \n  \u201cAll of us have visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nNON-COUNTER\u2019S RULES  \nEach non-counter remembers a personal flag called Signalled, initially FALSE.\n\nWhen he is taken to the switch room he does the following.\n\n    \u2013 If Signalled = FALSE and switch A is OFF  \n      (that is, he has never succeeded in signalling before and A is currently OFF)  \n      * flip switch A from OFF to ON, and  \n      * set Signalled \u2190 TRUE.  \n      (This is his one and only contribution to the count.)\n\n    \u2013 Otherwise  \n      flip switch B (again, just to comply with the \u201cmust flip one switch\u2019\u2019 rule).\n\nWhy the strategy works\n\n1. Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).\n\n2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.\n\n3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.\n\n4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random \u201cindefinitely\u2019\u2019 (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.\n\n5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter\u2019s declaration is certainly true.\n\n6. Premature declaration is impossible:  \n   \u2022 For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  \n   \u2022 A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  \n   \u2022 That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  \n   \u2022 A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  \n   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.\n\nConsequently the counter\u2019s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.\n\nFinal answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF\u2192ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON\u2192OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.\n Correct Solution: 1.        Appoint a \"scorekeeper\" and the other 22 prisoners as \"transmitters\".\n2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.\n3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.

Primality conditions (item 10)  \n   \u2022 The two-digit numbers FE, HC and JA do not exist, so they cannot be prime.\n\nTherefore the answer fails every explicit constraint.\n\nWhy the correct answer 5736912480 works  \n(Outlined in the official solution you were given.)\n\nSpecific logical gaps in your work\n\n\u2022 No attempt to translate the verbal conditions into algebraic or modular constraints.  \n\u2022 No exploitation of the \u201cIJ is a multiple of 10\u201d clue, which forces J = 0 and makes the problem much easier.  \n\u2022 No use of parity considerations (even/odd) coming from the multiples of 2, 4, 8, 10 clues.  \n\u2022 No use of divisibility by 3 and 9 via digit sums.  \n\u2022 No systematic elimination of impossible two-digit candidates for AB, CD, EF, GH, IJ.  \n\u2022 No attention to the primality constraint on FE, HC, JA.  \n\u2022 In short, no reasoning path at all: the answer \u201cnan\u201d indicates the algorithm or reasoning process never produced a candidate.\n\nMissed edge cases / pitfalls the correct solution has to address\n\n1. Leading-zero prohibition: IJ = 10k forces J = 0 but still allows A \u2260 0.  \n2. The \u201cprime\u201d condition with a leading 0 (JA = 05) still counts as the prime 5.  \n3. EF must be 91, the only remaining two-digit multiple of 7 with distinct unused digits satisfying the primality restriction on FE.  \n4. GH must be 24 because 24 is the only unused multiple of 8 with distinct digits once other placements are fixed.  \n5. Only the pair of sums (30, 15) can partition the global digit sum 45 into multiples of 6 and 5, respectively.  \n6. Only the pair of sums (27, 18) can partition 45 into a multiple of 9 and an even number.\n\nBecause your answer never progressed to these subtleties, every one of them was missed.\n\nHow to avoid this kind of error\n\n\u2022 Begin by extracting the immediate forced digits (e.g., J = 0).  \n\u2022 Use divisibility rules systematically (sum of digits for 3, 9; last two digits for 4; last three digits for 8; etc.).  \n\u2022 Keep a running list of remaining digits and allowable pairs to satisfy two-digit multiple clues.  \n\u2022 Constantly cross-check partial assignments against all outstanding conditions to prune the search space.\n\nImplementing even a simple back-tracking search with these constraints would quickly converge to the unique solution 5736912480, whereas supplying \u201cnan\u201d indicates the search failed or was never executed.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 5, "Question": "Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Your Solution: The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.

{"ID": 6, "Question": "Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Your Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\n Correct Solution: nan", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16.

This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj].

Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.\nAfter dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.\nIn this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.\nCan you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?\nPlayers: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon\nRaces: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre\nOccupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief\nWeapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace\nMonsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs\nSkill levels: range from 10-32\nClues:\n1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.\n2. The paladin isn't an elf.\n3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.\n4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.\n5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.\n6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.\n7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).\n8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.\n9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.\n10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Your Solution: nan\n Correct Solution: Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16.

Eliminating the language barrier  \n   \u2022 A correct strategy must work even though you do not know whether ja means yes or no.  \n   \u2022 This is achieved by embedding the word you-will-say in the question itself (\u201cIf I were to ask you \u2026 would you say ja?\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Your solution does not contain any mechanism for overcoming the ja/da ambiguity.\n\n2. Dealing with the Random god  \n   \u2022 Random may answer arbitrarily, so the first priority is to find at least one god who is definitely not Random.  \n   \u2022 The standard trick is to ask one god a question whose truth value refers to a different god (\u201cIs the god on your left Random?\u201d) and to wrap it in the language-fixing hypothetical above.  \n   \u2022 Your solution gives no method at all for isolating or identifying Random.\n\n3. Economy of questions (exactly three)  \n   \u2022 The puzzle forces you to succeed in no more than three yes/no questions.  \n   \u2022 A correct solution lays out exactly which god is addressed in Q1, Q2, and Q3, and why those three questions suffice.  \n   \u2022 Because your answer is empty, you never show how three questions would be enough.\n\n4. Distinguishing True from False once Random is eliminated  \n   \u2022 After you have a non-Random god you still must tell whether he is the truth-teller or the liar.  \n   \u2022 This is done with the same hypothetical form: \u201cIf I were to ask you whether you are True, would you say ja?\u201d  \n   \u2022 Again, your solution provides nothing for this step.\n\n5.

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.\n5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.\n Your Solution: Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).\nThe Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).\nMad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.

(2)\nAdams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.\nMad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel.

These are the weaknesses that would make your answer vulnerable if the intended solution were different.\n\n1. \u201cIN NOBLE GASES\u201d really is hidden in the P.S., but the instruction is ambiguous.  \n   \u2022 It might mean \u201clook inside (\u2018in\u2019) the names of the noble gases\u201d,  \n   \u2022 or \u201chide something inside symbols of the noble gases\u201d,  \n   \u2022 or \u201cwrite something using only letters that belong to noble-gas symbols\u201d,  \n   \u2022 or even \u201ctake the letters that lie between two different noble-gas symbols\u201d.  \n   Your solution commits to only one of those readings (the \u2018letter between the two-letter symbol\u2019 idea) without proving that the other interpretations fail or produce gibberish.  \n   If any other interpretation leads to a cleaner or more thematically relevant answer, yours would be wrong.\n\n2. Six lines vs. seven noble gases.  \n   Modern chemistry recognises seven noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn, Og).  \n   You use only six of them, because there are only six storyline lines before the post-script.  \n   That is a small inconsistency: a setter who wanted chemical completeness would have supplied a seventh line or an explicit hint that Oganesson was to be ignored.  \n   If the puzzle author intended Og to participate (for example by hiding the final letter of the password) your method would miss it.\n\n3. Non-unique placement of symbols.  \n   In several of the words there are other partial matches that could be chosen just as legitimately.  \n   Example:  \n      \u2022 tOuGHNEss actually contains HE twice \u2013 H \u2026 E and H E (adjacent).  \n      \u2022 biKERs contains the contiguous sequence \u201cKr\u201d (your choice), but also \u2018He\u2019 if you wrap-round or look at the whole line (\u201cshe joined a band of bikers\u201d).  \n   The fact that several different noble-gas symbols can be forced into the same word means the set of \u2018between\u2019 letters is not provably unique.  A different, equally plausible set of picks could yield a different six-letter result and therefore a different password.\n\n4. The \u201cbetween the letters\u201d constraint is never stated.  \n   Nothing in \u201cA relative of mine was expelled\u201d etc. tells the solver to take the letter between the two letters that make up a chemical symbol.  \n   A common alternative steganographic device is \u201ctake the letter immediately after / before the symbol\u201d, \u201ctake the first letter of the word after a symbol\u201d, etc.  \n   Without an explicit cue, the \u2018between-letters\u2019 extraction is one arbitrary choice among many possibilities.\n\n5. Narrative/thematic confirmation is weak.  \n   A good puzzle answer is usually confirmed by the story.  \u201cPIGEON\u201d has no direct link to nieces, bikers, toughness, or even to Isaac Newton.  Yes, a pigeon can carry a message, but nothing in the narrative specifically nods toward pigeons (no mention of birds, cooing, rooftops, breadcrumbs, etc.).  \n   If a different word (e.g., \u201cCARRIER\u201d or \u201cCOURIER\u201d) happened to fit an alternative extraction and tied in more cleanly with spycraft, that would look more convincing than \u201cPIGEON\u201d.\n\n6. Capitalisation/order fidelity.  \n   Chemical symbols are case-sensitive and contiguous.  Your solution lets the letters be separated by one intervening character and ignores case.  A stricter solver might insist on \u201cXe\u201d occurring exactly as X followed immediately by e.  \u201cexpelled\u201d does not contain \u201cXe\u201d consecutively or in the correct case, so a chemist/setter might reject that occurrence outright.\n\n7. No use of the duplicated initial \u201cIN\u201d.  \n   The first three P.S.-acrostic letters are I-N-N, not I-N.  Your explanation silently discards the second N.  That dangling letter may actually be meaningful and point to a different extraction rule (e.g., \u201cINN \u2013 look inside, inside, inside \u2026\u201d).\n\n8. No final transformation step.  \n   A great many puzzle passwords require one last manipulation (reversal, Caesar shift, keyword substitution, anagram, etc.).  \n   You stop as soon as you read PIGEON.  If the setter expected \u201cCARRIERPIGEON\u201d, \u201cPIDGEON\u201d (spy Odette Sansom\u2019s codename), or some other conversion, your answer is short by at least one step.\n\nSummary of likely errors/omissions in your solution\n\u2022 Took one possible reading of \u201cIN NOBLE GASES\u201d and treated it as the only correct one.  \n\u2022 Ignored the seventh noble gas (Og).  \n\u2022 Relied on non-unique, non-contiguous letter matches; other equally valid matches produce different letters.  \n\u2022 The \u2018between-letters\u2019 rule is invented, not clued.  \n\u2022 Narrative confirmation is weak; nothing in the story screams \u201cpigeon\u201d.  \n\u2022 Dropped an extra N from the acrostic.  \n\u2022 Did not check for or perform a potential final transformation of the six-letter result.\n\nAny one of those issues would make the answer \u201cPIGEON\u201d uncertain; taken together they cast serious doubt on it unless an official solution confirms it.", "Status": true}

He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.

A contradictory statement in the elimination chain  \n   \u2022 Step M of your elimination reads  \n        \u201cG must be 5.  C cannot be 5.  G cannot be 5.\u201d  \n     The first and the third sentences conflict.  The third sentence should have been deleted once you had concluded that G has to be 5.

No final value \u2013 search terminated as \u201cimpossible\u201d  \n   \u2022 By stopping with \u201cnan\u201d you implicitly concluded that the system of constraints has no solution (or that the solver did not find one).  \n   \u2022 The official answer proves that at least one valid assignment exists, so the search / reasoning contained blocking errors.\n\n2. Wrong (or missing) exclusivity test inside every clue  \n   \u2022 Each clue is an exclusive OR: the digit must belong to exactly one of the two categories that are mentioned.  \n   \u2022 If you merely checked \u201cbelongs to at least one category\u201d you allowed digits that actually belong to both, which invalidates later steps and quickly leads to dead ends.\n\n3. Mis-classification of 0  \n   a. Cube / square / triangular   \n      \u2013 0 = 0\u00b3 so it is a cube.  \n      \u2013 Most elementary-school definitions of triangular numbers start with 1, so 0 is usually not regarded as triangular.  \n      \u2013 Likewise many contest problems consider 0 neither a positive square nor a positive triangle unless explicitly stated.  \n   b. Impact on the puzzle  \n      \u2013 With the official convention \u201c0 is a cube but NOT a triangle or a square\u201d the digit 0 fits perfectly in clue 3 (cube XOR triangle).  \n      \u2013 If you treated 0 as both a square and a triangular number, you ruled it out for clue 3 and destroyed the only arrangement that satisfies all the inequalities (C must be the unique 0).\n\n4. Mis-classification of 1  \n   \u2022 1 is NOT prime, but it is odd, square (1\u00b2), cube (1\u00b3) and triangular (T\u2081).  \n   \u2022 The unique place where 1 can legally go is position G (\u201codd XOR prime\u201d \u21d2 odd but not prime).  \n   \u2022 If you regarded 1 as prime you would exclude it from position G and again make the instance unsatisfiable.\n\n5. Treating global properties as forbidden instead of local  \n   \u2022 A common mistake is to demand that a digit belong to at most one of the six families (square / cube / triangular / even / odd / prime) overall.  \n   \u2022 The statement only limits the pair that appears in the **same** clue.  \n     Example: 6 can be used at B (even XOR cube) because it is even and not a cube, even though 6 is also triangular \u2013 \u201ctriangular\u201d is irrelevant to clue 2.\n\n6. Dropping \u201cno leading 0\u201d too early  \n   \u2022 You did respect \u201cno leading 0\u201d, but if you simultaneously forbid 0 in any ambiguous family (see point 3) the search space collapses incorrectly and you end up with none of the remaining digits satisfying the chain of inequalities.\n\n7. Not exploiting the inequality chain and the half-sum condition  \n   \u2022  A<B, C<D, E<F, G<H, I<J, plus the half-sum inequality, fixes the order almost completely once the category exclusivity is applied.  \n   \u2022  When these filters are used in the right order, only one permutation survives: 3-6-0-5-8-9-1-2-4-7.  \n   \u2022  Evidently your algorithm either never reached this propagation stage or discarded some candidates prematurely because of the earlier classification errors.\n\nSummary of the critical definitional corrections you needed:\n\nSquares (positive only) : 1,4,9  \nCubes (non-negative)    : 0,1,8  \nTriangular (positive)   : 1,3,6  \nPrimes                  : 2,3,5,7  \nEven                    : 0,2,4,6,8  \nOdd                     : 1,3,5,7,9  \n\nWith those exact sets and strict XOR inside each clue all constraints are simultaneously satisfied by\n\nA=3 B=6 C=0 D=5 E=8 F=9 G=1 H=2 I=4 J=7  \u2192 3605891247.\n\nMis-defining 0 or 1, forgetting the XOR condition, or applying cross-clue restrictions caused your search to conclude incorrectly, giving the empty result \u201cnan\u201d.", "Status": true}

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.\n Your Solution: From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5.

{"ID": 19, "Question": "Question: Zachary has a private zoo.  He has five groups of animals in his zoo:  snakes, birds, mammals, insects, and spiders.  Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.  From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.\n1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.\n2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.\n3) The most populous group has 10 more members than the least populous group.\n4) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs.\n5) There are as many snake heads as there are spider heads.\n Your Solution: A) Since there are 3 extra heads (2 snake and 1 bird), there are only 97 animals (clue 1).  Find a set of five different numbers whose sum is 97 (clue 2) and whose size difference between the least populous and most populous group is 10 (clue 3).  There are 17 sets that meet these requirements.\n13, 18, 21, 22, 23\n13, 19, 20, 22, 23\n14, 15, 21, 23, 24\n14, 16, 20, 23, 24\n14, 16, 21, 22, 24\n14, 17, 19, 23, 24\n14, 17, 20, 22, 24\n14, 18, 19, 22, 24\n14, 18, 20, 21, 24\n15, 16, 17, 24, 25\n15, 16, 18, 23, 25\n15, 16, 19, 22, 25\n15, 16, 20, 21, 25\n15, 17, 18, 22, 25\n15, 17, 19, 21, 25\n15, 18, 19, 20, 25\n16, 17, 18, 20, 26\nB) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.\n((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds\n((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds\n((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds\nOf the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.\n13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)\n15, 16, 17, 24, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)\n15, 16, 19, 22, 25 (15 insects & 22 birds)\n15, 17, 18, 22, 25 (15 insects & 22 birds or 17 insects & 25 birds)\n15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)\nC) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.\n13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals\n15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds\nD) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.\n(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs\n(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs\n19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs\n(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs\n25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs\nThus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Your Solution: Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car.

I never verified that only one statement was false after I chose Mr K  \n   In the arrangement I ended with, both Mr G and Mr Q (and, because of the victim,\n   sometimes Ms W) are also lying, so my solution violates the \u201clone murderer\u201d rule.\n\nWhat I missed / should have checked\n\n\u2022  Always include the victim in seat-count statements.  \n\u2022  Do not assume particular people must be telling the truth; test each witness in turn\n   as the possible single liar.  \n\u2022  Honour the exact wording of every statement (F and R must, not may, be in opposite\n   cars).  \n\u2022  After selecting a candidate liar, re-check every other sentence to be sure it now\n   reads true.\n\nCorrect conclusion  \n\nOnly Mr G\u2019s statement cannot be made true together with the other nine;\ntherefore Mr G is the sole liar and Detective Y arrests Mr G.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Your Solution: nan\n Correct Solution: Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise.

{"ID": 22, "Question": "Question: The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, \"white\" can mean \"my mother did my laundry\" and \"black\" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.\n Your Solution: Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer \"white\" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.\n Correct Solution: Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1.  What can the last person (call him P10) transmit?  \n    \u2013 He is allowed to utter exactly one of two words, \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d.  \n    \u2013 Therefore he can convey at most one single binary bit of information to the other nine people.  \n\n2.  Why can we not guarantee that all 10 survive?  \n    \u2013 The unknown configuration of hats is a 10-bit string (each hat = 0 for black, 1 for white).  \n    \u2013 Everybody except P10 sees at most 9 of those bits.  \n    \u2013 Only one additional bit (the one word said by P10) can be added to what the others already see.  \n    \u2013 A single bit is insufficient to distinguish all 10 possibilities for P10\u2019s own hat colour, so P10 cannot be sure of saving himself.  \n    \u2013 Hence, at best 9 of them can be saved with certainty, and that is the optimum we must aim for.\n\n3.  A one-bit message that lets the other 9 deduce their own colours.  \n    \u2013 The most familiar one-bit property of a set of binary digits is \u201cparity\u201d, i.e. whether the number of 1\u2019s is even or odd.  \n    \u2013 Plan: encode the parity of white hats P10 sees.  \n\n4.  The convention agreed upon during the night  \n    \u2022 \u201cwhite\u201d uttered by P10 means:  \u201cThe number of white hats I (P10) can see is EVEN.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201cblack\u201d uttered by P10 means:  \u201cThe number of white hats I can see is ODD.\u201d  \n    (Any other fixed assignment of the two words to the two parities would work equally well; this one is just explicit.)\n\n5.  How the daytime play proceeds  \n\n    P10 (sees 9 hats).  \n       \u2013 Counts the white hats in front of him.  \n       \u2013 Announces \u201cwhite\u201d if that count is even, otherwise \u201cblack\u201d.  \n       \u2013 He survives with probability \u00bd (he does not know his own colour) but has now broadcast the parity bit.\n\n    P9 (sees 8 hats).  \n       \u2013 He has heard the announced parity and he sees the colours of P1\u2013P8.  \n       \u2013 Let W be the number of white hats he sees.  \n       \u2013 If announced parity = \u201ceven\u201d and W is even, then his own hat must be black; if announced parity = \u201ceven\u201d and W is odd, his hat must be white.  \n       \u2013 If announced parity = \u201codd\u201d, reverse the conclusion.  \n       \u2013 He says the deduced colour and is guaranteed to be correct.  \n       \u2013 Before P8 is addressed, everyone still alive recomputes the new \u201crunning parity\u201d by flipping it whenever someone just announced \u201cwhite\u201d.  (Operationally easier: Pk simply remembers what has already been said and what he still sees; the algebra works out.)\n\n    P8, P7, \u2026 , P1 proceed identically:  \n       \u2013 Each of them knows the original parity bit and has heard all answers between P10 and himself, so he can compute the parity of the unseen hats that still remain.  \n       \u2013 Comparing that with what he actually sees, he infers his own colour with certainty.\n\n6.  Verification by an example  \n\n    Suppose the true hat line (from P10 at the back to P1 at the front) is  \n          W  B  B  W  W  B  W  B  B  W  \n          10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  \n\n    \u2022 P10 sees eight whites?  Count = 5 whites (odd) \u2192 says \u201cblack\u201d (odd parity).  \n    \u2022 P9 hears \u201codd\u201d, sees 4 whites (even) \u21d2 must himself be white \u2192 says \u201cwhite\u201d, lives.  \n    \u2022 P8 now knows current parity should be \u201codd XOR white\u2010said\u201d = even, sees 3 whites (odd) \u21d2 he is white \u2192 speaks, lives.  \n      \u2026 and so on; everyone down to P1 determines the colour correctly.\n\n7.  Optimality proof  \n\n    \u2022 Because the first spoken word can carry only one bit of information, any deterministic protocol must leave P10 with at least two equally possible colours consistent with what he sees and the message he is constrained to give.  Therefore his survival probability can never exceed \u00bd.  \n    \u2022 Once P10\u2019s word is fixed, the remaining nine people together see nine hats plus the one-bit message, i.e. the entire information needed to deduce their own colours uniquely.  So the above protocol, which indeed guarantees perfect knowledge for the remaining nine, is optimal.\n\nConclusion  \nThe best achievable strategy guarantees the survival of 9 out of the 10 islanders; the very last person in line survives with probability \u00bd.  The concrete protocol is:\n\nLast person: say \u201cwhite\u201d if you see an even number of white hats, \u201cblack\u201d otherwise.  \nEach subsequent person: knowing the original parity and what has been said so far, compare it with the parity of white hats you still see; speak the only colour that makes parities match.\n\nFinal answer: 9 people are guaranteed to live; the strategy is that the last person encodes the parity (even/odd) of white hats he sees with the word \u201cwhite\u201d/\u201cblack\u201d, and everyone after him uses that bit together with what they observe to deduce and announce their own hat colour with certainty.", "Hint": "1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.\n2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.", "Human Solution": "Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees.

What exactly is the bit that is being transmitted?  \n    \u2022 The correct solution fixes one and the same predicate for both possible utterances, e.g.  \n        \u2003\u2003\u201cwhite\u201d  \u2194  number of white hats in front of me is EVEN,  \n        \u2003\u2003\u201cblack\u201d  \u2194  number of white hats in front of me is ODD.  \n      Everybody therefore knows that the single piece of information that is being\n      carried forward is \u201cparity-of-WHITE\u2019\u2019.  \n\n    \u2022 In your text you say  \n\n        \u2003\u2003\u201cblack\u2019\u2019   \u2194  odd number of BLACK hats,  \n        \u2003\u2003\u201cwhite\u2019\u2019   \u2194  odd number of WHITE hats.\n\n      These are *two different* predicates.  \n      For ten people the last man sees exactly nine hats, i.e. an odd total.\n      Consequently exactly one of the two predicates is true, so you still only\n      transmit one bit \u2013 but nothing in the night-time agreement tells the people in\n      front *which* predicate is the one that is to be maintained during the rest of\n      the game.  \n      (For an audience of 8, 12, \u2026 people the last man would sometimes see an even\n      total of hats and then both predicates could be true or both false, making\n      the first word ambiguous and the scheme collapse.)\n\n2.  How do the others update the \u201crunning parity\u2019\u2019?  \n    \u2022 The correct solution explicitly tells every subsequent speaker how to update the\n      parity information after each answer (\u201cflip it whenever someone has just said\n      \u2018white\u2019 \u2019\u2019 or keep track of the answers already given).  \n    \u2022 Your description only says that P8, P7, \u2026 can \u201ceasily incorporate\u2019\u2019 what has\n      happened so far; no precise rule is stated.  If the only parity information that\n      was agreed on is \u201codd black\u2019\u2019 versus \u201codd white\u2019\u2019 this is *not* enough to let the\n      remaining people derive the colour of their own hats uniquely \u2014 a concrete\n      update rule has to be stipulated.\n\n3.  Superfluous doubling of information  \n    Because \u201codd black\u2019\u2019 and \u201codd white\u2019\u2019 are mutually exclusive for nine hats, using\n    the two different sentences to refer to two different parities is an unnecessary\n    complication.  It becomes dangerous if the monster notices that sometimes the\n    same physical situation is reported with \u201cwhite\u2019\u2019 and sometimes with \u201cblack\u2019\u2019\n    (which would reveal that the word is hidden code), violating condition 2 of the\n    statement.  Saying that both words are merely the two values (0/1) of one and\n    the same logical quantity avoids this suspicion.\n\n4.  General-n mistake  \n    Your protocol only accidentally works when the last person happens to see an odd\n    number of hats (which he does for 10 players, but not for every possible group\n    size).  The official solution works for any number of players because it always\n    refers to a single, well-defined parity.\n\nSummary of the errors\n\n\u2022 You did not commit to a *single* \u201cparity of white\u2019\u2019 (or of black) bit; instead you\n  switched between two different parities, which leaves the protocol underspecified\n  for the remaining players and fails for other group sizes.  \n\u2022 You omitted an explicit update rule that tells each subsequent person how to use\n  the previously spoken answers together with what he sees.  \n\u2022 Because of the ambiguity, the monster could in principle detect that the words\n  carry hidden meaning, breaking assumption 2.\n\nOnce one fixes those points (choose one parity predicate and explain the running\nupdate), the strategy becomes identical to the official one and guarantees that the\nfront nine players survive while the back player lives with probability \u00bd.", "Status": true}

Count = 5 whites (odd) \u2192 says \u201cblack\u201d (odd parity).  \n    \u2022 P9 hears \u201codd\u201d, sees 4 whites (even) \u21d2 must himself be white \u2192 says \u201cwhite\u201d, lives.  \n    \u2022 P8 now knows current parity should be \u201codd XOR white\u2010said\u201d = even, sees 3 whites (odd) \u21d2 he is white \u2192 speaks, lives.  \n      \u2026 and so on; everyone down to P1 determines the colour correctly.\n\n7.  Optimality proof  \n\n    \u2022 Because the first spoken word can carry only one bit of information, any deterministic protocol must leave P10 with at least two equally possible colours consistent with what he sees and the message he is constrained to give.  Therefore his survival probability can never exceed \u00bd.  \n    \u2022 Once P10\u2019s word is fixed, the remaining nine people together see nine hats plus the one-bit message, i.e. the entire information needed to deduce their own colours uniquely.  So the above protocol, which indeed guarantees perfect knowledge for the remaining nine, is optimal.\n\nConclusion  \nThe best achievable strategy guarantees the survival of 9 out of the 10 islanders; the very last person in line survives with probability \u00bd.  The concrete protocol is:\n\nLast person: say \u201cwhite\u201d if you see an even number of white hats, \u201cblack\u201d otherwise.  \nEach subsequent person: knowing the original parity and what has been said so far, compare it with the parity of white hats you still see; speak the only colour that makes parities match.\n\nFinal answer: 9 people are guaranteed to live; the strategy is that the last person encodes the parity (even/odd) of white hats he sees with the word \u201cwhite\u201d/\u201cblack\u201d, and everyone after him uses that bit together with what they observe to deduce and announce their own hat colour with certainty.\n Correct Solution: Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer \"white\" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.", "Hint": "1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.\n2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.", "Human Solution": "Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees.

Details are below.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Wrong count in the worked example (Step 6)  \n Configuration you wrote (from the rear, #10, to the front, #1)  \n  \n     10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  \n      W  B  B  W  W  B  W  B  B  W  \n\n White hats that #10 sees are those on 9\u20261.  \nThey are on positions 7, 6, 4 and 1 \u2013 only four of them, i.e. an EVEN\nnumber.  \nNevertheless you state:\n\n     \u201cCount = 5 whites (odd) \u2192 says \u2018black\u2019 (odd parity).\u201d\n\nThe count is wrong (it is 4, not 5), so #10 should have said \u201cwhite\u201d\naccording to your own convention (\u201cwhite\u201d \u2194 even).  \nEverything that follows in the example (\u201cP9 hears \u2018odd\u2019 \u2026\u201d) is therefore out\nof step with the actual hat configuration.  The arithmetic inside the\nexample is self-consistent, but it is not the situation that would really\noccur.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  Inversion of the parity code  \nThe official solution chooses\n\n     \u201cblack\u201d  = \u201codd number of black hats ahead\u201d  \n     \u201cwhite\u201d  = \u201codd number of white hats ahead\u201d.\n\nYou chose\n\n     \u201cwhite\u201d  = \u201ceven number of white hats ahead\u201d  \n     \u201cblack\u201d  = \u201codd number of white hats ahead\u201d.\n\nThis is not wrong \u2013 any fixed, agreed mapping of the two words to the two\npossible parities works \u2013 but it is the opposite of the mapping used in the\nreference solution, so a reader who compares the two texts line by line may\nthink a contradiction exists.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Description of the \u201crunning parity\u201d  \nYou say that after each answer everyone \u201cflips the running parity whenever\nsomeone has just announced \u2018white\u2019 \u201d.  \nThat works only because under your scheme the word that is spoken is always\nthe real colour of the speaker\u2019s hat (for #9 \u2026 #1).  The reference solution\nexplains it the other way round: after every correct answer the new speaker\nsimply subtracts the colour he can now account for from the original parity\nstatement.  Your description is equivalent, but the reason it is valid\nshould have been spelt out explicitly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  No substantive logical gap  \nApart from the numerical slip in the example and the minor explanatory\nissues just mentioned, your solution is logically sound:\n\n\u2022 It achieves the optimum (nine certain survivors, #10 survives with\n probability \u00bd).  \n\u2022 It proves that no deterministic strategy can do better for #10 than that\n \u00bd-probability.  \n\u2022 It respects all the restrictions in the problem statement.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary of the errors\n\n1.  Miscounted the number of white hats in the illustrative example; this\n    makes the example inconsistent with the algorithm.  \n2.  Used the opposite mapping of the two words to the two parities compared\n    with the reference answer (not fatal, but worth noting).  \n3.  Skimmed over the justification for the \u201cflip-the-parity-when-white-is-\n    said\u201d rule.\n\nCorrect those points and your write-up is fully aligned with the official\nsolution.", "Status": true}

You assumed that SNOWY is a stallion and exactly four years old, although\n   neither the sex nor the age of SNOWY appears anywhere in the poem.  \n   \u2022  The only fact we are given about the losing horse\u2019s sex is that it was \u201ctheir\n     stallion\u201d; the poem never connects the word \u201cstallion\u201d with the white\n     horse.  \n   \u2022  By imposing \u200b\u201cmale, four-year-old\u201d on SNOWY you excluded the possibility\n     that another male horse\u2014namely the remaining brown one\u2014could be the\n     stallion in question.\n\n4.

Without that assumption the whole chain disappears.\n\nSummary of the correct reasoning you missed\n\n1. Two browns on the farm; one is the 3-year-old BILLY, so the other brown is\n   older than three.\n2. Last year\u2019s entrant is four now (because Derby horses are three in the year\n   they run).\n3. Therefore that second brown horse must be four.\n4.

That is not what it says: it only tells us that three of the seven are being entered.  There could be other three-year-olds that are not fast enough (or for some other reason are not being sent).  By turning \u201cthree entries\u201d into \u201cexactly three three-year-olds\u201d I forced the second brown horse to be older than three, a step on which the rest of my solution depends and that is not logically warranted.\n\n2. I never used the key age relationship \u201cBEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie.\u201d  \n   The moment that relationship is taken into account, it pins the aunt\u2019s age at an even number (twice an integer) and forces BEAUTY and LUCKY to be three if the farm really does have three Derby entrants.  That immediately makes the aunt six and pushes every other still-unknown horse to an age that is neither 3, 6 nor higher than 6.  The only age left available for the horse that lost last year is therefore 4, and only one animal can occupy that slot.\n\n3. Omitting the previous fact made me ignore the consequence that SNOWY must be four.  \n   Once BEAUTY (3), LUCKY (3) and BILLY (3) are fixed, the ages 5 +  are taken by Beauty\u2019s mother (who was three when she herself won the Derby) and by the \u201coldest black daddy\u201d.  That leaves exactly one age, four, for the remaining unnamed horse \u2013 SNOWY \u2013 whether or not we have yet decided on his sex.  Because last year\u2019s runner must be four this year, SNOWY is automatically the loser.\n\n4. Wrong assumption about the stallion.  \n   The poem does not say there is only one stallion on the farm; it merely says that the horse that ran last year was a stallion.  Any male horse therefore qualifies.  By saying \u201cso this older brown horse is a stallion\u201d I assumed away what I was supposed to prove.\n\n5. Arbitrary identification of colour and name.  \n   Nothing in the text states what colour ROCKY is, or even that ROCKY is male.  I simply declared the unnamed brown to be ROCKY.  That was an assumption, not a deduction.\n\n6. Ignoring the possibility that SNOWY is male.  \n   The verse tells us SNOWY\u2019s colour but never specifies sex.  A white horse can perfectly well be a stallion.  By tacitly treating SNOWY as female or of indeterminate sex I excluded the correct candidate at the outset.\n\n7. Collateral clues I failed to use.  \n   \u2022 Beauty\u2019s mother \u201cwon in the Derby\u201d \u2013 she had to have been three at the time, hence is now at least five.  \n   \u2022 \u201cOf three blacks, the oldest is a daddy\u201d \u2013 that oldest black must be older than Beauty\u2019s mother, giving us yet another distinct age above five.  \n   These facts dovetail with the age-distribution argument above and again leave a single four-year-old slot that only SNOWY can occupy.\n\nBecause of those errors and omissions my conclusion (ROCKY, a brown four-year-old stallion) is impossible under a consistent reading of all the clues, whereas SNOWY, a white four-year-old stallion, uniquely fits every one of them.", "Status": true}

I never gave that chain of eliminations, so the claim \u201cmust be with G\u201d was\n     asserted without proof.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n4. \u201cThe F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3 \u2026 so T is on 1 and F on 3.\u201d\n   \u2022 Wrong implication  \n     From the letters already sitting on the boards it is true that F and T have to occupy\n     pyramids 1 and 3, but which of the two letters goes to which pyramid is not yet decided.\n     I fixed T\u21921, F\u21923 solely to avoid the LIGHT clash with H (which was on 3 in my arbitrary assignment in error #2).\n     Had I chosen the alternative placement in error #2 (H on 1, C on 3), I would have had to put T on 3 and F on 1.\n     Again: the final choice is determined only after all constraints are processed; I adopted one branch\n     without proving the opposite branch impossible.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n5. \u201cBecause of QUICK, Q cannot be on the same pyramid as I, so it is on pyramid 2.\u201d\n   \u2022 Incomplete argument  \n     QUICK merely tells us Q \u2260 I, Q \u2260 U, Q \u2260 C, Q \u2260 K.  \n     At the stage when I made the assertion, Q could have gone on pyramid 1 or 4 as well; only later, when\n     I plugged K onto pyramid 4, did pyramid 2 become mandatory.  I skipped that justification.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n6. Lack of proof of uniqueness  \n   I produced one working arrangement but did not show that it is the\n   only possible arrangement (up to renaming the five pyramids).\n   A complete solution is expected either to provide such a proof or to state explicitly that several\n   solutions exist and to list them; my answer contained neither.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n7. \u201cLucky consistency\u201d  \n   Despite the logically unsound steps above, the constellation I finally reached\n\n      1: M C T W X  \n      2: A L R V Q  \n      3: N H F B U  \n      4: G E Y J K  \n      5: O P D I S\n\n   does indeed spell every given word with one letter from each pyramid.\n   The success, however, does not validate the erroneous deductions listed;\n   it only means that my arbitrary branch choices happened to collide in a\n   consistent way.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSummary of the main errors\n\n\u2022 Error #1: P forced onto pyramid 5 \u2013 completely unfounded.  \n\u2022 Error #2: Arbitrary allocation of C/H to pyramids 1/3 \u2013 not logically compelled.  \n\u2022 Error #3\u20135: Several \u201cmust\u201d statements without full elimination proofs.  \n\u2022 Error #6: No demonstration of uniqueness.  \n\nHad any of those unexplained choices turned out differently, I might have ended\nwith an invalid arrangement; I simply got lucky.

Order-of-play / swap timing never checked.  \n    \u2022 Statement 1 happens **before** the swap, the other 15 after.  \n    \u2022 If the Switcher had swapped June with someone else, June\u2019s line 1 might retroactively become false.  \n    \u2022 You never proved that the swap you propose is the only one that keeps line 1 true.\n\n10.

No mapping of roles at all  \n   \u2022 Required: six explicit player-role pairs.  \n   \u2022 Supplied: none.  \n   \u2022 Consequence: 100 % of the solution is incorrect / missing.\n\n2.

No analysis of the Switcher action (who was swapped)  \n   \u2022 Correct solution: Emma (Switcher) swaps Ivy and Carl after the first statement; that fact is pivotal to interpreting which statements are made in a role\u2019s original body and which in the switched body.  \n   \u2022 Your answer: no mention of any swap, so every later truth evaluation would be impossible.\n\n4. No exploitation of the Spy / \u201cknows who was switched\u201d statements  \n   \u2022 Correct solution: Carl ends up as the Spy and therefore knows the swap, which makes his statements truthful (because the Spy is not required to lie).  \n   \u2022 Your answer: never looked at those lines.\n\n5. No use of Cupid and pairing restriction (\u201ccannot pair themselves\u201d)  \n   \u2022 Correct solution: June as Cupid pairs Emma with Draco; that lets June truthfully say \u201cEmma knows Draco\u2019s role.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Your answer: did not address the pairing at all and therefore could not eliminate impossible role distributions.\n\n6. No consideration of knowledge-based statements  \n   \u2022 Many lines hinge on who \u201cknows someone\u2019s role,\u201d \u201cknows the Switcher,\u201d etc.  \n   \u2022 Without tracing who can possess that knowledge after the swap you cannot distinguish Detective from people who merely got information through pairing.  \n   \u2022 Your submission makes no attempt.\n\n7. No contradiction checks against the single-liar premise  \n   \u2022 Correct solution isolates Ivy as Liar by checking each candidate\u2019s full statement list and verifying that every other speaker can be consistent when taking them as truthful.  \n   \u2022 Your submission: no contradiction search, so nothing prevents multiple liars or universal truth-telling.\n\n8. No elimination of roles by impossibility  \n   \u2022 Example from correct solution: Emma cannot be Cupid because Cupid may not pair themself; Emma cannot be Detective/Spy because she says \u201cI don\u2019t know the Spy.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Your answer missing; hence you never trimmed the role possibilities.\n\n9. No handling of statements referring to themselves  \n   \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m the Spy \u2013 Ivy\u201d is false because Ivy becomes the Liar\u2019s body after the swap.  \n   \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m not the Spy \u2013 Xavior\u201d is true, giving a strong clue that Xavior is either Normal or Detective.  \n   \u2022 You never analysed these self-referential lines.\n\n10. No explanation of final consistency check  \n   \u2022 A complete solution must show that with the final assignment every truthful speaker\u2019s statement is true and Ivy\u2019s statements are false, both before and after the swap.  \n   \u2022 Your answer: none.\n\nSummary of errors  \n\u2022 Every required element missing (role assignment, switch pair, paired lovers, truth table, justification).  \n\u2022 Therefore your solution is entirely incorrect.\n\nWhat had to be done  \nTo reach the correct answer you needed to  \n1. Assume each player as potential Liar, trace statements for contradictions.  \n2. Use statements about \u201cknowing\u201d to narrow Detective/Spy/Cupid candidates.  \n3. Apply the \u201cswitch after first statement\u201d mechanic and update roles/knowledge accordingly.  \n4. Apply Cupid restriction (cannot pair self) and \u201cEmma knows Draco\u2019s role\u201d to nail down Cupid and the pair.  \n5.

You neglected statements that also depend on one another in the same way:  \n   \u2022 B1 (\u201cD did not do it\u201d) and D1 (\u201cB\u2019s first statement is false\u201d) must have opposite truth-values,  \n   \u2022 B2 (\u201cD\u2019s third statement is false\u201d) and D3 (\u201cA did it\u201d) must have opposite truth-values.  \n   Because you did not force exactly one of each of those pairs to be true, some of your tallies of the six true /\n   six false requirement are wrong.\n\n3.

In fact, with the information supplied the puzzle admits more than one consistent assignment of six true and six false statements, so the culprit cannot be identified uniquely by the reasoning you employed.\n\nIn short, the mistake is a chain of faulty counting: you fixed the number of false statements contributed by the \u201cmeeting\u2019\u2019 and the \u201cdriving\u2019\u2019 pairs, ignored the forced opposites (B1/D1 and B2/D3), treated A3 as free, and so under\u2013counted the statements that could be made false in the A-did-it, C-did-it and D-did-it scenarios.  Once those oversights are corrected, your deduction collapses and B can no longer be singled out as the car thief.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 30, "Question": "Question: A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler.  The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.\nThe four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.\nSuspect A:\n1. C and I have met many times before today.\n2. B is guilty.\n3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.\nSuspect B:\n1. D did not do it.\n2. D's third statement is false.\n3.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas.

{"ID": 34, "Question": "Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.\n1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.\n2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.\n3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.\n4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.\n5. Bill never played Dave.\n6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.\n7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.\n8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.\n9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.\n10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.\n11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.\n12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.\n13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.\n14. In the first round, Dave didn't play the eventual champion\n Your Solution: RANKING/ PLAYER/ GAMES\n1st - Jamie McNeilly, 15 games\n2nd - Lottie Averson, 14 games\n3rd - Kristin Toskhaya, 9 games\n4th - Bill White, 7 games\n5th - Patrice Chang, 4 games\n6th - Regina Diaz, 3 games\n7th - Samuel Fitzroy, 2 games\n8th - Dave Gianelli, 1 game\n1st Round\nBeachcomber, Jamie, 5, Patrice, 4\nBrooklyn, Kristin, 5, Regina, 3\nEastlake, Bill, 5, Samuel, 2\nSouthville, Lottie, 5, Dave, 1\n2nd Round\nIslip, Jamie, 5, Bill, 2\nUncle Phil's, Lottie, 5, Kristin, 4\n3rd Round\nN. Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round.

Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang.

{"ID": 34, "Question": "Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.\n1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.\n2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.\n3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.\n4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.\n5. Bill never played Dave.\n6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.\n7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.\n8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.\n9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.\n10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.\n11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.\n12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.\n13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.\n14.

Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang.

Row/column quotas (\u22652 and \u22644 girls apiece)  \n   Once the prime positions are marked you must choose a subset of twenty of them so that every of the 8 rows and 5 columns ends up with two, three or four girls.  \n   Your answer never attempted that balancing step.\n\n3.  Girl\u2013girl adjacency requirement  \n   Each of the twenty chosen girls has to border at least one other girl (8-neighbourhood).  This severely prunes the already limited placements in point 2.  Again, this constraint was never examined.\n\n4.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:\n\"I see a person with blue eyes.\"\nWho leaves the island? And when do they leave?\n Your Solution: All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.\n Correct Solution: Reasoning step by step  \n\nNotation  \n\u2022 N = number of blue\u2013eyed islanders (unknown to the castaways, but in the real situation N = 100).  \n\u2022 \u201cNight k\u201d means the k-th night after the guru\u2019s announcement.  \n\u2022 All islanders are perfect logicians and act only when absolutely certain.  \n\u2022 The guru\u2019s public sentence \u201cI see a person with blue eyes\u201d is heard by everybody and is known by everybody to be heard by everybody, etc.; thus it becomes common knowledge.\n\n1. Why the guru\u2019s sentence matters  \nBefore the announcement every islander already sees at least one blue-eyed person (unless he himself is the only one).  \nHowever, that fact is not common knowledge: if I see a blue-eyed person I do not know whether the person I am looking at also sees a blue-eyed person.  \nThe guru\u2019s statement changes this: now everyone knows that everybody knows that there is (at least) one blue-eyed person.\n\n2. Base case: N = 1  \nSuppose there were exactly one blue-eyed islander B.  \n\u2022 B sees no blue eyes among the other 199 people.  \n\u2022 The guru declares that she sees a blue-eyed person.  \n\u2022 Hence B deduces that the only possible blue-eyed person is himself; he is now certain of his eye colour and leaves on Night 1.  \n\u2022 Nobody else ever leaves (they are not certain of their own colour).\n\n3. Induction step  \nAssume the rule is true for every island with fewer than N blue-eyed people:  \n\u201cIf there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave together on Night k.\u201d\n\nNow consider an island with N (\u22652) blue-eyed people.  \nPick any blue-eyed islander X. X sees N\u20131 blue-eyed people around him.\n\nX\u2019s reasoning:  \na. \u201cIf my eyes were not blue, there would only be N\u20131 blue-eyed islanders.\u201d  \nb. \u201cBy the inductive hypothesis those N\u20131 people would then all leave on Night (N\u20131).\u201d  \nc. \u201cIf Night (N\u20131) passes with no one leaving, my assumption in (a) must be false; therefore my eyes are blue.\u201d  \n\nEvery blue-eyed islander carries out exactly the same reasoning, so:\n\n\u2022 If nobody leaves on Night 1, everybody (in particular every blue-eyed person) knows there cannot be exactly 1 blue-eyed person.  \n\u2022 If nobody leaves on Night 2, everybody knows there cannot be exactly 2, etc.  \n\u2022 After Night (N\u20131) passes empty, each blue-eyed islander becomes certain the true number is N and that he himself is one of them.  \n\u2022 Therefore all N blue-eyed people step forward together on Night N and leave.  \n\u2022 No brown-eyed (or any other-coloured) islander ever becomes certain of his own colour, so they stay forever.\n\n4. Application to the given numbers  \nThe real island has N = 100 blue-eyed inhabitants.  \n\u2022 Nights 1, 2, \u2026, 99 pass with no one disembarking.  \n\u2022 At sunset of Night 100 every blue-eyed islander is now absolutely sure his eyes are blue, and all 100 of them announce \u201cMy eyes are blue,\u201d board the ship, and sail away.  \n\u2022 The 100 brown-eyed islanders remain, forever uncertain of whether their eyes are brown, green, purple, etc.\n\nFinal answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night; everyone else stays.", "Hint": "What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed?

Missing base case N = 1  \n\u2022 The whole induction rests on first showing what happens when there is exactly one blue-eyed islander.  \n\u2022 Your write-up starts with the case N = 2 and merely says \u201cFirst we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island.\u201d  \n\u2022 Without the explicit N = 1 analysis, the readers (and, more importantly, the islanders in the chain of reasoning) have no foundation on which to build the N = 2 inference.  \n\u2022 In the correct proof the lone blue-eyed islander hears the guru\u2019s statement, sees no blue eyes, and leaves the FIRST night; that fact becomes the pivotal assumption used by every other islander in later cases.\n\n2. \u201cCommon knowledge\u201d created by the guru\u2019s statement is not stated  \n\u2022 Each islander already sees at least one pair of blue eyes, so a simple \u201cI see blue eyes\u201d gives no new private information.  \n\u2022 What matters is that the statement is PUBLIC and therefore every islander knows that everybody else has heard it, knows that everybody else knows that everybody else has heard it, and so on ad infinitum.  \n\u2022 Your solution never mentions this.  Without invoking common knowledge the chain-of-reasoning that drives the induction does not actually get started.\n\n3. Imprecise description of the day/night on which the realisation occurs  \n\u2022 In the N = 2 discussion you say the two blue-eyed people \u201clook at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realise\u2026\u201d, then leave \u201con the second night.\u201d  \n  \u2013 What matters is that they discover the fact on the morning AFTER the first night; calling that the \u201csecond morning\u201d is not strictly wrong, but it can mislead because one might think an extra day has passed.  \n\u2022 Similar wording (\u201cleave on the fourth day\u201d, etc.) occurs later.  The correct statement is \u201cthey all leave together on night k\u201d.\n\n4. No explicit justification that only blue-eyed people ever leave  \n\u2022 A complete solution should mention that brown-eyed (and any other-eyed) islanders never gain certainty about their own eye colour, hence they stay forever.  \n\u2022 Your answer does not address what happens to the 100 brown-eyed inhabitants.\n\n5. Induction step stated but not fully proved  \n\u2022 After N = 3 you simply say \u201cIf a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three\u2026\u201d, etc.  The chain of reasoning is correct, but you omit the explicit conditional reasoning each of the four must run through ( \u201cIf my eyes aren\u2019t blue, then there are only three; those three would have left on night 3; they did not, so my eyes are blue.\u201d ).  \n\u2022 The correct solution shows that every blue-eyed islander goes through this identical argument, guaranteeing they all leave simultaneously.\n\n6. Minor wording slips  \n\u2022 \u201che/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day\u201d should be \u201con the fourth NIGHT\u201d.  \n\u2022 \u201cseeing no one else with blue eyes\u201d in the N = 2 paragraph is ambiguous, because each of the two does in fact see one other blue-eyed person.\n\nSummary of logical gaps  \n\u2013 Omitted base case N = 1.  \n\u2013 Omitted discussion of public announcement \u2192 common knowledge.  \n\u2013 Did not formally show that brown-eyed islanders never become certain.  \n\u2013 Inductive reasoning sketched but not rigorously justified for general N.  \n\u2013 Several imprecise day/night references.\n\nNone of these flaws changes the final numerical answer, but they are essential for a completely rigorous and unambiguous logical proof.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 37, "Question": "Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:\n\"I see a person with blue eyes.\"\nWho leaves the island? And when do they leave?\n Your Solution: Reasoning step by step  \n\nNotation  \n\u2022 N = number of blue\u2013eyed islanders (unknown to the castaways, but in the real situation N = 100).  \n\u2022 \u201cNight k\u201d means the k-th night after the guru\u2019s announcement.  \n\u2022 All islanders are perfect logicians and act only when absolutely certain.  \n\u2022 The guru\u2019s public sentence \u201cI see a person with blue eyes\u201d is heard by everybody and is known by everybody to be heard by everybody, etc.; thus it becomes common knowledge.\n\n1. Why the guru\u2019s sentence matters  \nBefore the announcement every islander already sees at least one blue-eyed person (unless he himself is the only one).  \nHowever, that fact is not common knowledge: if I see a blue-eyed person I do not know whether the person I am looking at also sees a blue-eyed person.  \nThe guru\u2019s statement changes this: now everyone knows that everybody knows that there is (at least) one blue-eyed person.\n\n2. Base case: N = 1  \nSuppose there were exactly one blue-eyed islander B.  \n\u2022 B sees no blue eyes among the other 199 people.  \n\u2022 The guru declares that she sees a blue-eyed person.  \n\u2022 Hence B deduces that the only possible blue-eyed person is himself; he is now certain of his eye colour and leaves on Night 1.  \n\u2022 Nobody else ever leaves (they are not certain of their own colour).\n\n3. Induction step  \nAssume the rule is true for every island with fewer than N blue-eyed people:  \n\u201cIf there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave together on Night k.\u201d\n\nNow consider an island with N (\u22652) blue-eyed people.  \nPick any blue-eyed islander X. X sees N\u20131 blue-eyed people around him.\n\nX\u2019s reasoning:  \na. \u201cIf my eyes were not blue, there would only be N\u20131 blue-eyed islanders.\u201d  \nb. \u201cBy the inductive hypothesis those N\u20131 people would then all leave on Night (N\u20131).\u201d  \nc. \u201cIf Night (N\u20131) passes with no one leaving, my assumption in (a) must be false; therefore my eyes are blue.\u201d  \n\nEvery blue-eyed islander carries out exactly the same reasoning, so:\n\n\u2022 If nobody leaves on Night 1, everybody (in particular every blue-eyed person) knows there cannot be exactly 1 blue-eyed person.  \n\u2022 If nobody leaves on Night 2, everybody knows there cannot be exactly 2, etc.  \n\u2022 After Night (N\u20131) passes empty, each blue-eyed islander becomes certain the true number is N and that he himself is one of them.  \n\u2022 Therefore all N blue-eyed people step forward together on Night N and leave.  \n\u2022 No brown-eyed (or any other-coloured) islander ever becomes certain of his own colour, so they stay forever.\n\n4. Application to the given numbers  \nThe real island has N = 100 blue-eyed inhabitants.  \n\u2022 Nights 1, 2, \u2026, 99 pass with no one disembarking.  \n\u2022 At sunset of Night 100 every blue-eyed islander is now absolutely sure his eyes are blue, and all 100 of them announce \u201cMy eyes are blue,\u201d board the ship, and sail away.  \n\u2022 The 100 brown-eyed islanders remain, forever uncertain of whether their eyes are brown, green, purple, etc.\n\nFinal answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night; everyone else stays.\n Correct Solution: All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

Why it works.\n\n    \u2022  If the first ball breaks on the k-th throw, there have been (k\u20131) throws so far and the gap that has just failed is (14\u2013k+1).  \n    \u2022  We then linearly test at most that many floors with the second ball.  \n    \u2022  Total throws in that branch = (k\u20131) + 1 + (14\u2013k) = 14.\n\n    No branch uses more than 14 throws, so the worst-case number of trials is 14, which is optimal.\n\nOrder of floors to drop from (stop as soon as the first ball breaks):\n14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.\n\nWith this schedule the highest safe floor will always be found in at most 14 drops, and no strategy can guarantee doing better with only two balls.\n Correct Solution: If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:\nFirst drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.\nIf the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.\nIf the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.\nKeep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.", "Hint": "When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear.

The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.\n8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.\n9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.\n10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.\n11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.\n12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.\nBrothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.\nSisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.\nSurnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.\nGeography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.\nHistory errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.\n Your Solution: nan\n Correct Solution: Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.\nThe twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.\nAnne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.\nThus ( geography-history );\nDavid - Gail - Waters - 16 -8;\nEdward - Anne - O'Connell - 11- 12;\nGeorge - Diane - Vole - 15 - 11;\nLuke - Wendy - McCall - 10 - 6;\nMartin - Louella - Dean - 12 - 10;\nSammy - Susan - Seal - 14 - 7;", "Hint": "Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.", "Human Solution": "Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.

{"ID": 41, "Question": "Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)\n Your Solution: It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.\n Correct Solution: Let  \nR = the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves,  \nB = 100 \u2013 R = the number of blue-hatted dwarves.  \nWe are told 1 \u2264 R \u2264 99, and every dwarf is perfectly logical.\n\nKey facts every dwarf knows (and knows that the others know, etc.)  \n1. Every night all 100 dwarves see the other 99 hats.  \n2. It is forbidden to talk about hat colours.  \n3. There is **at least one red and at least one blue hat**.  \n4. A dwarf who can deduce that his own hat is red must stay away from the very next feast and never return.\n\nWe prove by induction on R how many nights elapse before the red-hatted dwarves stop coming.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nBase case R = 1  \nThe single red dwarf sees 0 red hats.  \nBecause everybody knows there is at least one red hat, he alone can conclude, on the very first night, \u201cI must be the red one.\u201d  \nHe therefore stays home the next night.  \nSo all red hats disappear after 1 day.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nInduction step  \nAssume for some k \u2265 1:  \n\u201cIf exactly k red hats are present, then they all leave after k nights.\u201d\n\nNow suppose there are k + 1 red hats.\n\nEach red-hatted dwarf sees k red hats.  \nHe reasons: \u201cIf my own hat were blue, then there would be exactly k red hats. By the induction hypothesis those k dwarves would all leave after k nights. So if I attend the feast on the (k + 1)-st night and still see every one of those k red dwarves present, I will know my assumption was wrong and my own hat must be red.\u201d\n\nExactly that happens: during the first k nights no one leaves (each is still unsure); on the (k + 1)-st night every red dwarf still sees the k others and therefore realises he, too, is red.

The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.\nOn the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd.

I is not 1.\n Your Solution: A=7, B=1, C=9\nD=6, E=2, F=8\nG=4, H=5, I=3\nFrom Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15.

The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4.

I did not decode the second word at all\n   \u2022 \u201cRELIGIOUS\u201d actually can be produced from the symbol lists (R E L I G I O U S matches the allowed letters for < $ ^ & ? * ! # > respectively), but once those nine letters are used there are no symbols left to encode \u201cATHEISTIC.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Therefore only the first of my two proposed words could ever come from the cipher; the second one is impossible.\n\n4.

What the official answer establishes  \n\u2003\u2022 There are exactly 126 distinct seatings once a row and its mirror image are identified.  \n\u2003\u2022 The reasoning hinges on four indispensable facts  \n\u2003  \u2013 J (Russian-only) must be at one end and immediately next to H; therefore the block J-H is fixed at either extreme.  \n\u2003  \u2013 The three English-only ladies F, K, O may be permuted arbitrarily, but they must stay contiguous unless a particular placement of N occurs.  \n\u2003  \u2013 G-L-M normally form a French block, yet they can split in the special \u201cN-next-to-M-but-outside-GLM\u201d situation.  \n\u2003  \u2013 Once those structural constraints are understood, the remaining free positions of N and the internal permutations of the interchangeable blocks give 126 cases, or 21 \u201cpatterns\u2019\u2019 \u00d7 6 permutations of F, K, O.\n\n3. Concrete errors/omissions in my answer  \n\u2003\u2022 No acknowledgement of the language-sharing constraint at all.  \n\u2003\u2022 No recognition that J must sit next to H and consequently occupy an end seat.  \n\u2003\u2022 No observation that L (French-only) needs both neighbours to speak French unless she sits at an end, which forces her to be between G and M in the majority of arrangements.  \n\u2003\u2022 No notice that F, K, O are functionally identical and hence can be permuted freely once their collective position is known.  \n\u2003\u2022 No counting procedure: I supplied neither an enumeration scheme nor an argument that eliminates reflections.  \n\u2003\u2022 Therefore I missed every single special sub-case dealt with in the correct solution (e.g. the five possible positions for N, the circumstances under which GLM can be rearranged, the restriction that G and N cannot flank L, etc.).\n\n4. Specific logical/technical mistakes  \n\u2003a) Failure to isolate forced blocks  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Block J-H is inevitable: I never mentioned it.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 In many seatings \u201cGLM\u201d is a mandatory French block; again, my answer ignored this.  \n\u2003b) Failure to consider end-seat versus interior-seat conditions  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 J must be at an end; L and M must not be at an end unless their single neighbour speaks French, etc. None of this appeared in my response.  \n\u2003c) Failure to discount mirror images  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The problem explicitly states ABCD and DCBA are identical. I never addressed that symmetry, so even if I had produced a raw count it would almost certainly have been off by a factor of 2.  \n\u2003d) Failure to handle interchangeable persons  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Because F, K, O are identical with respect to the language constraint, any counting that treats them as distinct before the very last step over-counts by 3! = 6. I did not even reach that stage.\n\n5. Missed corner cases  \n\u2003\u2022 The \u201cbreak-up\u2019\u2019 situations where N is next to M but outside GLM, making it possible for G-M-L to appear in the order G-M-L or G-L-M.  \n\u2003\u2022 The possibility that L can be at an end only when its lone neighbour is G or M.  \n\u2003\u2022 Positions where FKO straddle a sub-group such as G-N-L.  \n\u2003\u2022 The necessity of disallowing a configuration in which L sits next to N (no common language).\n\n6.

{"ID": 47, "Question": "Question: The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters.

No interpretation of the clues  \n   \u2022 The puzzle gives four precise relational clues (fairness, scarredness, handsomeness and who stands next to whom).  \n   \u2022 Your answer contains no attempt to translate those verbal clues into logical constraints or to place the four men in a line.  \n   \u2022 Without turning the clues into statements such as \u201cThe two men adjacent to Mad Ade are not fair\u201d or \u201cBuster is next to exactly one handsome man,\u201d it is impossible to deduce anything.\n\n2. No placement of the four men  \n   \u2022 A typical solution starts by listing the four unknown positions ( _1_  _2_  _3_  _4_ ), deciding where Mad Ade could stand, then applying each clue to narrow positions down.  \n   \u2022 Your answer shows no trace of that positional reasoning.\n\n3. No attribute tables or elimination work  \n   \u2022 Successful solvers normally create a grid or table marking each man\u2019s possible traits (Fair? Handsome? Scarred?) and then eliminate contradictions.  \n   \u2022 Your answer does not mark any possibilities, so nothing is ever eliminated.\n\n4. No case-splitting or contradiction checks  \n   \u2022 The correct solution has to split into Case 1 / Case 2, then discard Case 1 once it violates clue 3.  \n   \u2022 Your answer contains no such branching, so you never arrive at the sole consistent arrangement.\n\n5. Missing the requested final statement  \n   \u2022 The puzzle explicitly asks \u201cWho is fair, handsome and unscarred?\u201d  \n   \u2022 Your answer does not identify any person, so it is automatically judged incorrect.\n\nHow to fix the solution\n\nA minimal correct approach would have included the following stages:\n\nA. Represent the line as four slots.  \nB. Use clue (2) to put two \u201cnot-fair\u201d people on either side of Mad Ade, leaving only two positions where \u201cfair\u201d is possible.  \nC. Use clue (4) (Cliff not next to exactly one scarred man) to eliminate one of those two positions, forcing Cliff to be the unique fair-handsome-unscarred person.  \nD. Verify that the remaining clues (especially Buster\u2019s \u201cexactly one handsome neighbour\u201d) are satisfied in that configuration.\n\nBecause none of these steps were carried out, the answer is effectively blank and therefore wrong.\n\nSummary of errors\n\n\u2022 No parsing of clues  \n\u2022 No logical deductions  \n\u2022 No explicit placement of men or traits  \n\u2022 No final conclusion\n\nAny of these omissions alone would invalidate the solution; taken together they leave the problem unsolved.", "Status": true}

Throwing away heats D and E  \n   \u2022 I wrote that every horse in heats D and E is slower than D1 or E1 and\n     therefore cannot be in the overall top-3.  \n     The conclusion is correct, but strictly speaking what we know is\n\n       D2 , D3 , \u2026 < D1 < three faster horses\n       E2 , E3 , \u2026 < E1 < three faster horses.\n\n     I should have said explicitly that \u201cthree faster horses\u201d are the first three in\n     the winners\u2019 race, not merely A1, B1, C1 in the notation I happened to be\n     using after a possible relabelling.\n\n3.
