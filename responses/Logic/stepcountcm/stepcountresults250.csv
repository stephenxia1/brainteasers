0,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","Let the two switches be  

A – the “counter” switch (its position will carry the information)  
B – a “spare” switch whose only purpose is to give a prisoner something he can
legally flip when he does not want to touch A.

Initial fact to be remembered by everybody  
A = OFF ,  B = OFF.

Before they are separated the prisoners agree on two rôles.

• One prisoner will be the Leader.  
• The remaining 22 will be Ordinary prisoners.

PRIVATE MEMORY  
Each Ordinary prisoner keeps one personal bit “I-have-already-signalled”, initially
FALSE.  
The Leader keeps an integer counter, initially 0.

RULES FOR AN ORDINARY PRISONER  
When he is taken to the switch room he looks at A.

1. If A is OFF and his personal flag is still FALSE  
      – He flips A from OFF to ON (this is his one and only signal).  
      – He sets his personal flag to TRUE.

2. In every other situation (A is ON, or he has already signalled earlier)  
      – He ignores A and flips B instead (from OFF to ON or from ON to OFF,
        whichever it happens to be).  

Thus every Ordinary prisoner will flip A from OFF to ON exactly once in his
life, and never again touches A afterwards.  
At all later visits he merely toggles the spare switch B.

RULES FOR THE LEADER  
When the Leader is taken to the switch room he acts as follows.

1. If A is ON  
      – He flips A back to OFF.  
      – He adds 1 to his personal counter.

2. If A is OFF  
      – He flips B (so that he obeys the “must flip exactly one switch”
        requirement).

As soon as the Leader’s personal counter reaches 22 he knows that every one of
the 22 Ordinary prisoners has already given his unique signal, hence each of
them must have visited the room at least once.  
At that moment he announces “All of us have visited the switch room.”

WHY THE STRATEGY WORKS

• Because the initial state A = OFF is known, the only way A can ever be found
  ON is that an Ordinary prisoner who had not signalled before just flipped it
  to ON.  
  Therefore each time the Leader sees A = ON he is certainly counting a
  previously uncounted prisoner.

• No Ordinary prisoner will ever flip A from ON back to OFF, so the Leader is
  the only person who can reset A to OFF.  
  Hence every “ON” that the Leader sees corresponds to a different Ordinary
  prisoner.

• There are exactly 22 Ordinary prisoners, so after the Leader has seen A in
  the ON position 22 times his counter reaches 22 and in fact everyone has
  visited.

• The spare switch B is irrelevant to the logic; it only guarantees that every
  prisoner can always obey the warden’s rule “you must flip exactly one
  switch”, even when he does not want to change A.

• The warden’s promise that every prisoner is brought to the switch room
  infinitely often guarantees that
  – the Leader will eventually collect all 22 signals, and  
  – every Ordinary prisoner who has not yet signalled will eventually encounter
    the room in a state with A = OFF, giving him the opportunity to send his
    one signal.

Consequently the Leader’s announcement will eventually be both made and be
correct, so the prisoners are certain to obtain their freedom.

Final answer: One prisoner acts as Leader; the others each turn switch A from OFF to ON exactly once (using B as a dummy flip thereafter); the Leader turns A back to OFF and counts; when his count reaches 22 he announces that everyone has visited, which is guaranteed to be true.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10

1,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) A + B + C + D + E is a multiple of 6.
2) F + G + H + I + J is a multiple of 5.
3) A + C + E + G + I is a multiple of 9.
4) B + D + F + H + J is a multiple of 2.
5) AB is a multiple of 3.
6) CD is a multiple of 4.
7) EF is a multiple of 7.
8) GH is a multiple of 8.
9) IJ is a multiple of 10.
10) FE, HC, and JA are all prime numbers.","Notice that when combining clues 1 and 2, you have information about the sum of digits. You can do the same for clues 3 and 4. ","We are looking for a 10-digit pandigital number ABCDEFGHIJ (no leading 0) that satisfies ten arithmetic clues.  

Because IJ must be a multiple of 10 (clue 9), the last digit J has to be 0.  
Clue 10 requires JA to be prime; allowing the leading zero to be ignored this simply means A must be one of the one-digit primes 2, 3, 5, 7.  

Clues 7 and 10 together impose a very strong condition on the pair (E,F):

• EF must be a two–digit multiple of 7.  
• The reverse FE must be prime.

Among the 13 two-digit multiples of 7 (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98) only three satisfy “reverse is prime”:

 EF = 14 → FE = 41 (prime)  
 EF = 35 → FE = 53 (prime)  
 EF = 91 → FE = 19 (prime)

Hence (E,F) can be (1,4), (3,5) or (9,1).

Trying (E,F) = (1,4) or (3,5) forces contradictions with the other clues (each choice eventually leaves no possible digits for A or makes the required sums impossible).  
The third possibility works, so we set

 E = 9, F = 1  (and therefore EF = 91, FE = 19).

Now use GH ⋮ 8 (clue 8) but avoid the already–used digits {0,1,9}.  
The acceptable two-digit multiples of 8 are 24, 32, 48, 56, 64, 72, 96.  
Testing each in combination with HC prime (clue 10) and CD ⋮ 4 (clue 6) shows that only

 GH = 24  (H = 4, G = 2)  
 HC = 43 (prime) ⇒ C = 3  
 CD = 36 (divisible by 4) ⇒ D = 6

is viable.

So far we have

 A ? C D E F G H I J  
 ?  ? 3 6 9 1 2 4 ? 0

Digits used: {0,1,2,3,4,6,9}.  Left: {5,7,8}.

Because AB must be a multiple of 3 (clue 5) and A is one of {2,3,5,7} not yet used, the only workable choice is

 A = 5  ⇒ B must make AB divisible by 3.  
With A = 5 (sum of digits ≡ 2 mod 3) we need B ≡ 1 mod 3.  
From the remaining digits {7,8}, only 7 satisfies this.

Thus B = 7, giving AB = 57 (divisible by 3).

The one unused digit is I = 8, so IJ = 80 (multiple of 10, as required).

Finally check the three sum-divisibility conditions:

1. A+B+C+D+E = 5+7+3+6+9 = 30, multiple of 6 ✔  
2. F+G+H+I+J = 1+2+4+8+0 = 15, multiple of 5 ✔  
3. A+C+E+G+I = 5+3+9+2+8 = 27, multiple of 9 ✔  
and also B+D+F+H+J = 7+6+1+4+0 = 18, even ✔

All ten clues are now satisfied.

Therefore the mystery number is

1.  Begin with clue 3 (C and F).  
   • If C = F × 3, then F can only be 1, 2, 3 (because 3 × 4 = 12 > 9).  
     – (F,C) possibilities: (1,3), (2,6), (3,9).  
   • If C = J + 2 we would have to keep C≤9 and J≥0, but using C = F × 3 is the more restrictive start, so adopt it and analyse each pair.

2.  Take the pair (F,C) = (1,3).  
    (The other two pairs will later be seen to fail because they force impossible values for H or J.)

3.  From clue 6 (F & A):  
    F = 1 cannot equal B × 2 (would make B = 0.5), so use the second choice:  
    F = A − 4  ⇒  A = 5.

4.  Clue 8 (H, A, C):  
   • H = A/2 would give H = 2.5, impossible.  
   • Therefore H = C × 3  ⇒  H = 3 × 3 = 9.

5.  Clue 10 (J, H, C): possibilities  
   • J = H − 2  ⇒  J = 9 − 2 = 7.  
   • J = C × 2  ⇒  J = 3 × 2 = 6.  
   Keep both in mind for the moment.

6.  Clue 1 (A, B, G) with A = 5:  
   • A = B/3 would force B = 15 (impossible).  
   • Therefore A = G + 3  ⇒  G = 2.

7.  Clue 4 (D, G, E) with G = 2:  
   • D = G × 4  ⇒  D = 2 × 4 = 8 (works).  
   • The alternative D = E/3 is then unnecessary.

8.  Clue 7 (G, F, I):  
   • G = F + 1  ⇒  2 = 1 + 1, satisfied, so take this option.  
     (We therefore do NOT set I via this clue.)

9.  Clue 9 (I, H, D) with H = 9 and D = 8:  
   • I = H + 3 would give I = 12 (impossible).  
   • Therefore I = D/2  ⇒  I = 8/2 = 4.

10. Clue 2 (B, I, E) with I = 4:  
    • B = I − 4  ⇒  B = 0 (allowed, B is not the leading digit).  
    • Hence the other option (B = E + 4) is not used.

11. Digits used so far:  
    A 5, B 0, C 3, D 8, F 1, G 2, H 9, I 4 → remaining digits {6,7}.  
    (E and J are not fixed yet.)

12. Clue 5 (E, J, D) with D = 8:  
    • E = D/4 would give E = 2, but 2 is already G.  
    • Therefore E = J − 1.

13. Return to the two possibilities for J from step 5:  
    • If J = 6 → E = 5, but A is already 5 (duplicate).  
    • If J = 7 → E = 6, which is unused and works.

    So choose J = 7 and E = 6.

14. All ten digits are now assigned uniquely:

    A 5, B 0, C 3, D 8, E 6, F 1, G 2, H 9, I 4, J 7

15. Verification of every clue:

    1) A = G + 3 → 5 = 2 + 3 ✓  
    2) B = I − 4 → 0 = 4 − 4 ✓  
    3) C = F × 3 → 3 = 1 × 3 ✓  
    4) D = G × 4 → 8 = 2 × 4 ✓  
    5) E = J − 1 → 6 = 7 − 1 ✓  
    6) F = A − 4 → 1 = 5 − 4 ✓  
    7) G = F + 1 → 2 = 1 + 1 ✓  
    8) H = C × 3 → 9 = 3 × 3 ✓  
    9) I = D/2 → 4 = 8/2 ✓  
   10) J = H − 2 → 7 = 9 − 2 ✓  

All conditions are satisfied with every digit 0-9 used exactly once.

3,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).

   The step k must be coprime to n.  
   Indeed, the cycle length produced is n/ gcd(n,k).  To go through all n points we need gcd(n,k)=1.

2. Excluding the regular n-gon  
   k=1 gives the ordinary n-gon (and k=n–1 the same figure traced backwards).  
   These are not counted as “stars”, so we exclude k=1 and k=n–1.

3. Identifying reversals  
   Step k and step n–k trace the same figure in opposite directions, so they are counted once.  
   Thus each admissible pair {k, n–k} (with k≠n–k) contributes one distinct star.

Hence:

Number of admissible k’s  =  φ(n) – 2          (we subtract k=1 and k=n–1)  
Distinct stars             =  (φ(n) – 2)/2.

Check with the data given  
n=5 :  φ(5)=4  ⇒  (4–2)/2 =1 star ✓  
n=6 :  φ(6)=2  ⇒  (2–2)/2 =0 stars ✓  
n=7 :  φ(7)=6  ⇒  (6–2)/2 =2 stars ✓

Now compute for n = 1000.

Factor n: 1000 = 2³·5³.  
φ(1000) = 1000·(1–1/2)·(1–1/5) = 1000·½·4/5 = 400.

Therefore

Number of 1000-point stars = (φ(1000) – 2)/2  
                           = (400 – 2)/2  
                           = 398/2  
                           = 199.

4,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","We label the five positions from left to right  

          1   2   3   4   5  

and code the ranks by the numbers  

          10 = 1 , J = 2 , Q = 3 , K = 4 , A = 5 .  

Let C, D, H, S stand for the four suits.  
The eight clues are translated and then used one by one.

----------------------------------------------------------
A.  What the ace can sit next to
----------------------------------------------------------
Clue 5: the ace borders neither black suit (C or S) nor any diamond.  
Hence every card that is next to the ace must be a heart.

• If the ace were in one of the middle three places it would need two heart-
  neighbours, i.e. there would have to be at least two hearts in the pack.  
• If the ace is at an end it needs only one heart-neighbour, so there could be
  only one heart in the pack.

We do not yet know how many hearts we have, so we keep both possibilities.

----------------------------------------------------------
B.  How many of each suit we have
----------------------------------------------------------
We have five cards and at least one card of each suit, so exactly one suit is
duplicated.  Call that suit X; the others appear once.

----------------------------------------------------------
C.  Rule out X = H
----------------------------------------------------------
Suppose hearts were the duplicated suit.

• If the ace were in the middle it would have two heart neighbours; these
  would already use up the two hearts, so the ace itself could not be a heart.
  But then the queen (clue 2) cannot find exactly one heart neighbour
  without forcing two hearts to be adjacent (clue 6).  Impossible.

• If the ace were at an end, it would have one heart neighbour; the second
  heart would have to be elsewhere, but then the queen cannot arrange to have
  exactly one heart neighbour without standing next to both hearts.
  Impossible again.

Therefore X ≠ H; hearts occur exactly once.

----------------------------------------------------------
D.  Put the ace on the right end and create the single heart
----------------------------------------------------------
With only one heart in the whole hand, the ace must be at an end (otherwise it
would need two heart neighbours).  
By clue 8 the ace is not on the far left, so

          position 5 = A
          position 4 = the single H-card.

----------------------------------------------------------
E.  Place the queen
----------------------------------------------------------
The queen must be next to exactly one heart (clue 2).  
Only position 3 borders the heart at position 4 but not the ace at position 5,
so

          position 3 = Q.

----------------------------------------------------------
F.  Keep the jack away from hearts
----------------------------------------------------------
The jack is not allowed next to any heart (clue 3), so it cannot be in
positions 3, 4 or 5.  It must be at position 1 or 2, and it has to sit next to
at least one spade.

That observation already tells us that the duplicated suit must be S:
there has to be a spade next to the jack and another spade somewhere else
(because every other suit appears exactly once).  
Hence

          the suit that appears twice is SPADES.

All that remains is to make sure a concrete arrangement exists with exactly
two spades; the following one fulfils every condition:

          1 : K♠      (king of spades)
          2 : J♦      (jack of diamonds)
          3 : Q♣      (queen of clubs)
          4 : 10♥     (ten of hearts)
          5 : A♠      (ace of spades)

Check of the clues  
1.  The king (pos 1) is next to a diamond (pos 2).  
2.  The queen (pos 3) is next to exactly one heart (pos 4).  
3.  The jack (pos 2) is next to a spade (pos 1) and next to no heart.  
4.  The ten (pos 4) is next to a club (pos 3).  
5.  The ace (pos 5) borders neither black card nor diamond (it borders only
    the ten of hearts).  
6.  The only duplicate suit, spades, is not in adjacent positions (pos 1 and 5).  
7.  Removing only the pair {positions 2, 4} leaves  K – Q – A,
    the sole ascending triple; all other pair-removals fail.  
8.  The ace is not on the far left.

Thus every clue is satisfied, and the only possible suit that can occur twice
is uniquely determined.

2. (Creative)  Translate clue 5 and infer that every card bordering the ace must be a heart, because the ace may touch neither a black suit (C or S) nor a diamond.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Consider the two geometric possibilities this creates:

   • If the ace sits at an end (positions 1 or 5) it would need only one heart neighbour.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Observe that with five cards and at least one card of every suit, exactly one suit appears twice; call this suit X.  

5. (Creative)  Show X cannot be hearts:  
   • If hearts were duplicated and the ace were in the middle, the two required heart neighbours would exhaust the hearts, preventing the queen from having exactly one heart neighbour (clue 2) without violating clue 6.  
   • If hearts were duplicated and the ace were at an end, the single heart next to it plus a second heart elsewhere again prevents the queen from achieving exactly one-heart adjacency without forcing the two hearts to touch.  
   Hence X ≠ H and hearts occur exactly once.  

6. (Creative)  Because there is only one heart, the ace must be at an end; clue 8 rules out the far-left end, so put the ace in position 5 and the lone heart in position 4.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Place the queen: it must border exactly one heart (clue 2), so it must occupy position 3.  

8. (Creative)  Use the jack’s constraints: the jack cannot border any heart (clue 3), so it can only be in position 1 or 2 and must be next to at least one spade.

2. Rudimentary – Apply Clue 8 to pin down the absolute minimum: the character at level 10 (not Penny) uses the dagger.  
3. Creative – Exploit the arithmetic in Clue 3: because the bolo user’s level is twice the halfling’s, the only feasible pair in the 10-32 range is 10 ↔ 20, so the halfling is level 10 and the bolo user is level 20.

5. Creative – Merge Clue 1 with the 24-level figure from Step 4: the 24-level character specified in Clue 1 must therefore be the paladin, and Clue 1 also tells us that that 24-level paladin is an ogre.  
6. Rudimentary – Use Clue 2 to note that the paladin (already an ogre) cannot be an elf, trimming the elf possibilities.  
7. Creative – Leverage Clue 6 (elf is 10 levels above the kobold fighter and not a cross-bow user) together with the current level list: the only 10-level gap left is 10 ↔ 20, so the elf is level 20 (the bolo user from Step 3) and the level-10 kobold fighter is the dagger-wielding halfling.  
8. Creative – Apply Clue 7 (chimera fighter is 4 above Leonard, who is not the archbishop): 20 ↔ 16 is the only 4-level gap still open, so Leonard sits at level 16 (the cross-bow user) and the level-20 character fights chimeras.  
9. Rudimentary – Use Clue 5 (hobbit is not the giant fighter) plus existing data to identify Leonard’s race as hobbit and relocate the giant-fighting role elsewhere (later shown to be Raj).  
10. Rudimentary – Combine Clue 10 (giant fighter never uses a mace) with Clue 1 (fire-ball user distinct from 24-level ogre) to settle Raj, the giant fighter, as the fire-ball-throwing gremlin.

6,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"Let A , B , C be the three gods standing in front of you.

Tool we shall use  
For any ordinary yes-or-no sentence P define the question  

      P*  :  “If I asked you P , would you say ja ?’’                (1)

For the truth-teller and the liar the answer to P* is completely
determinate:

• if P is TRUE they must answer ja,  
• if P is FALSE they must answer da,

no matter which of the two words means “yes’’ in their language.  
(The truth-teller tells the truth twice, the liar lies twice; in both
cases the double action cancels the uncertainty about the word
meaning.  Random of course still answers arbitrarily.)

Hence whenever we address a question of the form (1) to a god that is
not Random, ja means “the embedded P is true’’ and da means “the
embedded P is false’’.

The strategy  
With three questions we shall

1. use one question to locate at least one non-Random god;
2. use the second question to find out whether that god is True or
   False;
3. with the third question determine which of the remaining two is
   Random – the last remaining god’s identity is then fixed.

Step-by-step

QUESTION 1 to A  
“If I asked you ‘Is B Random?’, would you say ja ?’’  (i.e. ( Is B R )* )

Call A’s answer x₁.

• If x₁ = ja then either
     – A is not Random and B really is Random, or
     – A is Random (answering at random) and therefore B is not Random.  
  In both sub-cases C is certainly not Random.

• If x₁ = da then either
     – A is not Random and B is not Random (so C is Random), or
     – A is Random (again answering at random); then B is not Random.  
  In both sub-cases B is certainly not Random.

Thus

      x₁ = ja  ⇒  C is guaranteed non-Random;
      x₁ = da  ⇒  B is guaranteed non-Random.

Let X denote that assuredly non-Random god ( X = C if x₁ = ja ,  
X = B if x₁ = da ).

QUESTION 2 to X  
“If I asked you ‘Are you True?’, would you say ja ?’’   ( ( X is True )* )

Because X is not Random the answer x₂ tells us X’s exact nature:

      x₂ = ja  ⇒  X is the truth-teller True,
      x₂ = da  ⇒  X is the liar False.

QUESTION 3 to X  
“If I asked you ‘Is A Random?’, would you say ja ?’’   ( ( A is Random )* )

Again X is reliable, so the answer x₃ decides whether A is the Random
god:

      x₃ = ja  ⇒  A is Random;
      x₃ = da  ⇒  A is not Random (therefore the one of {B,C} that is
                   not X is Random).

Finishing the bookkeeping  
Now we know

• which god is Random (from Question 3);  
• which of X and the still unknown god is True or False (from
  Question 2);  
• and since exactly one god is True and exactly one is False, the last
  remaining god’s identity is forced.

Hence after the three questions we can name without error which god is
True, which is False, and which is Random.

Example of the plan in action  
Suppose (unknown to us) A = Random, B = True, C = False.

– Q1 to A could randomly yield ja.  
  Because x₁ = ja we set X = C.  

– Q2 to C : “Are you True?”*  
  C is the liar, the embedded statement is false ⇒ answer da (x₂ = da).
  So C is False.  

– Q3 to C : “Is A Random?”*  
  Embedded statement true ⇒ answer ja (x₃ = ja).  
  Therefore A is Random, leaving B to be True.  

All possibilities are resolved in exactly the same way.

Thus the three questions above always determine the three gods’
identities.

Final answer:  
1. Ask A: “If I asked you ‘Is B Random?’, would you say ja?”  
   – If the reply is ja choose C as the next respondent, otherwise choose B.  
2. To that chosen god X ask: “If I asked you ‘Are you True?’, would you say ja?”  
   – ja means X is True, da means X is False.  
3. Ask the same X: “If I asked you ‘Is A Random?’, would you say ja?”  
   – ja means A is Random; da means A is not Random (so the god other than X and A is Random).  
   With Random now located and X already identified as True or False, the remaining god’s role is fixed.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

8,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).

9,"There is a ten digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) If A > B, then C = 5 or 7, else C = 0 or 1.
2) If B > C, then D = 1 or 2, else D = 4 or 9.
3) If C > D, then E = 6 or 9, else E = 3 or 5.
4) If D > E, then F = 2 or 4, else F = 1 or 6.
5) If E > F, then G = 5 or 6, else G = 0 or 7.
6) If F > G, then H = 1 or 4, else H = 8 or 9.
7) If G > H, then I = 0 or 8, else I = 6 or 7.
8) If H > I, then J = 3 or 8, else J = 2 or 5.
9) If I > J, then A = 3 or 7, else A = 4 or 8.
10) If J > A, then B = 0 or 9, else B = 2 or 3.","For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).","We work systematically through the ten conditions, remembering that every digit 0-9 must be used exactly once.

1.  From (9) we know  
   – If I > J then A is 3 or 7,  
   – else (I < J) A is 4 or 8.  

   To discover a solution we eventually find that I < J, so A must be 4 or 8.

2.  Trying A = 4 leads to contradictions in every branch, so A = 8.

3.  With A = 8, (10) says  
   – because J<A (there is no allowable J greater than 8) we must have B = 2 or 3.  
   The two possible (J, B) pairs are (2, 3) or (3, 2).

4.  Since A=8 corresponds to I < J, and the only digit allowed for I that is less than 2 or 3 is 0, we have I = 0.  
   Condition (7) therefore forces G > H and puts us in the branch
           G = 5 or 6, H = 1 or 4, F > G, E > F.

5.  Because F must exceed G and yet come from {1,2,4,6}, the only viable pairing is
           F = 6, G = 5.
   Then E must be 9 (the only digit in {6,9,3,5} that is > 6).

6.  Having E = 9 and F = 6 puts us in the “D < E” branch of (4), so D is 4 or 9.  
   It cannot be 9 (already used), hence D = 4.

7.  With D = 4 and E = 9 we need C > D (from condition 3, because E = 9 is in {6,9}).  
   Condition 1 (A > B) then yields C = 7.

8.  Now examine the two alternatives for (J, B):

   •  If (J, B) = (2, 3) we get H = 1, but (8) would require J to be 3 or 8, contradiction.  
   •  If (J, B) = (3, 2) every condition is satisfied:

        A = 8 > B = 2 ⇒ C = 7  
        B = 2 < C = 7 ⇒ D = 4  
        C = 7 > D = 4 ⇒ E = 9  
        D = 4 < E = 9 ⇒ F = 6  
        E = 9 > F = 6 ⇒ G = 5  
        F = 6 > G = 5 ⇒ H = 1  
        G = 5 > H = 1 ⇒ I = 0  
        H = 1 > I = 0 ⇒ J = 3  
        I = 0 < J = 3 ⇒ A = 8 (consistent)  
        J = 3 < A = 8 ⇒ B = 2 (consistent)

   A: squares⊕triangles → {3,4,6,9} (no 0 because A can’t lead)  
   B: evens⊕cubes        → {1,2,4,6} (0,8 rejected – both)  
   C: cubes⊕triangles    → {0,3,6,8} (1 rejected – both)  
   D: odds⊕squares       → {0,3,4,5,7} (9 rejected – both)  
   E: odds⊕cubes         → {0,3,5,7,8,9} (1 rejected)  
   F: odds⊕triangles     → {5,6,7,9} (1,3 rejected)  
   G: odds⊕primes        → {1,2,9} (3,5,7 rejected – both)  
   H: evens⊕squares      → {1,2,6,8,9} (0,4 rejected – both)  
   I: squares⊕cubes      → {4,8,9} (0,1 rejected – both)  
   J: primes⊕triangles   → {1,2,5,6,7} (3 rejected – both)

3.  Order restriction I<J eliminates I=8,9, so I=4 and J∈{5,6,7}.  
    I=4 removes 4 from any other position.

4.  For A<B we need B>3.  Trying B=1 or 2 fails, so B=6.  
    Hence A<6 and A∈{3,9} ⇒ A=3.

5.  Now C∈{0,8} (3 used, 6 used).  
    If C=8 then D must exceed 8, impossible, so C=0.

6.  With C=0, D∈{5,7}.  Analyse the two sub-cases.

   • D=5  
     – Then J≠5 (J>4), so J=7.  
     – E∈{8,9}, F∈{7,9}. 7 already used ⇒ F=9, E=8.  
     – Remaining digits {1,2}.  G∈{1,2}, H∈{1,2}, G<H ⇒ (G,H)=(1,2).  
     – Check sums: 3+6+0+5+8=22, 9+1+2+4+7=23 → 22<23 OK.

   • D=7  
     – Then J=5.  
     – F∈{5,9} but 5 used ⇒ F=9, E=8.  
     – Again (G,H)=(1,2).  
     – Sums: 3+6+0+7+8=24, 9+1+2+4+5=21 → 24<21 false.  
     Hence this branch is impossible.

7.  The only viable assignment is  

   A=3, B=6, C=0, D=5, E=8, F=9, G=1, H=2, I=4, J=7.

8.  Verify every XOR condition (all satisfied) and uniqueness (each digit 0-9 used once).

11,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"Reasoning step by step

1.  Lay the five houses out from left to right as House 1 … House 5 and keep five columns for Colour, Nationality, Drink, Cigar, Pet.

2.  From clues 8 and 9  
   • House 3 drinks milk.  
   • House 1 is the Norwegian.

3.  From clue 14 the Norwegian lives next to the blue house ⇒ House 2 is blue.

4.  Clue 4: the green house is immediately left of the white house.  
   – The pair (green, white) cannot be (1, 2) because 2 is blue.  
   – Cannot be (2, 3) because 2 is blue.  
   – Cannot be (3, 4) because 3 already fixed to milk, but clue 5 says green drinks coffee.  
   ⇒ Therefore (green, white) = (4, 5).  
   – House 4 is green and drinks coffee (clue 5).  
   – House 5 is white.

5.  Colours now known: 1=?, 2 = blue, 3=?, 4 = green, 5 = white.  
   The only unused colours are red and yellow.

6.  Clue 1: the Brit lives in the red house ⇒ House 3 is red and its owner is the Brit.  
   ⇒ The remaining unused colour, yellow, must be House 1.  

7.  Clue 7: the yellow-house owner smokes Dunhill ⇒ House 1 smokes Dunhill.

8.  Clue 11: the horse is kept next to the Dunhill smoker ⇒ the horse is in House 2.

9.  Because House 1 is yellow, 2 blue, 3 red, 4 green, 5 white — colours are fixed.

10.  We have left to assign drinks: water, tea, beer (milk and coffee already fixed).  
    Cigars left: Blends, Pall Mall, Bluemasters, Prince (Dunhill fixed).  
    Pets left: cats, birds, dogs, fish (horse already fixed).

11.  Consider where the Blends smoker can be (clues 10 & 15):  
    – If Blends were in 1 or 5 it would have only one neighbour, who would have to have both cats and water, which is impossible for 5 (coffee) and for 1 (Dunhill already fixes neighbour’s horse).  
    ⇒ Blends must be in 2, 3, or 4.

12.  Put Blends in House 2 (try).  
    • Then, by clue 15, water must be in a neighbour. House 3 drinks milk, so water must be in House 1.  
    • By clue 10 cats must be next to Blends; house 1 is already a neighbour, so let cats be in House 1 too.  
    (This satisfies both clues simultaneously.)

13.  House 1 now: Norwegian – yellow – water – Dunhill – cats. All consistent.

14.  Drinks left unassigned: tea (for the Dane) and beer.  
    Bluemasters/beer cannot be in House 2 (already Blends) ⇒ Bluemasters will be somewhere else.

15.  House 2 still needs a drink; milk & coffee taken, water in 1, so tea fits ⇒ House 2 is the Dane and drinks tea (clue 3).

16.  Bluemasters must therefore be in the only house still free for both cigar and drink pairing: House 5.  
    ⇒ House 5 smokes Bluemasters and drinks beer (clue 12).

17.  Cigars left to place in Houses 3 and 4 are Pall Mall and Prince.  
    • If House 3 smoked Prince, its owner would have to be German (clue 13) but House 3 is already the Brit, impossible.  
    ⇒ House 3 smokes Pall Mall and keeps birds (clue 6).  
    ⇒ House 4 smokes Prince and is the German (clue 13).

18.  Only one nationality left, the Swede, must be House 5.  
    Clue 2: the Swede keeps dogs ⇒ House 5’s pet is dogs.

19.  Pets now: 1 = cats, 2 = horse, 3 = birds, 5 = dogs. The only pet unassigned is fish, so the remaining house (House 4) keeps the fish.

20.  Summary of each house

   House 1: Norwegian – yellow – water – Dunhill – cats  
   House 2: Dane – blue – tea – Blends – horse  
   House 3: Brit – red – milk – Pall Mall – birds  
   House 4: German – green – coffee – Prince – fish  
   House 5: Swede – white – beer – Bluemasters – dogs

1. (Rudimentary) Set up a 5 × 5 table (houses 1–5 vs. colour, nationality, drink, cigar, pet) to record deductions.  

2. (Rudimentary) Apply clues 8 and 9 to fill in two definite facts:  
   – House 3’s drink is milk.  
   – House 1’s owner is the Norwegian.  

3. (Rudimentary) Use clue 14 (“the Norwegian lives next to the blue house”) to fix House 2 as blue.  

4. (Creative) Combine clues 4 and 5 with the current colour/drink information:  
   – Green must be immediately left of white and must drink coffee.  
   – Checking all possible adjacent pairs shows the only feasible placement is Green → House 4 (coffee) and White → House 5.  

5. (Rudimentary) Identify the two unused colours (red and yellow); then use clue 1 (“the Brit lives in the red house”) to make House 3 red with the Brit, leaving yellow for House 1.  

6. (Rudimentary) Apply clue 7: the yellow-house owner smokes Dunhill, so House 1 smokes Dunhill.  

7. (Rudimentary) Apply clue 11: the horse lives next to the Dunhill smoker, so the horse must be in House 2.  

8. (Rudimentary) List the still-unassigned items: drinks (water, tea, beer), cigars (Blends, Pall Mall, Bluemasters, Prince), pets (cats, birds, dogs, fish).  

9. (Creative) Use the neighbour constraints in clues 10 and 15 to analyse where the Blends smoker can sit.  
   – If Blends were in House 1 or 5 its single neighbour would have to satisfy two different conditions (cats and water), which is impossible.  
   – Therefore Blends must be in House 2, 3, or 4.  

10. (Creative) Try placing Blends in House 2; to satisfy clues 10 and 15 simultaneously, put water and cats in neighbouring House 1. The trial fits all current facts, so keep it.  

11. (Rudimentary) Record the fully determined profile for House 1: Norwegian – yellow – water – Dunhill – cats.  

12. (Rudimentary) Fill House 2’s remaining drink slot. With milk, coffee, and water already used, tea fits; by clue 3 this makes House 2’s owner the Dane.  

13. (Rudimentary) Locate the Bluemasters/beer pair (clue 12). House 2’s cigar is fixed to Blends, so the only house free to take both Bluemasters and beer is House 5; assign them there.  

14. (Rudimentary) Only cigars Prince and Pall Mall remain for Houses 3 and 4.  
    – Prince would force a German owner (clue 13), which conflicts with the Brit already in House 3.  
    – Therefore House 3 smokes Pall Mall and keeps birds (clue 6); House 4 smokes Prince and is the German (clue 13).  

15. (Rudimentary) The last unassigned nationality, the Swede, must occupy House 5; by clue 2 that house keeps dogs.

He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.  From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.
1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.
2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.

Find a set of five different numbers whose sum is 97 (clue 2) and whose size difference between the least populous and most populous group is 10 (clue 3).","Let  

S = number of snakes  
B = number of birds  
M = number of mammals  
I = number of insects  
P = number of spiders  

Each group contains exactly one “odd” specimen, whose heads / legs differ as stated.

Heads  
Snakes:  (S-1)·1  + 3  = S + 2  
Birds :  (B-1)·1  + 2  = B + 1  
Mammals:  M (all 1-headed)  
Insects:  I  
Spiders:  P  

Total heads = 100 ⇒ (S + 2) + (B + 1) + M + I + P = 100  
⇒ S + B + M + I + P = 97 … (H)

Legs  
Snakes: 0  
Birds : 2B  
Mammals: (M-1)·4 + 3 = 4M – 1  
Insects: (I-1)·6 + 4 = 6I – 2  
Spiders: (P-1)·8 + 7 = 8P – 1  

Total legs = 376 ⇒ 2B + 4M – 1 + 6I – 2 + 8P – 1 = 376  
⇒ 2B + 4M + 6I + 8P = 380  
⇒ B + 2M + 3I + 4P = 190 … (L)

Extra conditions  
(4) insect legs = 2 × bird legs ⇒ 6I – 2 = 4B ⇒ 3I – 2B = 1 … (C1)  
(5) snake heads = spider heads ⇒ S + 2 = P ⇒ P = S + 2 … (C2)

Use C2 in H and L:

H:  S + B + M + I + (S + 2) = 97  ⇒ 2S + B + M + I = 95 … (1)  
L:  B + 2M + 3I + 4(S + 2) = 190  
     ⇒ B + 2M + 3I + 4S = 182 … (2)

Subtract (2) – 2·(1):  
(B + 2M + 3I + 4S) – (2B + 2M + 2I + 4S) = 182 – 190  
⇒ –B + I = –8 ⇒ I = B – 8 … (3)

Combine (3) with C1: 3(B – 8) – 2B = 1 ⇒ B = 25, I = 17.

From (1): 2S + 25 + M + 17 = 95 ⇒ 2S + M = 53 ⇒ M = 53 – 2S.

P = S + 2.

Now apply “all group sizes different, and max – min = 10”.

Trial values of S (positive integers with M > 0):

S   M   P   Counts (sorted)   Range

Thus S = 19, B = 25, M = 15, I = 17, P = 21.

Verification  
Heads:  (19+2) + (25+1) + 15 + 17 + 21 = 100  
Legs : 0 + 2·25 + (4·14+3) + (6·16+4) + (8·20+7) = 376

13,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Because exactly one of the ten statements must be a lie while all the others are simultaneously true, try every passenger in turn as the lone liar and look for a seating arrangement that satisfies the other nine statements.

Doing this systematically shows that every choice but one leads to an irresolvable contradiction (usually with the “equal number of men and women in my car” requirement or with Mr. Q’s “fewer women in my car than the other”).

The only assignment that works is obtained when Mr. K is the single liar:

Dining-car passengers  
 Ms S, Mr J, Mr G, Ms P, Ms W, Mr F  
 (3 women, 3 men – satisfying Mr G’s true statement)

Passenger-car passengers  
 Mr K, Ms L, Mr Q, Mr R  
 (1 woman, 3 men – giving fewer women than the other car, as Mr Q truthfully says)

Now check each statement.

• Ms S: She and Mr J are indeed in the dining car – true.  
• Mr G: His car (the dining car) has the same number of men and women – true.  
• Mr J: Mr K is not in the dining car – true.  
• Ms L: Mr Q is in the same car she is – true.  
• Mr F: Ms W and Ms P are together (and could easily have been whispering) – true.  
• Mr R: Mr G is not in the passenger car – true.  
• Mr Q: His car has fewer women than the other – true (1 < 3).  
• Ms P: Ms L is not in the same car as she is – true.  
• Ms W: Mr F is in the opposite car from Mr R – true.  
• Mr K: “Ms P was in the passenger car” – FALSE.

All nine other statements can be true simultaneously only if Mr. K’s statement is the lone lie, so Mr. K must be the murderer.

14,"Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let the seven different one–digit numbers be  

a₁ a₂ a₃ a₄ a₅ a₆ a₇   (a₄ is the middle sportsman).

Given  
a₁a₂a₃ = a₃a₄a₅ = a₅a₆a₇.               (1)

Divide the first equality in (1) by a₃ and the second by a₅:

a₁a₂ = a₄a₅ ,                                      (2)  
a₃a₄ = a₆a₇ .                                      (3)

So we need two different pairs of distinct one–digit numbers whose
products are equal (once for (2) and once for (3)).

Among the numbers 1–9 the only products that can be obtained in TWO
different ways with distinct digits are

6 = 1×6 = 2×3  
8 = 1×8 = 2×4  
12 = 3×4 = 2×6  
18 = 2×9 = 3×6  
24 = 3×8 = 4×6 .

Hence the common value p = a₁a₂ = a₄a₅ in (2) must be one of  
6, 8, 12, 18 or 24.

We now examine each possibility, always remembering that all seven
digits must be different and must allow (3) to be satisfied as well.

• p = 6 (pairs {1,6} and {2,3})  
  Every attempt to place these four digits in the required positions
  leads to a repetition when (3) is satisfied, so p = 6 is impossible.

• p = 12 (pairs {3,4} and {2,6})  
  The same difficulty arises; no arrangement satisfies (3).  
  So p = 12 is impossible.

• p = 24 (pairs {3,8} and {4,6})  
  Again (3) cannot be satisfied without repeating a digit.  
  Thus p = 24 is impossible.

• p = 8 (pairs {1,8} and {2,4})  
  Put {1,8} in the first two places and {2,4} in places 4 and 5 with
  a₄ = 2, a₅ = 4.  Choosing a₃ = 9 gives p = a₁a₂a₃ = 1·8·9 = 72.  
  Condition (3) can then be met with the pair {3,6}; one valid line is

  1  8  9  2  4  3  6

  (Products of positions 1-3, 3-5, 5-7 are all 72).  
  Any other placing of the pairs {1,8}, {2,4} forces a digit to be
  repeated, so p = 8 is possible only with a₄ = 2.

• p = 18 (pairs {2,9} and {3,6})  
  Put {3,6} in the first two places and {2,9} in places 4 and 5 with
  a₄ = 2, a₅ = 9.  Taking a₃ = 4 gives p = 3·6·4 = 72 and (3) is
  satisfied with the pair {1,8}; one valid line is

  3  6  4  2  9  1  8

  Trying the other ways of arranging {2,9} and {3,6} again forces a
  repetition, so whenever p = 18 we still get a₄ = 2.

Conclusion  
The only value that the middle sportsman’s number can take in any
legal arrangement is 2.

15,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Strategy agreed upon during the night  

Meaning of the two possible words  
    “white”  =  “The number of white hats I can see in front of me is EVEN.”  
    “black”  =  “The number of white hats I can see in front of me is ODD.”  

(The words themselves are the only allowed signals, but we have decided that they stand for these two possible parities.)

Morning execution  

Let us number the people from the front of the line to the back  
   1, 2, … , 9, 10                  (10 is the last person, the only one who sees all the others).

Step 1 – person 10  
• He counts how many white hats he sees on heads 1–9.  
• If that number is even he says “white”; if it is odd he says “black”.  
• He survives with probability ½, because he still knows nothing about his own hat.  
• Every other person now knows the parity (even/odd) of the white hats on heads 1–9.

Step 2 – person 9  
• He sees the hats of 1–8.  
• He compares the parity he sees with the parity announced by 10.  
     – If the two parities are the same, his own hat must be black (adding it would keep the parity).  
     – If the two parities are different, his own hat must be white (adding it would flip the parity).  
• He therefore guesses correctly with certainty and survives.  
• Now everybody knows the exact colour of hat 9, so they can update the “announced parity” by
  removing hat 9 from the count.*

Step 3 – person 8  
• He sees hats 1–7, and knows (from the updated count) what the parity of the remaining unknown hats must be.  
• By the same comparison as above he deduces his own colour with certainty, speaks it, and survives.  
• The running parity is updated again.*

…

Continuing in the same way, persons 7, 6, …, 1 each determine their hat colours with certainty and survive.

(*Updating the running parity is easy: if the colour just revealed was white, flip the parity; if it was black, leave the parity unchanged.)

Outcome  

• Persons 1–9 survive for sure.  
• Person 10 survives with probability ½.  

Hence the expected number of survivors is 9 ½, and at least 9 people are guaranteed to live.

Why this is optimal  

The last person in line has no information at all about his own hat: whatever colours he sees in front of him, his own hat is equally likely to be white or black. Therefore no strategy can give him a success probability better than ½, and consequently no strategy can guarantee more than 9 survivors or an expected total exceeding 9 ½.  
The scheme above attains these limits, so it is optimal.

Final answer:  Nine people are guaranteed to live and, on average, 9 ½ survive; the strategy is that the last person uses the word “white” to announce an even number of white hats in front of him and “black” to announce an odd number, after which each subsequent person can deduce his own hat colour with certainty from that parity information.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

16,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","Reasoning

1.  Let the five birth-times (measured in minutes past some reference) be multiples of ten,

2.  From Victor’s remark the ten pair-wise gaps between the five times cover every multiple of
   10 minutes from 10 to 110 except one.  
   Therefore the ten differences are ten distinct numbers chosen from

   all of {1,2,…,11} except one integer.

   A well-known 5-point Golomb ruler of length 11 has exactly that property:  
      {0,1,4,9,11}.  
   Its differences are  
      1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11   (every integer 1–11 except 6).  
   Hence, up to an overall shift of time, the only possible birth times are  

        0, 10, 40, 90, 110 minutes.                                    (‡)

   Taking the first of these as 6:00 A.M. gives the real clock times  

        6:00, 6:10, 6:40, 7:30, 7:50.

4.  The 50-minute gap is between the third and fourth of those times
   (6:40 and 7:30).  Victor says Brand and Elana are precisely 50 minutes apart,  
   so those two names must occupy the 3rd and 4th positions in some order.

   If Elana were 3rd and Brand 4th, Brand would stand 4th –– exactly where the
   “alphabetised–by-last-letter’’ guess put him –– contradicting the statement that
   every one of the nurses’ guesses had all five names wrong.  
   Therefore

        3rd = Brand, 4th = Elana.

5.  Let us place the remaining three names (Adele, Caleb, Derec) into the
   1st, 2nd and 5th positions, keeping the requirement that

        • no name stands where the “Adele, Brand, Caleb, Derec, Elana’’ guess
          put it,
        • no name stands where the “Elana, Caleb, Derec, Brand, Adele’’ guess
          put it,
        • no name stands where the reverse of that guess put it.

   The only arrangement that satisfies all three derangement conditions is  

        1st  – Derec  
        2nd  – Adele  
        3rd  – Brand  
        4th  – Elana  
        5th  – Caleb.

   (Either attempted swap of Caleb with Derec or Adele violates at least one
   of the nurses’ wrong “alphabetical’’ orders.)

6.  Finally, Nora is the youngest of the five Shekrie siblings, so Caleb (who is
   5th in the quintuplets) shares her “birth position’’ and is the child
   she is asked to sponsor –– exactly as Victor requested.

Birth order and times

17,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  There are seven horses on the farm.  
2.  Their colours are given explicitly except for one horse:  
      • 3 blacks  
      • 2 browns (one of them the 3-year-old male BILLY)  
      • 1 white (SNOWY)  
      • 1 colour not mentioned.  
3.  Of the three blacks the oldest is a stallion (“a daddy”).  
4.  That stallion is therefore  
      – male (a stallion),  
      – black,  
      – the oldest of the black horses and one of the older horses in the stable,  
      – the sire (father) of at least one of the youngsters.  
5.  In the line “but faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY” the two slowest horses are named ROCKY and SUNNY.  
      Older, heavier horses are invariably slower than the spry youngsters, so the stallion must be one of these two.  
6.  “Their stallion’s loss last year was a pity” tells us it is that very stallion who lost last year’s Derby.  
7.  Of the two names, ROCKY is the more usual name for a male horse, while SUNNY is more commonly given to a filly or mare; picking the only plausible male name makes the stallion ROCKY.  
8.  Collecting all the information we have:  

      • Name : ROCKY  
      • Sex   : stallion (male)  
      • Colour: black  
      • Age   : the oldest of the blacks, old enough to have run in – and lost – last year’s Derby, hence at least 4 years old now.  
      • Role  : sire (“daddy”) of some of the younger horses on the farm.  

Therefore the description asked for in the challenge is:

18,"There is a 10-digit number, represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A + D is a square   → possible squares ≤18 are 1,4,9,16
2.  G + J is triangular → possible values ≤17 are 1,3,6,10,15
3.  B + I is even
4.  E·F is odd           → E and F are odd digits
5.  C·H is prime         → one factor must be 1, the other a prime digit (2,3,5,7)
6.  A / G = G / C        → AC = G²           (cross-multiplying)
7.  E + I = B + H
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Use condition (6):  AC = G² with single digits, all distinct.

   G   G²   possible distinct (A,C)
   0    0   (0,x)     (division by 0 in (6) – impossible)
   1    1   (1,1)     (digits not distinct)
   2    4   (1,4) or (4,1)
   3    9   (1,9) or (9,1)
   4   16   (2,8) or (8,2)
   5   25   impossible (5,5 same)
   6   36   (4,9) or (9,4)
   7   49   impossible
   8   64   impossible
   9   81   impossible

So only five candidates remain:

   (A,C,G) ∈ {(4,1,2), (1,4,2), (9,1,3), (1,9,3), (8,2,4), (2,8,4), (9,4,6), (4,9,6)}

Step 2.  Impose condition (5):  C·H must be prime ⇒ C=1 or H=1.
Examine each triple:

   • (4,1,2)  OK (C=1)
   • (1,4,2)  reject (C=4 → 4·H not prime)
   • (9,1,3)  OK
   • (1,9,3)  reject (C=9)
   • (8,2,4)  reject (C=2 → 2·H prime only if H=1, but 1 already needed for C)
   • (2,8,4)  reject (C=8)
   • (9,4,6)  reject (C=4)
   • (4,9,6)  reject (C=9)

Remaining possibilities:

   (A,C,G) = (4,1,2)  or  (9,1,3)

Step 3.  Work with (A,C,G) = (4,1,2).

   • From (5) C=1 ⇒ H ∈ {2,3,5,7}.  2 already used, so H ∈ {3,5,7}.
   • From (2) 2 + J is triangular → J ∈ {1,4,8}. 1 & 4 used, so J = 8.
   • From (1) 4 + D is square → possibilities: 4 (D=0) or 9 (D=5). Test both.

   (i) D=0
       Digits left: 3,5,6,7,9
       E&F must both be odd → need 2 odd digits
       B+I even → B,I both odd or both even
       Only one even digit (6) left, impossible.  Reject.

   (ii) D=5
        Digits used so far: 4,1,2,8,5   (left: 0,3,6,7,9)
        E,F odd → choose two from {3,7,9}
        H ∈ {3,7}  (prime and unused)
        To make B+I even, use the two remaining even digits 0 and 6 → {B,I}={0,6}
        Now test both orders:

        • B=0, I=6  ⇒  E + 6 = H.  Only choice E=3, H=9 but 9 not prime. Reject.
        • B=6, I=0  ⇒  E = 6 + H.  With H=3 gives E=9 (OK); H=7 impossible (E>9).

        Choose H=3, E=9, leaving F=7.

        Digits now:  A4 B6 C1 D5 E9 F7 G2 H3 I0 J8
        Verify all conditions:
           1) 4+5=9 square
           2) 2+8=10 triangular
           3) 6+0=6 even
           4) 9·7=63 odd
           5) 1·3=3 prime
           6) 4/2 = 2/1
           7) 9+0 = 6+3 = 9
        All satisfied.

Hence ABCDEFGHIJ = 4615972308.

Step 4.  Check the other surviving triple (9,1,3).
   A similar test shows it fails because there are not enough odd digits for E,F,H.
   Thus no other arrangement works.

Therefore the solution is unique.

•  The faces 1, 2, 4 and 6 all have all their pips arranged symmetrically, so there is no single pip in the centre of the face.  
•  The faces 3 and 5 each have one central pip; think of that pip as the “rose”.  
    – On the face 3 there are two other pips round that centre one – two “petals”.  
    – On the face 5 there are four other pips round the centre – four “petals”.

The computer counts only these “petals around the rose” and ignores every other pip.

22,"A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler.  The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.
Suspect A:
1. C and I have met many times before today.
2. B is guilty.
3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Suspect B:
1. D did not do it.
2. D's third statement is false.
3. I am innocent.

1. I have never met A before today.
2. B is not guilty.
3. D knows how to drive.
Suspect D:
1. B's first statement is false.
2. I do not know how to drive.
3. A did it.
Which one is the car thief?","Consider that six statements are false. A's first statement and C's first statement contradict each other.  One of them is false.  C's and D's  contradict each other.  One of them is false.  Therefore, there are four additional false statements.","Let  

G  = the guilty person (A, B, C or D)  
M  = “A and C have met before today’’  
KD = “D knows how to drive’’  
U  = “the car thief did not know it was the Inspector’s car’’  (given true by the
story line).

Statements (rewritten):

A1  M  
A2  G = B  
A3  U                                  (always true)  

B1  G ≠ D  
B2  G ≠ A  
B3  G ≠ B  

C1  ¬M  
C2  G ≠ B  
C3  KD  

D1  “B1 is false’’  →  B1 is false  
D2  ¬KD  
D3  G = A  

Exactly six of the twelve statements are true.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Assume G = A  

True so far: A3, B1, B3, C2, D3  (5)  
False so far: A2, B2, D1          (3)

The four undecided statements (A1,C1,C3,D2) are two complementary
pairs (A1/​C1 and C3/​D2); each pair contributes one true and one false.
That would give at least 2 further truths, producing ≥7 true statements.
Impossible.  
So A cannot be guilty.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Assume G = C  

True so far: A3, B1, B2, B3, C2   (5)  
False so far: A2, D1, D3           (3)

Again we have the two complementary pairs left.
They would raise the number of true statements to 7.
Impossible.  
So C cannot be guilty.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Assume G = D  

True so far: A3, B2, B3, C2, D1   (5)  
False so far: A2, B1, D3           (3)

The same argument as above gives at least 2 more truths → ≥7 truths.
Impossible.  
So D cannot be guilty.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Assume G = B  

True so far: A2, A3, B1, B2        (4)  
False so far: B3, C2, D1, D3       (4)

The remaining four statements are the two complementary pairs.
Whichever truth-values M and KD take, each pair supplies exactly one
true and one false, giving

total true statements = 4 + 2 = 6  
total false statements = 4 + 2 = 6.

This meets the required 6/6 split, so the assumption is consistent.

Since B is the only suspect for which the conditions can be satisfied,
B must be the car thief.

4) Girls are located at positions that are prime numbers.
5) Boys are located at positions that are either squares or cubes.
6) Jacob is the only boy that borders a unique number of girls.",The number 1 is not a prime number.,"Step 1 – translate the arithmetic clues into forced genders  
• Prime-numbered positions → must be Girls (G).  
  Primes ≤ 40 : 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37  → 12 forced G’s.  
• Square or cube positions → must be Boys (B).  
  Squares / cubes ≤ 40 : 1,4,8,9,16,25,27,36 → 8 forced B’s.  

Step 2 – place the 12 forced girls and 8 forced boys in the 8 × 5 grid  

Row 1 : 1 B  2 G  3 G  4 B  5 G  6 ?  7 G  8 B

Row 5 :33 ? 34 ? 35 ? 36 B 37 G 38 ? 39 ? 40 ?  

Step 3 – satisfy the row / column quota (each row & column must contain 2–4 girls)  
A systematic count yields the extra girls that must be added:

• Column 1 has only 17 G → make 33 a girl.  
• Column 2 has only 2 G’s needed; 26 chosen as girl (useful later).  
• Column 4 has no girls → choose 12 and 28 as girls.  
• Column 6 has no girls → choose 14 and 38 as girls.  
• Column 8 needs 2 girls → choose 24 and 40 as girls.  

After also adding 14 to give a neighbour to girl 7, every row / column now has exactly 4 girls:

Row 1 : 2,3,5,7  
Row 2 : 11,12,13,14  
Row 3 : 17,19,23,24  
Row 4 : 26,28,29,31  
Row 5 : 33,37,38,40  

Total girls = 20, total boys = 20.

Step 4 – check the “every girl borders another girl” rule  
With the above placement the two potentially isolated girls (7 and 17) are now adjacent to 14 and 26 respectively; 33 touches 26; every girl borders at least one girl.

Step 5 – count, for each boy, how many neighbouring girls he has  
(Adjacency is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal – up to 8 squares.)

Boy  1 : 1 girl  
Boy  4 : 5 girls  
Boy  6 : 4 girls  
Boy  8 : 1 girl  
Boy  9 : 2 girls  
Boy 10 : 5 girls  
Boy 15 : 4 girls  
Boy 16 : 3 girls  
Boy 18 : 4 girls  
Boy 20 : 6 girls        ← unique  
Boy 21 : 5 girls  
Boy 22 : 5 girls  
Boy 25 : 3 girls  
Boy 27 : 3 girls  
Boy 30 : 5 girls  
Boy 32 : 4 girls  
Boy 34 : 2 girls  
Boy 35 : 2 girls  
Boy 36 : 3 girls  
Boy 39 : 3 girls  

The only boy whose number of bordering girls is unique is the boy in position 20, who borders 6 girls.

25,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"Reasoning in full

Common set-up  
• 200 perfect logicians.  
• 100 have blue eyes, 100 have brown.  
• Each person sees everyone else’s eyes but not his own.  
• They cannot communicate, so the only publicly shared information is whatever is said aloud in front of everyone.  
• Each midnight a ship comes; anyone who can state his own eye-colour with absolute certainty may board.  
• If wrong, he is shot, so nobody will risk a guess.  
• The guru (always truthful) stands before them all and says:  
  “I see a person with blue eyes.”

What the guru’s sentence does  
Before the announcement each islander already sees at least some eye-colours, but there is no common knowledge that blue eyes exist. The guru’s sentence creates that common knowledge:

(1) Everybody now knows that at least one blue-eyed person exists.  
(2) Everybody knows that everybody knows that at least one blue-eyed person exists.  
(3) …and so on ad infinitum.

That infinite tower of mutual knowledge is exactly what the logicians need to start a chain of deductions that ends with certainty about their own eyes.

The inductive argument  

Base case: N = 1 blue-eyed person  
Suppose there were only one blue-eyed islander, call him B.  
• B looks around and sees no blue eyes at all.  
• Because the guru said “I see a person with blue eyes,” B realizes the guru must be referring to him.  
• Therefore B is absolutely certain his own eyes are blue and leaves on the first night.  
• Everyone else (all brown-eyed) stays, as they already knew they were not the single blue-eyed person the guru saw.

Inductive step: assume the theorem true for N − 1  
Induction hypothesis: If exactly N − 1 islanders have blue eyes, they will all leave simultaneously on night N − 1.

Now consider the real world with N blue-eyed people, where N ≥ 2.  
Pick one of them and call her Alice. Alice sees N − 1 blue-eyed people. She must decide whether she herself is blue or brown. These are her options:

• If Alice is brown, then only N − 1 blue-eyed people actually exist.  
  – By the induction hypothesis they would all depart on night N − 1.  
  – Therefore, if midnight of night N − 1 passes and nobody leaves, Alice’s “brown” assumption is impossible.

• When midnight of night N − 1 does pass without any departures, Alice becomes certain she is blue. All N blue-eyed people make the same deduction simultaneously, because each of them ran the same reasoning with themselves in the role of Alice and observed the same outcome (no one left). Hence they all leave together on night N.

Conclusion for the actual numbers  
Here N = 100. Therefore:

Night 1 … 99:   Nobody leaves  
Night 100:       All 100 blue-eyed islanders depart simultaneously  
Afterwards:      The 100 brown-eyed islanders remain forever (or until further information appears).

Hence the final outcome is completely determined.

26,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","Reasoning step–by–step

1.  Let N be the largest number of drops you are willing to need in the worst case.  
    Suppose you make the first drop from floor x.  

      – If the ball breaks, you have at most x–1 further floors to test one-by-one with the
        second ball, i.e. (x–1) more drops.  
      – If it does not break, you have already used 1 drop and you still dispose of both balls;  
        hence at most N–1 drops remain for the rest of the building above floor x.

    Therefore we want
           max{ x, 1+(N–1) }  ≤  N   →   x  =  N.

    At the next step we repeat the same reasoning with N–1 remaining drops, so the
    interval we can safely skip above floor x is N–1 floors, etc.  
    Consequently the distances between successive “first-ball” drops must be

           N,  N–1,  N–2, … , 3, 2, 1.

2.  We need those distances to add up to at least the 100 floors of the building:

           N + (N–1) + … + 1  =  N(N+1)/2  ≥  100.

    Solve the quadratic inequality:

           N(N+1) ≥ 200  →  N² + N – 200 ≥ 0
           ⇒  N ≥ 14   (because 14·15/2 = 105 ≥ 100, whereas 13·14/2 = 91 < 100).

    Hence the minimal worst-case number of drops is 14.

3.  Take the distances 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 1  
    (sums to exactly 100; the final gaps 3 and 2 are unnecessary because 105 – 100 = 5
    spare floors).

4.  Starting from ground level, add those gaps cumulatively to obtain the floors for the
    first (trial) ball:

        Drop 1 :  14
        Drop 2 :  14 +13 = 27
        Drop 3 :  27 +12 = 39
        Drop 4 :  39 +11 = 50
        Drop 5 :  50 +10 = 60
        Drop 6 :  60 + 9 = 69
        Drop 7 :  69 + 8 = 77
        Drop 8 :  77 + 7 = 84
        Drop 9 :  84 + 6 = 90
        Drop10 :  90 + 5 = 95
        Drop11 :  95 + 4 = 99
        Drop12 :  99 + 1 = 100

5.  How it works:

    • If the first ball breaks on the k-th drop, you have already made k drops;
      at that point the previous safe floor is the (k–1)-st entry in the list.
      The gap just skipped contains at most 14–(k–1) ≤ 13 floors, which you now
      check sequentially with the second ball.  
      Therefore total drops ≤ k + (14–k) = 14.

    • If the first ball never breaks (even at floor 100) the task finishes in
      12 drops, still within the 14-drop bound.

Thus 14 drops are sufficient and necessary, and an optimal testing order is:

14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

Final answer: Drop the first ball successively from floors  
14 → 27 → 39 → 50 → 60 → 69 → 77 → 84 → 90 → 95 → 99 → 100,  
switching to linear one-floor-at-a-time testing with the second ball as soon as the first ball breaks; this guarantees finding the critical floor in at most 14 drops, which is the minimal possible worst-case number.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

ALI BOBO tells you that he owns the 3rd (""Aluminum""), 6th(""Boron""), and 9th(""Copper"") fastest camels. He concedes that KAREEM owns the 1st, 4th, and 7th fastest camels, while SHARIF has the 2nd, 5th, and 8th fastest entries. There are other owners but with far inferior camels.
The Rules
a. Maximum 3 camels per owner.
b. A camel can run only in one race.
c. An owner may enter his camels all in one race or distribute them as he desires.
Last year ALI BOBO's camels won third place in each of the 3 Races. His gross winnings amounted to $225.
ALI BOBO wants a risk-free strategy to increase his total winnings.
QUESTION: What should be ALI BOBO's strategy?",Sometimes we must sacrifice some battles to win the war.,"Let  

  Aluminum  (A₁) = 3-rd fastest camel,  
  Boron     (A₂) = 6-th fastest,  
  Copper    (A₃) = 9-th fastest.  

The six animals that can outrun Boron and Copper are owned by Kareem and Sharif:

  Kareem : K₁(1st)  K₂(4th)  K₃(7th)  
  Sharif : S₁(2nd)  S₂(5th)  S₃(8th)

All other camels are slower than Copper and can be ignored.

1.  What is the best cash prize Ali can be certain of getting from Aluminum?  
 Placing Aluminum in the richest race (A) only guarantees third place ($100); Kareem and Sharif can both put their No. 1 animals there.  
 Placing Aluminum in race B does not even guarantee a prize – four faster camels could be entered against him.  
 Placing Aluminum in race C, however, gives him first place ($150): neither of the other owners will ever waste one of their two first-rate animals on the cheapest race when the same camel would earn $500 or $300 in race A or $250 or $150 in race B.  
 Therefore Aluminum should run in race C and is sure of $150.

2.  What is the best cash prize Ali can be certain of getting from Boron?  
 Exactly the same reasoning applies.  
 If Boron also runs in race C, the only faster animals still available to oppose him are K₃(7th) and S₃(8th).  
 Those two can do no better than third place in race B ($75) but can earn at most third place in race C ($50); hence at least one of them will stay in race B.  
 Consequently Boron is guaranteed second place in race C and $100.

3.  Copper cannot be guaranteed a prize anywhere; he is slower than eight other camels.  Ali can put him in any race he likes (or even leave him out) without affecting the sure money already found.

Guaranteed total for Ali with the above placement

 Race C ‑ 1st (Aluminum) ………… $150  
 Race C ‑ 2nd (Boron) …………… $100  
 Copper – no guaranteed money …   $  0  
               —————  
 Guaranteed minimum ……………… $250

$250 is $25 more than last year’s $225, and no matter how Kareem and Sharif arrange their entries they cannot prevent Ali from taking first and second in the inexpensive race C.

28,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"Let R be the number of red-hatted dwarves present that first night (1 ≤ R ≤ 99 because there is at least one blue hat).  

Induction argument (the same one used in the classical “blue-eyed islander” puzzle).

1. Base case R = 1  
   Each dwarf sees everyone else’s hat.  
   The lone red-hat sees no red hats, yet everyone was told there is at least one red hat.  
   Therefore he realises he himself must be red and stays home the very next night.  
   So with one red hat it takes 1 day.

2. Inductive step  
   Assume that whenever the forest contains k − 1 red hats, they all stay away after k − 1 nights.  
   Now suppose there are k red hats.  
   Every red-hat sees k − 1 red hats.  
   Each of them reasons: “If I am blue, then only k − 1 red hats exist, so they will all leave after k − 1 nights.”  
   When night k − 1 passes and nobody has left, every red-hat realises the assumption “I am blue” was wrong; hence he is red.  
   Therefore all k red-hatted dwarves stay home the following night, i.e. on night k.  

By induction, with R red hats they all stop attending after exactly R nights.

Consequently, the feast is red-hat–free after R days, where R is the initial number of red-hatted dwarves (at most 99).

so that all five clues hold.

1) Row–sum order  
   A+B+C  >  D+E+F  >  G+H+I.

2) E is a prime factor of G.  
   The only primes ≤9 are 2,3,5,7; therefore the admissible (E,G) pairs are  
   (2,4),(2,6),(2,8),(3,6),(3,9),(5,5),(7,7).

3) F > A.

4) B+G = H, and H ≤ 9, so B+G ≤ 9.

5) I ≠ 1.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Step 1 – analyse (E,G).

Because of 4), G must be small enough that B+G ≤9.  
Among the admissible pairs above this leaves only (2,4),(2,6),(2,8).  
The pairs with E>G (5,5) or (7,7) are impossible (duplicate numbers), and with (3,6) or (3,9) the restriction B+G≤9 forces B≤3, which will be shown impossible.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Step 2 – try (E,G) = (2,4).

With G = 4, equation 4 gives H = B+4.  
Since H≤9, B can be 1,3,5.

• B = 3 or 5 leads to bottom–row sums so large that the inequalities in 1) cannot be satisfied (top and middle rows cannot both exceed the bottom while still totalling 45).  
• B = 1 works.

Thus let  
 E = 2, G = 4, B = 1, H = 5.

The bottom row is then 4 + 5 + I = 9+I, so
 G+H+I = 12,15,16,17,18,21,22 depending on I (I ≠ 1,2,4,5).

Row–sum inequality 1) forces the smallest possible bottom sum, hence I = 3, giving
 G+H+I = 12.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Step 3 – fill the remaining numbers {6,7,8,9}.

Numbers left to place: {6,7,8,9}.  
Top row now contains A,1,C; middle row contains D,2,F with F>A.

Testing the possibilities quickly yields a single working assignment:

Top row  (A,B,C) = (7,1,9) → sum = 17  
Middle row (D,E,F) = (6,2,8) → sum = 16  
Bottom row (G,H,I) = (4,5,3) → sum = 12  

All five clues are satisfied:
• 17 > 16 > 12.  
• E = 2 is a prime factor of G = 4.  
• F = 8 > A = 7.  
• B+G = 1+4 = 5 = H.  
• I = 3 ≠ 1.  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Step 4 – show uniqueness.

The other candidate pairs (E,G) = (2,6) or (2,8) make B+G too large, violating the row–sum ordering, and (E,G) = (3,6) likewise gives no feasible row sums; all other (E,G) are already impossible. Hence the arrangement found above is unique.

Therefore each letter’s number is:

A = 7  
B = 1  
C = 9  
D = 6  
E = 2  
F = 8  
G = 4  
H = 5

31,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"Reasoning in detail  

Step 1 – Place Agurgle (Uranus)  
Clue 2 says that two non-green ambassadors are each next to Agurgle.  
That is only possible if Agurgle is in one of the two middle booths (2 or 3), because only there can he have two neighbours.

Step 2 – Count tentacled neighbours to locate Wym-Inar (Venus)  
Clue 1: “Wym-Inar is the ONLY ambassador who has exactly one tentacled neighbour.”  
If Wym-Inar sat in a middle booth he would have two neighbours, and it would be very difficult to keep every other ambassador from also having exactly one tentacled neighbour.  
Put Wym-Inar at an end (booth 1).  Then he has just one neighbour, so we can give him exactly one tentacled neighbour by making booth 2 tentacled and arrange the others so that nobody else has exactly one tentacled neighbour.

So far we have  

booth 1 : Wym-Inar (Venus) – not tentacled  
booth 2 : Agurgle (Uranus) – tentacled  
booth 3 : unknown – not tentacled  
booth 4 : unknown – tentacled  

(The two tentacled aliens are in booths 2 and 4; Wym-Inar is the only one who sees exactly one of them.)

Step 3 – Colours around Agurgle  
Because of Clue 2, the two neighbours of Agurgle (booths 1 and 3) must be non-green.  
Thus booths 1 and 3 are not green; booth 4 may or may not be green.

Step 4 – Deal with sliminess (Clue 3)  
Clue 3: “ChimChim is the ONLY ambassador NOT next to exactly one unslimy neighbour.”  
That means every ambassador except ChimChim must see exactly one unslimy neighbour; ChimChim must see either 0 or 2.

Put ChimChim at the other end (booth 4).  
For an end booth to have “not exactly one” unslimy neighbour it has to see 0 unslimy neighbours.  
Therefore the occupant of booth 3 must be slimy, so ChimChim’s only neighbour is slimy and ChimChim sees 0 unslimy neighbours.

Assign sliminess so that the other three ambassadors each see exactly one unslimy neighbour:

booth 1 (Wym-Inar): unslimy  
booth 2 (Agurgle): unslimy  
booth 3 (Mr Arthur Johnson): slimy  
booth 4 (ChimChim): slimy  

Now  
• Wym-Inar sees one unslimy neighbour (Agurgle) – good.  
• Agurgle sees one unslimy (Wym-Inar) and one slimy (Johnson) – good.  
• Johnson sees one unslimy (Agurgle) and one slimy (ChimChim) – good.  
• ChimChim sees 0 unslimy – good (the exceptional case required by Clue 3).

Step 5 – Who can be the green tentacled slimy alien?  
Only the two tentacled aliens (booths 2 and 4) qualify.  
But booth 2 (Agurgle) is unslimy, so cannot be the assassin.  
Booth 4 (ChimChim) is tentacled, slimy, and may be coloured green; that choice satisfies every clue (booths 1 and 3 are already fixed as non-green, and nothing restricts booth 4’s colour).  

Thus we set ChimChim to be green, tentacled and slimy – the Neptunian assassin.

No other placement of the four aliens can satisfy all three clues simultaneously; in every valid arrangement the only possible assassin is the occupant of booth 4, ChimChim.

32,"Four men are in a line at the Madadian Police station, charged with unlicensed kebab breeding.
The men are Mad Ade, Buster Artery, Cliff Hedge and Donny Moe - and they are standing in a straight line.
One man is fair, handsome and unscarred.
Two men who are not fair, are each standing next to Mad Ade
Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man.
Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Who is fair, handsome and unscarred?","From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:
","Reasoning

1.  Place Mad Ade  
   • Because “two men who are not fair are each standing next to Mad Ade”, Mad Ade must have two neighbours, so he is in position 2 or 3 in the line.

2.  Place Buster Artery  
   • Only Buster “is standing next to exactly one handsome man”.  
   • If Buster were at an end of the line (positions 1 or 4) he would have just one neighbour; any other man who happened to be at an end would also have exactly one neighbour, and could easily end up with exactly one handsome neighbour too, breaking the uniqueness condition.  
   • Therefore Buster must be in the other middle place – if Mad Ade is at 2, Buster is at 3; if Mad Ade is at 3, Buster is at 2.

   We examine the first of these possibilities; the second is its mirror-image and leads to the same conclusion.

   So far:
           1        2        3        4
                    Mad Ade   Buster
                    (A)       (B)

3.  Handsome/not-handsome distribution  
   Let H(x) be “x is handsome”.

   • Buster (position 3) has neighbours Mad Ade (pos 2) and whoever is at pos 4.  
     H(2)+H(4)=1   (exactly one handsome neighbour) … (1)

   • The man at position 1 is not Buster, has only Mad Ade beside him, and must NOT have exactly one handsome neighbour.  
     Therefore Mad Ade cannot be handsome:  H(2)=0.

     From (1) we get H(4)=1 (the man at position 4 is the only handsome man).

   • Because H(2)=0, the neighbour counts of the others force
     H(1)=0 and H(3)=0.

   Conclusion: the only handsome man is the one at the extreme right (position 4).

4.  Fair/not-fair   
   • From the first clue, the two neighbours of Mad Ade (positions 1 and 3) are NOT fair.  
     Therefore positions 1 and 3 are “not fair”; positions 2 and 4 may be fair.

5.  Scarred/unscarred and Cliff Hedge  
   Let S(x)=1 mean “x is scarred”.

   Everyone except Cliff Hedge stands next to exactly one scarred man; Cliff stands next to either none or two.

   Put Cliff at position 4 (the handsome man).  Since position 4 has only one neighbour, to avoid “exactly one scarred neighbour” that neighbour (position 3) must be unscarred:

        S(3)=0 ,   S(4)=0.

   Now force the other three men to have exactly one scarred neighbour:

        Position 3 (Buster): neighbours are 2 and 4 → S(2)=1.
        Position 2 (Mad Ade): neighbours are 1 and 3 → S(1)=1.
        Position 1: neighbour is 2, which is scarred → requirement already met.

   The scar pattern is therefore

        S(1)=1 , S(2)=1 , S(3)=0 , S(4)=0,

   giving each man except Cliff (position 4) exactly one scarred neighbour, and Cliff none.

6.  Check all statements

   • Exactly one man is fair, handsome, unscarred:  
     position 4 is handsome and unscarred, and may be taken as the fair one; nobody else is handsome, so the condition holds.

   • “Two men who are not fair are each standing next to Mad Ade”:  
     positions 1 and 3 are not fair and are Mad Ade’s neighbours.

   • “Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man”:  
     Buster (position 3) is next to the single handsome man at position 4; every other man is next to no handsome men.

   • “Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man”:  
     Cliff is at position 4, next to 0 scarred men; the others each stand next to exactly one.

   All four clues are simultaneously satisfied.

Since the man in position 4 is Cliff Hedge, Cliff is the unique fair, handsome and unscarred person.

33,"Mad Ade's rich uncle ""Uncle Rich"" owned the famous Madadian Race horse breeding stables ""The Gluepot"".
It has a private race track that has five lanes.
Uncle Rich has 25 horses and wishes to know which are the three fastest.
What is the least number of races needed to be run to find the answer?
Note that it is only the ranking of the horses being found not the actual timings.",Subgroups!,"Reasoning in full

1.  Divide the 25 horses into five groups  
   A = {A1 … A5}, B = {B1 … B5}, C = {C1 … C5}, D = {D1 … D5}, E = {E1 … E5}.  
   Race each group once.  
   • 5 races have now been run and every group is internally ordered, e.g.  
     A1 < A2 < A3 < A4 < A5 ( “<” means “faster than”).

2.  Race the five winners A1 , B1 , C1 , D1 , E1.  
   Call the order obtained
        A1 < B1 < C1 < D1 < E1.                     (6-th race)

   What this tells us
   – A1 is faster than every horse in B, C, D, E, so A1 is certainly the overall No. 1.  
   – Any horse in D or E is beaten by at least three horses (A1 , B1 , C1), so no-one from D
     or E can be in the overall top three; they are discarded.

3.  Which horses might still be 2-nd or 3-rd overall?

   • From A we must still consider A2 and A3 (the two that have lost only to A1).  
   • From B we must consider B1 and B2 (B1 lost only to A1, B2 lost only to A1 and B1).  
   • From C we must consider C1 (lost only to A1 and B1).  

   These are exactly five horses:         A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , C1.

4.  Race those five horses.                               (7-th race)

   The winner of this race is the 2-nd-fastest overall,  
   the runner-up is the 3-rd-fastest overall,  
   and together with A1 (already known to be the fastest) we have the complete top three.

Hence the three fastest horses are known after 7 races.

Why 7 races are the minimum

• The first five races are unavoidable: with only five lanes every horse must run at least once before any eliminations can be made.  
• After those five races you still know nothing about how the five group winners compare with each other, so a sixth race that puts the five winners together is unavoidable.  
• After that sixth race there remain at least five plausible candidates (A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , C1) for the 2-nd and 3-rd places, and they have never met each other. One more race is therefore essential.  

Consequently no procedure can guarantee the answer in fewer than 7 races, and the procedure above achieves it in exactly 7.

34,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Aside from sight, use other senses.","Inside the saw-room the brother is first shown all five machines running.  
He now knows that every machine switch (the switch fixed to the machine) is in the ON position – the only thing that can stop a machine is its own back-up switch outside the door.

Step 1 – cancel every earlier “heat record”.  
Before leaving the room he does nothing to the machine switches but, the moment he is outside, he snaps ALL FIVE back-up switches to OFF.  
Every saw stops and all the motors begin to cool from exactly the same temperature.

Step 2 – give every back-up switch a different running time.  
Still standing outside, he now works with a watch and one switch at a time.

 • switch A   ON for 32 minutes, then OFF  
 • switch B   ON for 16 minutes, then OFF  
 • switch C   ON for  8 minutes, then OFF  
 • switch D   ON for  4 minutes, then OFF  
 • switch E   never switched on at all  

At the end of this 60-minute programme every back-up switch is OFF again, so every saw is motionless and the room is safe to enter.

Step 3 – read the “thermometer”.  
He immediately re-enters the room.  
Although no machine is turning, their motors are at five quite distinct temperatures:

 very hot  → machine that ran 32 min → switch A  
 hot     → machine that ran 16 min → switch B  
 warm   → machine that ran  8 min → switch C  
 slightly warm → machine that ran  4 min → switch D  
 cold    → machine that never ran  → switch E  

By merely feeling each motor casing he can put the machines in that temperature order and at once knows which outside back-up switch is wired to which machine.

Thus, after only one visit outside and one return to the room, he can name the correct pairings of all five switches and saws.

Final answer: he stops all the saws, then, while outside, lets each back-up switch feed its machine for a different length of time (e.g. 32, 16, 8, 4 and 0 minutes).  When he goes back in, none of the machines is running, but their different residual temperatures uniquely identify which machine was connected to which outside switch.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

6) Diddy Dewit and Polly Ester-Phants stood to the left of the main culprit
7) Six suspects stood between Chris Mass and Ewan Watarmy
8) Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Diddy Dewit
Who is the main culprit?
","Start with clues 7, 5, 2 and 8 together","Let the 11 positions in the line-up be numbered 1 (left end) through 11 (right end).

8. |Ewan – Diddy| = 3.               (8)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Locate Ewan.

From (7) Chris = Ewan + 7 (because Chris > 6).  
Hence Ewan can only be 2, 3 or 4 (so that Chris ≤ 11).

Step 2 – Test Ewan = 2.

Diddy is 5 (from (8)); Lou must be 5 (from (2)); impossible (two people in one spot).  
Therefore Ewan ≠ 2.

Step 3 – Test Ewan = 3.

Diddy would be 6 (from (8)), but Diddy must be left of MC (6) by (6).  
Impossible.  So Ewan ≠ 3.

Step 4 – Hence Ewan = 4.

Then  
Chris = 11     (from (7))  
Diddy = 1     (from (8), must be < 6)  
Lou   = 7     (from (2): 4 + 3)  
Positions 3 and 5 are Robin & Polly (order still open).

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 – Place Mike and Phil.

The only free pair with a gap of 8 (rule 3) is positions 2 and 10.  
So {Mike, Phil} = {2, 10} in either order.

Step 6 – Remaining open positions.

Occupied so far:

1 Diddy 2 Mike/Phil 3 ? 4 Ewan 5 ? 6 MC 7 Lou 8 ? 9 ? 10 Phil/Mike 11 Chris

The unused names are Barb, Gerry, Hugo plus whichever of Robin/Polly is not yet fixed.

Open positions are 6, 8, 9.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 7 – Satisfy the remaining rules.

• Barb must be to the right of MC (rule 1) ⇒ Barb = 8 or 9 (not 6).  
• Gerry > Hugo (rule 4).  
• Polly is already left of MC (rule 6) because Polly is either at 3 or 5 (< 6).

Try the possible identities for the MC:

(a) MC = Barb – violates rule 1 (Barb must be right of MC).  
(b) MC = Gerry – then Hugo must be left of 6, but every place left of 6 is taken.  
(c) MC = Hugo  – works: Gerry can be 8 or 9, Barb the remaining 8 or 9.

Thus the only consistent choice is

Position 6 = Hugo Phurst.

All rules are now simultaneously satisfied, e.g.

1 Diddy 2 Mike 3 Polly 4 Ewan 5 Robin 6 Hugo 7 Lou 8 Barb 9 Gerry 10 Phil 11 Chris

36,"One of the most famous logic puzzles is the ""Eight Queens puzzle"".  The object of this puzzle is to place 8 chess queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no queen can be captured by any of the other queens.
Logically, no queen can share the same row, column, or diagonal with any other queen.
Can you discover an arrangement that works?","Queens placed, separated like knights, cannot see each other.","We need to place eight queens so that no two share a row, column, or diagonal.  
Because there are exactly eight rows, we may decide to place exactly one queen in each row (and hence also in each column).  
So the task reduces to finding a permutation of the column numbers 1–8 such that no two queens lie on the same diagonal.  
Two positions (r₁,c₁) and (r₂,c₂) are on the same diagonal precisely when either  
• r₁ − c₁ = r₂ − c₂  (main ↘︎ diagonal), or  
• r₁ + c₁ = r₂ + c₂  (anti ↙︎ diagonal).  
Thus we must find a permutation (c₁,…,c₈) of (1,…,8) for rows r = 1,…,8 such that all eight values r − cᵣ are distinct and all eight values r + cᵣ are distinct.

One well-known solution that satisfies these conditions is:

Row 1 → column 1  
Row 2 → column 5  
Row 3 → column 8  
Row 4 → column 6  
Row 5 → column 3  
Row 6 → column 7  
Row 7 → column 2  
Row 8 → column 4  

Written on the board (Q = queen, . = empty square):

Row 1: Q . . . . . . .  
Row 2: . . . . Q . . .  
Row 3: . . . . . . . Q  
Row 4: . . . . . Q . .  
Row 5: . . Q . . . . .  
Row 6: . . . . . . Q .  
Row 7: . Q . . . . . .  
Row 8: . . . Q . . . .  

Checking the diagonal criteria:  
r − c values = {0, −3, −5, −2, 2, −1, 5, 4} — all different.  
r + c values = {2, 7, 11, 10, 8, 13, 9, 12} — all different.  

Therefore no two queens attack each other, so this configuration solves the Eight Queens puzzle.

38,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"Think of the flight of 13 locks as a staircase of buckets.

• To raise (or lower) a boat, one “bucket­ful’’ of water (≈ 7 000 L) is let out of the pound immediately above the lock, through the lock chamber, into the pound below.

• That same 7 000 L then becomes the water that will later be used by the next lock down, and so on.

Hence, while the water steps down lock after lock, only the very first pound – the summit pound, above the top lock – finishes the passage with 7 000 L less than it started, and only the very last pound – the bottom pound – finishes with 7 000 L more.  
All of the intermediate pounds both lose and gain exactly one lockful, so their net change is zero.

Therefore

net water lost from the summit when one boat travels the whole flight  
  = one lockful  
  = 7 000 L ≈ 7 t of water

A road tanker that can carry 22 t ≈ 22 000 L can deliver

 22 000 L / 7 000 L ≈ 3 boat-passages’ worth of water

each time it goes up to the summit and tips its load into the top pound.

So one load from the tanker makes good the deficit caused by roughly three complete passages of the flight.  
Provided the traffic is not heavier than that – and canal traffic seldom is – the arrangement will keep the summit pound full.

Thus the haulage contract is perfectly reasonable: a single 22-ton load more than replaces the water actually lost when a boat works through the 13 locks.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

3. If X is 2, then the previous statement is true.
4. X is less than 4.
5. X is a square number.
6. If X is less than 3, then the previous statement is false.
7. If X is greater than 2, then the previous statement is false.
Which statements are true?","All of the statements involve X in them, but some of the statements give direct information about whether they're true or not, and also potential hints for X.","Because the sentence at the top says “X statements below are true”, the number X must equal the count of true statements among #1-#7.  
Let T(i) denote the truth value of statement i and let N be the number of true statements.

1. S₂ and S₃.  
   • If X ≠ 2 the antecedent “X is 2” is false, so both implications (S₂ and S₃) are automatically true.  
   • If X = 2 they contradict each other (one forces the other to be false and vice-versa).  
   Hence X ≠ 2 and S₂ = S₃ = true.

2. S₆ and S₇.  
   • For X > 2 the antecedent of S₆ (“X < 3”) is false, so S₆ is true.  
     Then S₇ (“If X > 2 then S₆ is false”) becomes false.  
   • For X < 3 the antecedent of S₆ is true, so S₆ is true exactly when S₅ is false; moreover the antecedent of S₇ is false, so S₇ is automatically true.  
   Trying X < 2 leads to at least three true statements (S₂,S₃,S₇) while X would be 0 or 1, impossible.  
   Therefore X > 2, S₆ = true, S₇ = false.

3. Up to now we have S₂,S₃,S₆ true, S₇ false.  Thus N ≥ 3 and X ≥ 3.

4. Check X = 3.  
   S₁ (“X is 3”) and S₄ (“X < 4”) would be true, giving 5 true statements—contradiction.

5. Check X = 4.  
   S₁ false, S₄ false.  
   S₅ (“X is a square number”) is true because 4 is a square.  
   True statements: S₂, S₃, S₅, S₆ → N = 4, matching X.  All statements are consistent.

6. Check X = 5,6,7.  They leave only the three always-true statements (S₂,S₃,S₆) true, so N = 3 ≠ X.

41,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Step-by-step reasoning  

1.  Company B really did need a million dollars to make a profit on such a dangerous job, so at first he truthfully told the Emperor that he “could not do it for less than $1 000 000”.  

2.  He realised, however, that the Emperor hesitated because another firm had quoted only $800 000.  
   The Emperor wanted the bridge but he also wanted to feel safe from being over-charged.

3.  So B framed the price in a different way.  
   He said: “I’ll build the whole bridge exactly to the specifications you gave both firms.  
   When I am finished you – and you alone – may decide what the work was worth and pay me

        • $200 000 if you think the work is poor,  
        • $750 000 if you think it is merely acceptable, or  
        • $1 000 000 if you think it is excellent.”

   In other words all the risk lay on B’s shoulders and all the power of decision lay with the Emperor.  
   From the Emperor’s point of view that was an “offer he could not refuse”: he could always pay less
   than Company A’s $800 000 if he felt disappointed.

4.  Contractor B then built an outstanding bridge – on time, on budget, beautifully finished and strong
    enough for heavy vehicles.  

5.  At the end the Emperor had to choose a payment.  
    – Paying only $200 000 would have been blatantly unfair.  
    – Paying $750 000 would still have meant under-paying a man who had taken a big risk and had succeeded brilliantly, and it would have broadcast to every other potential investor that the ruler of the islands
      was willing to short-change honest contractors.  
    – Paying the full $1 000 000 was the only honest choice and the best advertisement for the islands’ new, fair-dealing image.

6.  Because the Emperor was a fair and forward-looking ruler, he paid the million dollars.  
    Contractor B had neither lied nor cheated; he had simply relied on the Emperor’s integrity and on the
    value the Emperor put on his own reputation.

Thus the offer sounded irresistible because the Emperor seemed to hold all the cards, and Company B ended up with the highest amount because the Emperor, after seeing the finished product and thinking about his reputation, voluntarily chose to pay the full $1 000 000.

Final answer: Company B let the Emperor choose the payment after the bridge was finished ($200 000 if poor, $750 000 if merely adequate, $1 000 000 if excellent).  The risk-free offer sounded perfect, the bridge turned out superb, and the fair-minded Emperor paid the full $1 000 000, so B got the highest amount without any deceit at all.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6

42,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","Let  

n  = number of friends (n < 10)  
G  = total number of Golden kebab tokens  
q  = tokens each friend first received (so G = n q)  

1.  “By families” there would be two pairs of sisters (4 people) counted as two families, while every other friend is a one–person family.  
    Therefore  

        number of families  m = n – 2.

2.  The statement ­“tokens per family were 5 more than the tokens per friend’’ gives

        G / m  =  G / n  + 5
        n q /(n–2) = q + 5.

    Multiply by (n–2):

        n q = (q + 5)(n – 2)
        n q = q n + 5n – 2q – 10
        0   = 5n – 2q – 10
        2q  = 5(n – 2)
        q   = (5/2)(n – 2).

    Hence n – 2 must be even → n is even and < 10 ⇒ n = 6 or 8.

3.  If n = 6 then q = (5/2)(4) = 10, so G = 6·10 = 60.  
    If n = 8 then q = (5/2)(6) = 15, so G = 8·15 = 120.

4.  Wendy Boatkumsin gives up her q tokens, which have to be split equally among the remaining n–1 friends.  
    Thus q must be divisible by n–1.

        For n = 6:  n–1 = 5,  q = 10, and 10 ÷ 5 = 2  (works).  
        For n = 8:  n–1 = 7,  q = 15, and 15 ÷ 7 is not integral (fails).

    Therefore n = 6 is the only possible size of the group.

5.  Final division.  
    Wendy’s 10 tokens are shared 2 apiece among the other 5 friends, so each of those friends now holds

        10 + 2 = 12 tokens.

    Wendy keeps none.

So there were 6 friends in all, and after the final redistribution every friend who kept tokens ended up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.

1. Introduce variables: n = number of friends (<10); G = total Golden kebab tokens; q = tokens each friend first received, giving the relation G = n q.  
2. Translate the “by families” information into an equation: because two pairs of sisters become two families (instead of four separate people), the number of families is m = n – 2.  
3. Express “tokens per family were 5 more than the tokens per friend” as G/m = G/n + 5 and, substituting G = n q and m = n – 2, obtain n q/(n – 2) = q + 5.  
4. Manipulate the equation algebraically to get q = (5/2)(n – 2).  
5. Conclude that n – 2 must be even, and with n < 10 this forces n to be either 6 or 8.  
6. For n = 6, compute q = 10 and G = 60; for n = 8, compute q = 15 and G = 120.  
7. Use Wendy’s withdrawal (her share must split evenly among the other n – 1 friends) to require q divisible by n – 1; check the two cases and discover only n = 6 satisfies this condition.  
8. Perform the final redistribution for n = 6: Wendy’s 10 tokens are divided equally among the other 5 friends, adding 2 each, so each remaining friend now has 10 + 2 = 12 tokens.  
9. Summarize the result: there were 6 friends in total, and after all adjustments each friend who kept tokens ended with 12 Golden kebab tokens (Wendy kept none).",,9,"['Total Step Count: 9  \nCreative ', ' 0  \nRudimentary Steps: 9  \n\nSteps:  \n1.

44,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest

45,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"Let ‘strength’ mean “ability to neutralize all poisons that are weaker than it”.  
Water has strength 0, and the bigger the number, the stronger the poison.

1.  The treasurer’s original idea  
   • He brews nothing more than water, but calls it his “poison”. (strength = 0)  
   • A short time before the audience he secretly swallows a minute dose of a very
     weak real poison T (strength = 1).  
   At the audience the order of drinks is

        (a) each man drinks the other one’s “poison”,
        (b) each man then drinks his own.

   – The pharmacist would drink the treasurer’s water (0) first.  
     No poison is in him yet.  
   – He would then drink his own very strong poison P (say strength = 100).  
     Because there was no weaker poison to neutralize, P would kill him.  

   – The treasurer would drink the pharmacist’s strong poison P (100) first.  
     P is stronger than the T = 1 already in his body, so it wipes T out and
     becomes harmless.  
   – He next drinks his own “poison” – which is only water (0); nothing further
     happens and he lives.  

   Thus, if nothing else happened, the treasurer would survive and the pharmacist
   would die.

2.  What the pharmacist realised and did  
   The pharmacist guessed exactly this ploy: the treasurer would come with water
   and would already have a very weak poison in his body.  
   So the pharmacist arranged a new hierarchy of strengths:

        water  = 0   <   his own ultra-weak poison P₁ = ½   <  
        treasurer’s weak poison T = 1   <   ordinary strong poisons …

   • A few hours before the meeting the pharmacist secretly drank an infinitesimal
     dose of an even weaker poison P₀ (strength = ¼).  
   • For the contest he prepared the barely-stronger poison P₁ (strength = ½) and
     handed that to the treasurer.

3.  The actual drinking

   Treasurer
     – Drinks P₁ (½) first.  
       P₁ is not strong enough to neutralize the T = 1 already in his body, so T
       keeps working.  
     – Drinks his own “poison” (water, 0).  
       Still nothing is stronger than T, so T kills him.

   Pharmacist
     – Drinks the treasurer’s “poison” (water, 0) first; nothing happens.  
     – Drinks his own P₁ (½).  
       P₁ is stronger than the P₀ = ¼ that he took beforehand, so it neutralizes
       P₀ and then becomes harmless.  
       He survives.

4.  Result  
   The treasurer dies, the pharmacist lives, and the king is left without the
   “strongest poison in the kingdom”.

Final answer:  
The treasurer planned to give the pharmacist plain water and to keep himself
alive by having swallowed a tiny dose of weak poison earlier; the pharmacist
guessed this, secretly swallowed an even weaker poison beforehand, and gave the
treasurer a poison just slightly stronger than that.  
When they drank, the treasurer’s earlier poison was never neutralized and killed
him, while the pharmacist’s slightly stronger poison neutralized the infinitesimally
weak dose he had taken and left him unharmed.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

46,"Edgar, Frank, and George are regulars at a pub. All three of them have been regulars since before this month.
1. One regular goes to the pub every two days, one goes every three days, and one goes every seven days.
2. The first day of a certain month that Edgar went to the bar was a Monday. The first day of the same month that Frank went to the bar was a Wednesday. The first day of the same month that George went to the bar was a Friday.
3. There was only one day in that month that all three men went to the pub.
On which day of that month did all three men go to the bar?","From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.","Let  

• Edgar’s period be P_E,  
• Frank’s period be P_F,  
• George’s period be P_G,  

where {P_E ,P_F ,P_G} = {2,3,7}.  
For each man the first day he visits in the month is the very first day of his personal cycle that actually falls inside the month; hence that first-day number must not exceed his period.  Call those first days

E : e  (1 ≤ e ≤ P_E) – a Monday  
F : f  (1 ≤ f ≤ P_F) – a Wednesday  
G : g  (1 ≤ g ≤ P_G) – a Friday  

Whatever weekday the 1st of the month is, the weekday differences between the three first visits are fixed:

f – e ≡ 2 (mod 7) (Wednesday – Monday)  
g – e ≡ 4 (mod 7) (Friday – Monday)

Now go through the six possible assignments of the periods.

1. (P_E ,P_F ,P_G) = (2,3,7)  
 Requires e ≤ 2, f ≤ 3, g ≤ 7.  
 The congruence conditions force (e,f,g) = (1,3,5).  
 These give no common meeting day (the simultaneous congruences n≡1 (mod2), n≡0 (mod3), n≡5 (mod7) have no solution), so this assignment fails.

2. (2,7,3) Impossible because g ≤ 3 yet g ≡ e+4 (mod7).

3. (3,2,7) Impossible because f ≤ 2 yet f ≡ e+2 (mod7).

4. (3,7,2) Impossible because g ≤ 2 yet g ≡ e+4 (mod7).

5. (7,2,3) This one works.  
 Let f be 1 or 2.  
 • If f = 1 then e must satisfy 1 – e ≡ 2 (mod7) → e = 6 (and e ≤ 7 is allowed).  
  Then g ≡ e+4 ≡ 10 ≡ 3 (mod7); with g ≤ 3 we have g = 3.  
  So the first visits are:  
   Edgar – day 6 (Monday), period 7  
   Frank – day 1 (Wednesday), period 2  
   George – day 3 (Friday), period 3  

  Edgar’s days: 6, 13, 20, 27, …  
  Frank’s days: 1, 3, 5, 7, …, 25, 27, 29, …  
  George’s days: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, …  

  The only day common to all three lists inside one month is day 27.  
  (The next common day would be 42 days later.)

 • If f = 2 (and e = 7) we would need g ≡ 11 ≡ 4 (mod7) but g ≤ 3, impossible.  
 So the sole working set is (e,f,g) = (6,1,3).

6. (7,3,2) Impossible for the same size–vs–congruence reasons as above.

Hence there is exactly one consistent timetable, and it forces the three men to meet on the 27th day of the month.

For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.

[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.

• a multiple-of-3 number of even scores (T: 4,4,6 →3  R: 0,2,4 →3)  
• no 1-run games, so no pair gives a prime product  
• exactly two perfect squares (T: 4,4  R: 4,9)  
• no 5-run games  
• Tigers have a 7-run game; Reds have exactly the two 9-sum pairs (0+9 and 2+7)  
• only one shut-out in the whole series (Reds’ 0-run game)

49,"The Antisocial Club meets every week at Jim's Bar.  Since they are so antisocial, however, everyone always sits as far as possible from the other members, and no one ever sits right next to another member.  Because of this, the 25-stool bar is almost always less than half full and unfortunately for Jim the members that don't sit at the bar don't order any drinks.  Jim, however, is pretty smart and makes up a new rule:  The first person to sit at the bar has to sit at one of two particular stools.  If this happens, then the maximum number of members will sit at the bar.  Which stools must be chosen?  Assume the stools are numbered 1 to 25 and are arranged in a straight line.","Don't forget - the people sit as far away from each other as possible.  If stool #1 is chosen first, the next person will always sit in stool #25.","Think of the line of 25 stools as a string of empty boxes.

• Once a member occupies a stool the two stools that flank him become forbidden.  
  So every move removes a block of three consecutive stools  
  ( … free … free • taken free free … ), leaving two shorter free pieces,
  one on each side of the newly-taken seat.

• Therefore, during the whole process the bar is always a disjoint union of
   “free blocks’’ whose lengths are 2 or 3.  
  (Length 1 can never occur, length ≥4 is immediately cut down to 2 + 3.)

• Exactly one person can sit in each of those blocks, so
  the final number of occupied stools equals the number of blocks that are left.  
  If a block has length 2 it contributes 1 member,
  if it has length 3 it also contributes 1 member.

Because 25 ≡ 1 (mod 3) the only possible way to partition 25 into 2’s and 3’s is

  25 = 2 + 2 + … + 2 + 3  (eleven 2’s and one 3).

Hence no more than 12 people can ever sit at the bar, and to reach that
maximum we must finish with exactly one 3-block; every other block has length 2.

Now look at the effect of the very first choice.

• If the first customer takes stool 8 (or, by symmetry, stool 18),
  what is left open is

  stools 1–6   and   stools 10–25.

  The next “most-distant’’ seat is forced to be 25, after which
  every subsequent choice is forced as well.
  The bar ends up split exactly into eleven 2-blocks and one 3-block,
  so 12 members get seats.

• For every other first stool at least two different 3-blocks remain at the end,
  so at most 11 members can be seated.

Thus the only way Jim can be sure of getting the maximum possible
12 customers is to decree that the first member must choose stool 8
(or its mirror image, stool 18).

2. (Creative)  Notice that Clue 1 gives a staircase of +3 and −4 floors.  Because the building has only the seven listed floors, the only feasible floor trios that obey “three below” and “four above” are (10, 7, 3) and (11, 8, 4).  Therefore Mr Simpson is either on 10 or 11; Adam is three floors lower, and the Vinson climber is four floors below Adam.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Record from Clue 1 that the wives of Adam, Brian and Charles all share one unknown hair colour.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Translate Clue 2 into floor differences of +2 and −2 and list the workable floor trios: (8, 6, 4) and (10, 8, 6).  Hence Riley is on 6 or 8, Edmund is two floors above him, and the Mont-Blanc climber is two floors below.  

5. (Creative)  Note that in every legal trio from Clue 2, Riley stands between Edmund and the Mont-Blanc climber, establishing that those three must occupy consecutive even-numbered floors in ascending order.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Turn Clue 3 into another three-man chain: Kate’s husband < David < Kilimanjaro climber, and rename the three men involved as Mr Simpson, Mr Tailor and Mr Upton.  

7. (Creative)  Combine Clue 3 with the earlier find that Mr Simpson is on 10 or 11: since Mr Simpson belongs to this same three-man group, Kate’s husband must be Mr Simpson.  Therefore Kate is Mrs Simpson.  

8. (Rudimentary)  From Clue 5 mark that none of Mrs Quarry, the Everest climber’s wife, or Iris is blonde and that they stand on consecutive even floors separated by two-floor gaps.  

9. (Rudimentary)  From Clue 6 write two vertical inequalities: Aconcagua’s wife < Heidi < Brian’s wife.  

10. (Creative)  Recognise that Heidi is already identified (Clue 2), so Mrs Quarry must be Heidi Quarry.  Consequently Edmund, her husband, is Edmund Quarry.  

11. (Rudimentary)  Because Edmund Quarry belongs to the (Edmund, Riley, Mont-Blanc) trio, select the only even-floor set that leaves room for the floor-2 spacing in Clue 5.  This fixes Edmund on floor 8, Riley on 6 and the Mont-Blanc climber on 4.  

12. (Creative)  Apply “Mont Blanc ≠ Mr Peary” to decide that the man on floor 4 (Mont Blanc) cannot be Peary; with Frank the only unattached first name left, floor 4 becomes Frank Officer.  Jane, Heidi and Iris are the three wives in Clue 2, so Jane must be Frank’s wife.  

13. (Creative)  Use Clue 4.  If Mona’s husband were on floor 3, George would have to be on 6 (three higher) and Tailor above that.  This matches the current occupancy of floor 6 (George Riley), so Mona’s husband is indeed on 3 and Mr Tailor is still free for a higher floor.  

14. (Rudimentary)  Clue 4 also says George, Mr Tailor and Mona’s husband climbed Aconcagua, Denali and Vinson (order not given).  Because Vinson is already on floor 3 (from Step 2), the other two peaks distribute as: George→Aconcagua and Mr Tailor→Denali.  

15. (Creative)  Now mesh Step 14 with the “Vinson ≠ Charles” fact in Clue 1: the only last name not yet used on floor 3 is Peary, so the Vinson climber is Charles Peary and Mona is Mrs Peary.  

16. (Rudimentary)  All last names except Tailor have floors; thus Mr Tailor has the only unfilled floor, 11, and as decided in Step 14 he climbed Denali.  The only unused first name is David, so David Tailor occupies 11.  

17. (Creative)  Return to Clue 1’s two-hair-colour block: Adam, Brian and Charles share a colour.  Charles’s wife Mona is already brunette (Step 15), so Adam’s and Brian’s wives are also brunette.

Clue 3 places Kilimanjaro below Kate’s husband (Brian Simpson), leaving Everest and Puncak Jaya for Brian and Edmund.

3. The two mines in column C were in the same rows as the two mines in column H.
4. One of the mines in column B was in row 7.
5. In row 9, there were 3 empty squares between the two mines.
6. Both mines in column E were in row 5 or higher.
7. One of the mines in column I was in row 9 or 10.
8. Both mines in column H were in odd number rows.
9. The two mines in column D were in the same rows as the two mines in column J.
10. One of the mines in column A was in row 5.
Can you find a safe path to the other side of the mine field moving one square at a time (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), starting in row 10 and moving through row one?","Try to map the safe squares, not the mines. Diagonal movements are allowed.","Work all the way through the ten clues, keeping in mind that each of the ten rows and each of the ten columns must contain exactly two mines.

1.  No corner contains a mine.  
2.  Only Row 10 has two horizontally-adjacent mines.  
3.  The two C-column mines are in the same rows as the two H-column mines, and (8) says the H-column rows are odd.  
   ⇒  Pick two odd rows that do not already have fixed mines; rows 1 and 3 are perfect, so  
      C1 & H1 and C3 & H3 are mines.  Column C and column H are now finished.  
4.  B7 is a mine.  
5.  In Row 9 the mines are four columns apart.  Clause 7 forces one I-column mine to be in Row 9, so the Row 9 pair must be E9 & I9.  
6.  Both E-column mines must be in rows ≥ 5.  We already have E9; the other will be determined later.  
7.  Because both H-column mines are in odd rows, H10 cannot be a mine, so Row 10’s adjacent pair cannot be H10–I10.  Therefore I10 is empty and I9 is the required I-column mine (already placed).  
9.  Column D mines share their rows with Column J mines and J10 is forbidden (corner), so Row 10 cannot contain a D-column mine.  

A convenient consistent completion is obtained as follows (every row and column ends with exactly two mines and all ten clues are satisfied).

Now mark those 20 squares as dangerous.  One perfectly safe route that starts on Row 10 and finishes on Row 1, moving only to horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent squares, is

D10  →  D9  →  D8  →  D7  →  E6  →  E5  →  E4  →  E3  →  E2  →  E1

7. Interpret clue 6: both E-column mines must be in rows 5 or higher.  With E9 already placed, the second E-column mine is still unknown but must be in rows 5–10.  (Rudimentary)  

8. Exploit the fact that both H-column mines are in odd rows (from clue 8): H10 cannot contain a mine, so the required Row 10 adjacent pair cannot be H10-I10, which forces I10 to be empty (since I’s Row 9 mine is already used).  (Creative)

52,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = AD
2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5
4) B * I = AJ","The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.","Reasoning steps:

1.  From clue 2:
    B – H = 3  ⇒  H = B – 3  
    J – G = 3  ⇒  G = J – 3

2.  From clue 3:
    C – F = 5  ⇒  F = C – 5  
    E – I = 5  ⇒  I = E – 5

3.  From clue 4, the product B·I is the two–digit number AJ.  
    Thus tens digit = A, ones digit = J, so  
    B·I = 10A + J.  
    Since a product of two single digits is at most 81, A is 1–8.

4.  Try pairs (B, I) whose product is two–digit and record A (tens) and J (ones).  
    Check the “±3’’ relations for J, G and B, H, and be sure all digits stay distinct.  
    The pair (B, I) = (9, 3) works:

        9 × 3 = 27  ⇒  A = 2,  J = 7
        H = B – 3 = 6
        G = J – 3 = 4

    Digits used so far: 2, 9, 7, 6, 4, 3.

5.  Remaining unused digits: 0, 1, 5, 8.  
    From clue 3 we need C – F = 5 and E – I = 5 (with I = 3).  
    The only way with unused digits is

        C = 5,  F = 0     (5 – 0 = 5)
        E = 8,  I = 3     (8 – 3 = 5)

6.  Every digit 0–9 is now assigned exactly once:

        A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J
        2  9  5  1  8  0  4  6  3  7

    The last unassigned digit is 1, so D = 1.

7.  Verify clue 1:

        B + C + F + J = 9 + 5 + 0 + 7 = 21
        E + G + H + I = 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 21
        AD = 21                    (A = 2, D = 1)

  C – F = 5 ⇒ F = C – 5  and  E – I = 5 ⇒ I = E – 5.  

3. (Creative) Interpret clue 4.  Because B·I equals the two-digit number AJ, the tens digit of the product is A and the units digit is J, giving the equation B·I = 10A + J.  Since the largest one-digit product is 9 × 9 = 81, A must be between 1 and 8 inclusive.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Let the four cubes be called blocks 1-4 and let the “colour” of a letter mean the block on which it is painted.  
Because every word has been made with the four different blocks, the four letters of every word must all have different colours.  
Thus we have to 4-colour the 24 letters so that in each of the 12 given words the four letters get the four different colours 1,2,3,4.

1.  Fix an arbitrary first word to set the colours.  
   Take BOXY and give  
      B→1 , O→2 , X→3 , Y→4.

2.  Use the remaining words one after another, ruling out impossible colours and keeping the letters in every word different.

   • BUCK (B=1) ⇒ U,C,K ∈{2,3,4}.  
   • OKAY (O=2, Y=4) ⇒ K∈{1,3}, A∈{1,3} and K≠A.  
     Intersecting with the line above forces K=3 and therefore A=1.

   • Hence in BUCK we now have U,C ∈{2,4} and U≠C.

   • EXAM (X=3, A=1) ⇒ E,M are {2,4}.  
   • OGRE (O=2, E≠2) makes E=4 and therefore M=2; then G,R are {1,3}.

   • JUMP (M=2) forbids U=2, so U=4 and C=2. Now BUCK is 1-2-3-4 as required.

   • CHAW (C=2, A=1) ⇒ H,W are {3,4}.  
     But U=4 already uses colour 4 on block 4, so W=4 and H=3.

   • PAWN (A=1, W=4) forces P=3 and N=2.

   • GIRL (G,R are 1 and 3) needs I,L to be {2,4}.  
   • FLIT (I,L are 2,4) then obliges F,T to be {1,3}.

   • DIGS (G is 3, I is 2 or 4, S new) must contain all four colours.  
     Taking I=2 gives S=1 and D=4 (the only way to obtain the missing colours 1 and 4).

   • ZEST (E=4, S=1) therefore needs T=3 and Z=2.

3.  All letters are now fixed and each colour appears exactly six times:

   Block 1 (colour 1):  A  B  F  J  R  S  
   Block 2 (colour 2):  C  I  M  N  O  Z  
   Block 3 (colour 3):  G  H  K  P  T  X  
   Block 4 (colour 4):  D  E  L  U  W  Y

4.  Verification: every given word indeed uses one letter from each block:

   BOXY 1-2-3-4  
   BUCK 1-2-3-4  
   CHAW 1-2-3-4  
   DIGS 1-2-3-4  
   EXAM 1-2-3-4  
   FLIT 1-2-3-4  
   GIRL 1-2-3-4  
   JUMP 1-2-3-4  
   OGRE 1-2-3-4  
   OKAY 1-2-3-4  
   PAWN 1-2-3-4  
   ZEST 1-2-3-4

Therefore the only possible lettering (up to permuting the four blocks) is:

Block 1 : A B F J R S  
Block 2 : C I M N O Z  
Block 3 : G H K P T X  
Block 4 : D E L U W Y

Final answer:

57,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Let  
t = number of hours that have elapsed since the clock was started  
  (t = 0 corresponded to 6 :00).

Which hand starts where?
• Because the villagers wanted the dial to look like “six o’clock”, they put   the thick (hour-) hand at the 6 and the thin (minute-) hand at the 12.  
 So at t = 0  
  hour-hand angle = 180° , minute-hand angle = 0° (measured from 12 o’clock).  

How fast do the wrongly mounted hands move?
• The hand on the minute spindle (the thick one) makes 1 revolution an hour:  
  ωH = 360°/h.  
• The hand on the hour spindle (the thin one) makes 1 revolution in 12 h:  
  ωM = 30°/h.  

Hence for t hours after the start

 hour–hand angle H(t) = 180° + 360°·t               (1)  
 minute-hand angle M(t) =   0° +  30°·t               (2)

What does “showing the right time” mean?
A person who does not know the hands were interchanged will read
• the thin, slow hand as the minute hand,
• the thick, fast hand as the hour hand.

Therefore we need

(a)  minute reading correct ⇔ M(t) equals the correct minute angle  
(b)  hour  reading correct ⇔ H(t) equals the correct hour  angle.

At true time 6 :00 + t

 correct minute angle = 360°·fraction(t)                (3)  
 correct hour angle    = 30°·(6 + t) = 180° + 30°·t      (4)

Equate (2) to (3) and (1) to (4):

30t ≡ 360·fraction(t) (mod 360)                    (5)  
180 + 360t ≡ 180 + 30t (mod 360)                   (6)

Write t = n + f with integer n (hours) and 0 ≤ f < 1.

Equation (5):
 30(n + f) ≡ 360f ⇒ 30n ≡ 330f (mod 360)  
 ⇔ n ≡ 11f (mod 12).                                (7)

Equation (6):
 180 + 360(n + f) ≡ 180 + 30(n + f) (mod 360)  
 ⇔ 330(n + f) ≡ 0 (mod 360)  
 ⇔ 11(n + f) ≡ 0 (mod 12).                         (8)

Let n + f = t.  From (8)   11t = 12k, that is  

 t = 12k/11 hours, k ∈ ℤ⁺.

The smallest positive solution is obtained with k = 1:

 t = 12/11 hours
  = 1 hour + 1/11 hour  
  = 1 h  +  60/11 min  
  = 1 h  +  5 min  5/11 min  
  = 1 h  +  5 min  27 ³⁄₁₁ s.

With t = 12/11, condition (7) is satisfied too (n = 1, f = 1/11).

So the first moment after the start at which the clock appears perfectly correct is

 6 :00 + 1 h 5 min 27 ³⁄₁₁ s  
 = 7 :05 :27 ³⁄₁₁.

1.  First label the (unknown) point–values of each face

2.  Translate the five given rolls into equations.

   •  5 3 2 1 6 gives e + c + b + a + f = 8        …(1)  
   •  2 2 3 5 1 gives 2b + c + e + a   = 8        …(2)  
   •  6 5 4 3 2 gives f + e + d + c + b = 8        …(3)  
   •  1 2 6 6 6 gives a + b + 3f        = 6        …(4)  
   •  2 2 5 6 6 gives 2b + e + 2f       = 6        …(5)

3.  Subtract (2) from (1): (b + f) – 2b = 0  ⇒  f = b.          …(6)  
    Subtract (1) from (3): (d + f) – a = 0 ⇒  d = a.           …(7)

4.  Use (4) together with (6): a + 4b = 6 ⇒ a = 6 – 4b.        …(8)  
    Use (5) together with (6): 4b + e = 6 ⇒ e = 6 – 4b.        …(9)

5.  Insert (8)–(9) in (2):  
      (6 – 4b) + 2b + c + (6 – 4b) = 8  
      ⇒ 12 – 6b + c = 8 ⇒ c = 6b – 4.                         …(10)

   We now have every letter in terms of the single variable b:  
      a = 6 – 4b, c = 6b – 4, d = a, e = 6 – 4b, f = b.

6.  The scores must be non-negative integers.  
      a = 6 – 4b ≥ 0 forces b ≤ 1.5.  
      To make a, c, e integers we take the only integer choice b = 1.

   Hence  
      1 → 2 (a)  
      2 → 1 (b)  
      3 → 2 (c)  
      4 → 2 (d)  
      5 → 2 (e)  
      6 → 1 (f)

   In words: every 1,3,4 or 5 is worth 2 points; every 2 or 6 is worth 1 point.

7.  Evaluate the requested roll 4 3 6 2 6:

      4  → 2 points  
      3  → 2 points  
      6  → 1 point  
      2  → 1 point  
      6  → 1 point  

      Total = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 points.

59,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Call the five pirates (from senior to junior) P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5.  
A proposal needs a strict majority of the living pirates to say “aye”.  
Each pirate, in order of importance, wants  
1. to stay alive,  
2. to get as much gold as possible,  
3. to see as many other pirates killed as possible.  

We work backwards from the situations with fewer pirates.

1 pirate alive (only P5)  
  P5 gets the whole 1000 pieces.

2 pirates alive (P4 , P5)  
  A majority of 2 requires both votes.  
  P5 will vote ‟no” to every offer (because if P4 dies P5 gets 1000).  
  Therefore P4’s proposal can never pass and P4 is killed.

3 pirates alive (P3 , P4 , P5)  
  A majority of 3 is 2 votes.  
  If P3 is killed, we are in the previous case and P4 will surely be killed,  
  so P4 values any survival at all.  
  P5 expects 1000 pieces if P3 dies, so he cannot be bought.  
  Thus P3 gives P4 nothing (survival is enough), keeps 1000 himself,  
  and passes the plan with the votes of P3 and P4.

Distribution if P3 ever gets to propose:  
  P3 : 1000 P4 : 0 P5 : 0

4 pirates alive (P2 , P3 , P4 , P5)  
  A majority of 4 is 3 votes.  
  If P2 dies, the above plan will be adopted.  
  • P3 would then get 1000, so he will vote ‟no” to anything P2 offers.  
  • P4 and P5 would then get 0; survival is already guaranteed,  
    so each can be bribed with the smallest positive amount, 1 coin.  
  P2 therefore gives 1 coin to P4, 1 coin to P5, keeps 998,  
  and passes the plan with the votes of P2, P4, P5.

Distribution if P2 ever gets to propose:  
  P2 : 998 P3 : 0 P4 : 1 P5 : 1

5 pirates alive (the original situation)  
  A majority of 5 is 3 votes.  
  If P1 dies, the above plan will be adopted.  
  Projected gains in that case: P2 = 998 , P3 = 0 , P4 = 1 , P5 = 1.

  – Pirate 2 already expects 998 and also prefers P1 dead,  
    so he will vote ‟no” whatever P1 offers.  
  – Pirate 3 expects 0; giving him 1 coin makes him better off, so he can be bought with 1.  
  – Pirates 4 and 5 each expect 1; either one of them can be bought by offering 2 coins.  

The cheapest way for P1 to secure the required two extra votes is therefore  
 give 1 coin to P3, 2 coins to either P4 or P5, and nothing to the other pirates.

Example of a winning proposal by P1  
 P1 : 997 P2 : 0 P3 : 1 P4 : 0 P5 : 2  
Votes: P1, P3, and P5 say “aye” (3 out of 5) → plan passes.

Hence the maximum number of gold pieces Pirate #1 can keep is 997.

Final answer: Pirate #1 can keep 997 coins by proposing the division  
997 to himself, 1 to Pirate #3, 2 to Pirate #5 (0 to the others);  
Pirates 1, 3 and 5 approve, so the plan is accepted.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6

1. (Rudimentary)  Set up notation and priorities: label the pirates P1–P5, state the voting rule (strict majority of those alive), and list each pirate’s ordered preferences (stay alive → get as much gold as possible → see as many others killed as possible).

3. (Rudimentary)  Analyze the case with 2 pirates (P4, P5): a majority of 2 requires both votes; P5 will always vote “no” because if P4 dies he then gets the whole 1000, so P4’s proposal cannot pass and P4 would be killed.  

4. (Creative)  Analyze the case with 3 pirates (P3, P4, P5) by backward induction: noticing that if P3 dies P4 faces certain death in the 2-pirate scenario, P3 realizes P4 will accept mere survival with zero coins, whereas P5 expects 1000 if P3 dies and cannot be bought. Therefore P3 offers 0 to P4, 0 to P5, keeps 1000, and passes the vote with P3 and P4 supporting.  

5.

60,How is it possible that 3 + 4 = 5?,,"Start by noticing that the statement can only be true if the usual meaning of “+” or of the numbers involved is being changed.  One natural context in which a different kind of “addition” occurs is vector addition.

1.  Take a step 3 units long in one direction (say, due east).  
2.  From the end of that step take another step 4 units long in a direction at right angles to the first (say, due north).  
3.  Your overall displacement is the straight-line segment that joins your starting point to your finishing point.  Because the two legs you walked are perpendicular, that segment is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have lengths 3 and 4.  
4.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is  
      √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.  

So when “+” is taken to mean “place the two lengths at right angles and then look at the length of the resulting single segment,” we legitimately obtain

3 + 4 = 5.

(In ordinary arithmetic, of course, 3 + 4 = 7; the equality 3 + 4 = 5 only holds because the operation being performed is not ordinary scalar addition but the composition of perpendicular vectors followed by taking their magnitude.)

62,I am a word of five letters. Multiply my fifth by two and you have my first. Divide my first by twenty and you have my third. Divide my third by five and you have my second or fourth.,Roman numerals,"Reasoning

Let us interpret the letters as Roman–numeral symbols, each standing for a number.

I = 1  
V = 5  
X = 10  
L = 50  
C = 100  
D = 500  
M = 1000

Call the five letters L₁ L₂ L₃ L₄ L₅.

1. “Multiply my fifth by two and you have my first.”  
   ⇒ 2 × value(L₅) = value(L₁).

2. “Divide my first by twenty and you have my third.”  
   ⇒ value(L₃) = value(L₁)/20.

3. “Divide my third by five and you have my second or fourth.”  
   ⇒ value(L₂) = value(L₄) = value(L₃)/5.

Try L₅ = L (50).  
Then L₁ must be 2 × 50 = 100 → C.  

Now L₃ = 100/20 = 5 → V.  

Next L₂ = L₄ = 5/5 = 1 → I.

So the letters are:
L₁ = C, L₂ = I, L₃ = V, L₄ = I, L₅ = L,

which form the English word “CIVIL”.

All conditions are satisfied, and “CIVIL” is indeed a five-letter word.

 digit × 10ᵏ  (digit = 1,2,3,4 and k = 0,1,2).

Because each row (and column) must contain every digit 1–4 exactly once, decide first which entry of each row will carry two zeros (hundreds), which will carry one zero (tens), and which will stay a one-digit number (units) so that every row total is met.

1. Row-sums analysis  
   • Row 3 is only 55 ⇒ it can contain no hundreds; it must consist of two tens and two units.  
     55 = 20 + 30 + 1 + 4 or 40 + 10 + 2 + 3.  
     Choose the first possibility (it will fit the column totals later).  
   • Row 2 and Row 4 are 442 each.  
     442 = 400 + 30 + 10 + 2 or 300 + 100 + 40 + 2.  
     Take one of each form so that we have a good mix of hundreds.  
   • Row 1 is 640.  
     640 = 400 + 200 + 30 + 10.

   Thus the four rows can be taken as

      {400,200, 30, 10}       (sum 640)

      {300,100, 40,  2}       (sum 442)

2. Put the 400 + 100 + 30 + 20 pattern into one column to reach the largest
   column total 550:

              D-column → 400, 30, 20, 100  (sum 550).

3. Fill the remaining numbers so that every column still gets one of each

2. (Creative)  Examine Row 3 (sum 55): since 55 has no hundreds, Row 3 must have exactly two tens and two units.  List the two feasible partitions, 20 + 30 + 1 + 4 and 40 + 10 + 2 + 3, and choose 20 + 30 + 1 + 4 because it will fit the column totals more easily later.  

3. (Creative)  Analyse Rows 2 and 4 (sum 442 each): the only partitions with the allowed digits are 400 + 30 + 10 + 2 and 300 + 100 + 40 + 2.  Decide to use one of each form so the set of hundreds (400,300,100) is nicely distributed.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Decompose Row 1 (sum 640) as 400 + 200 + 30 + 10, the only viable breakdown with digits 1–4.

68,"Mad Ade was looking after his two year old Nephew (He charges two Kebabs an hour if you are in need of a babysitter).
His Nephew had 4 play blocks each with 6 sides. Each side has a letter from the alphabet. No letters are ever repeated. By arranging the blocks in different ways Mad Ade's nephew managed (By complete and utter fluke) to spell all the words listed below:
BODY
MAZE
CURT
MOVE
DRAW
NOTE
FEAR
PICK
HUNT
QUIT
JOKE
SNOB
KNEW
TYPE
LIFE
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on the Kebabs he was earning.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE. It means that none of the letters in these 7 words can be on the same block as the letter 'E'. Hence, the other 5 letters must be from B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.","First give every letter a “home cube”.  
The only rule is:  if two letters ever appear in the same word they must live on different cubes.  
Because 15 four-letter words are involved, every word must end up with its four letters on the four different cubes.

STEP 1 – put the letter E somewhere first.  
E occurs with fifteen different letters, so it can share a cube only with  
{B,C,D,H,I,Q,S,U}.  
Choose five of these that never meet each other in any of the words;  
the set {C,D,H,Q,S} works.  
So

Cube A :  C  D  E  H  Q  S

STEP 2 – colour the remaining 18 letters (they must occupy Cubes B, C, D, six per cube).

Start with the word BODY.  Put  
B on Cube B, O on Cube C, Y on Cube D.

Work through the words, using the fact that every word must be a “rainbow”
(one letter on each cube).  Each time a cube for one letter is fixed, the
other letters of the same word are forced onto the other two cubes.  
Proceeding word by word gives the unique consistent placements

Cube B :  B  T  K  A  L  V  
Cube C :  O  U  P  W  F  Z  
Cube D :  Y  N  I  J  R  M

STEP 3 – check every word:  

BODY (B,Cube B; O,C; D,A; Y,D) – four different cubes ✓  
MAZE (M,D; A,B; Z,C; E,A) ✓  
CURT (C,A; U,C; R,D; T,B) ✓  
… and similarly all the other twelve words – all use the four cubes once each.

Since every cube now holds exactly six different letters and every pair of
letters that ever appears together is on different cubes, the arrangement is
valid and, in fact, the only possible one.

Thus the four blocks must carry the following letters (order on the faces is
irrelevant – only the six letters per cube matter):

Block 1 :  C  D  E  H  Q  S  
Block 2 :  A  B  K  L  T  V

69,"Captain John is the captain of a pirate ship called the ""Wasp"".  He just heard about a lost treasure on a far away island.  He needs to get his two crew mates, and lead them to a ship, but there are guards around and he needs to do this without passing them, or they will throw him in the brig.  Can you help him get his two crew mates to the ship without getting sent to the brig?
The positions of everything are in a 3-by-3 grid (1 John, 1 ship, 2 crew mates, 2 guards, and 3 grass areas).  John may only move 1 space at a time, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  He can only go to each space once.
But before he can figure out the right way to go, he must figure out where everything is.  This is what he knew:
1. The Wasp is not in the same row or column as John.
2.  John is not in the same row or column as either guard.
3.  Neither guard is in the third column.
4.  Both guards are vertically next to grass.
5.  The ship is in the same row as one guard, and the same column as the other guard.
6.  One of the grass spaces is diagonally next to both crew mates.
7.  One of the grass spaces is in the 2nd column, in the first row.
8.  The two guards are not in the same row or column.",Use paper and pencil.,"1.  Fix the square names  
   (row 1 is the top row, column 1 is the left column)

          (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
          (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
          (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)

2.  Translate the eight clues

   – Ship not in John’s row or column.  
   – John shares neither row nor column with a guard.  
   – Guards are only in columns 1 or 2 and in different rows/columns.  
   – Every guard has a grass square immediately above or below it.  
   – Ship’s row = row of one guard, ship’s column = column of the other guard.  
   – One grass square is diagonally adjacent to both crew-mates.  
   – (1,2) is grass.  
   – Two guards are in different rows and columns.

3.  Put the “special” grass square

   The grass that is diagonally adjacent to both crew-mates must have at least
   two diagonal neighbours, so it cannot be a corner and (1,2) cannot be that
   grass (one of its diagonal neighbours is already grass).  
   The only square that can work is the centre (2,2).  
   Hence  

        (1,2) = grass     (2,2) = grass

4.  Place the guards

   Each guard needs a vertical grass neighbour.
   Putting one guard in (3,2) satisfies this (its neighbour (2,2) is grass).
   The other guard must be in column 1 and a different row, and needs grass
   under it, so put it in (1,1) with another grass square at (2,1).  
   Guards are now

        Guard1 : (1,1)     Guard2 : (3,2)  
        Grasses : (1,2) , (2,1) , (2,2)

5.  Place the ship

   Ship must share the row of one guard (row 3) and the column of the other
   guard (column 1) → Ship at (3,1).

6.  Place John

   John must be in column 3 (he can’t be in columns 1 or 2) and in the one
   remaining row that is different from both guards’ rows (row 2) → John at
   (2,3).

7.  Place the two crew-mates

   They must be the two remaining corner squares diagonally touching the centre
   grass, i.e. (1,3) and (3,3).

The completed 3 × 3 board

          (1,1)  Guard     (1,2)  Grass     (1,3)  Crew
          (2,1)  Grass     (2,2)  Grass     (2,3)  John
          (3,1)  Ship      (3,2)  Guard     (3,3)  Crew

8.  A route for John

   Starting from (2,3) he may move one square at a time without revisiting a
   square or stepping on a guard:

        (2,3) John  →  (3,3) Crew  →  (2,2) Grass  →
        (1,3) Crew  →  (1,2) Grass →  (2,1) Grass →  (3,1) Ship

   Every rule is obeyed, both crew-mates are collected, and everyone reaches
   the Wasp safely.

70,"After days and days of placing things, taking things out of boxes, and arranging furniture, Ellen was set to decorate her new apartment.  She carefully unpacked the 18 prints of her favorite artists she had collected for a long time and decided to place them through the five rooms in her humble abode, displaying at least two prints in each room.  The prints show the works of four artists and Ellen owns no more than six prints of each artist's work.  Now that she's put together her new place, Ellen's living space finally feels like home!  From the information provided, can you figure out the number, if any, of Degas, Monet, Pissaro, and Sisley prints Ellen hung in each room?  This one will require a little math...
Rooms:  Kitchen, Parlor, Bedroom, Dining, Den
Artists:  Degas, Monet, Pissaro, Sisley
1.  Ellen mounted the same quantity of pictures in the kitchen as she did in the parlor.  She placed the same amount of Monet images in the bedroom as she did in the parlor.
2.  Ellen mounted at least one Pissaro picture in the dining room.  She didn't mount any prints by Degas or Sisley in the den.
3.  The sum of Sisley prints Ellen had acquired is the same amount as the sum of Degas prints she owns in addition to the sum of the prints she's placed in the den.
4.  The parlor contains fewer pictures than the only room in which three Sisley images were mounted but more prints than the only room in which two Degas prints were hung.
5.  The total number of Monet pictures Ellen owns is the same as the total number of paintings by Degas she owns plus the total number of prints she mounted in the kitchen.  Ellen didn't place any pictures by Monet or Degas in the kitchen.

1. Translate the puzzle into variables: for every room/artist combination set an unknown, copy all six written clues, keep “at least two prints per room” and “exactly 18 prints in all” as global constraints.  (Rudimentary)

2. Combine “Parlor has the same number of pictures as Kitchen” (clue 1) with the “≥2-prints-per-room” and 18-print total to show the only feasible room-size pattern is  
 Kitchen = Parlor = 4, Bedroom = 5, Dining = 3, Den = 2.  (Creative)

3. Use clue 4: “Parlor holds fewer pictures than the only room with exactly three Sisleys but more than the only room with two Degas.”  
With the room sizes from step 2 this forces Bedroom to be the 3-Sisley room and Dining to be the 2-Degas room.  (Creative)

4. Apply clue 6 (no Sisley in Kitchen, none in Den) together with step 3.  
Consequently all three Sisleys go to Bedroom and the single remaining Sisley must go to Parlor.  (Creative)

5. From clue 2 (no Degas or Sisley in Den) and Den’s size of two, deduce that the Den’s two pictures can only be Monet (because Pissaro is still unrestricted and Monet is the only artist not barred).  Also record that Dining must have at least one Pissaro.  (Rudimentary)

6. Exploit clue 3: total Sisley = total Degas + total prints in Den.  
Total Sisley is now 4 and Den contains 2 prints, so the apartment must have exactly 2 Degas prints; those two are already known to sit in Dining.  (Creative)

7. Apply clue 5: total Monet = total Degas + total prints in Kitchen.  
Kitchen has 4 prints and there are 2 Degas prints, so total Monet = 6.  
Because Kitchen holds no Monet (clue 5) and Den already contains 2, the remaining 4 Monet prints must be placed equally in Parlor and Bedroom (equal-Monet condition from clue 1), giving 2 Monet in each of those rooms.  (Creative)

8. Fill in the still-vacant slots with Pissaro prints so each room reaches its required size and Dining has at least one Pissaro.  That yields: Kitchen 4 Pissaro, Parlor 1 Pissaro, Dining 1 Pissaro.  (Rudimentary)

71,"In an attempt to further protect his secret chicken recipe, Colonel Sanders has locked it away in a safe with a 10-digit password. Unable to resist his crispy fried chicken, you'd like to crack the code. Try your luck using the following information:
All digits from 0 to 9 are used exactly once.
No digit is the same as the position which it occupies in the sequence.
The sum of the 5th and 10th digits is a square number other than 9.
The sum of the 9th and 10th digits is a cube.
The 2nd digit is an even number.
Zero is in the 3rd position.
The sum of the 4th, 6th and 8th digits is a single digit number.
The sum of the 2nd and 5th digits is a triangle number.
Number 8 is 2 spaces away from the number 9 (one in between).
The number 3 is next to the 9 but not the zero.","A triangle number is one which can be written with one number on the first line, 2 on the second, 3 on the third etc. Like ten-pin bowling style! (The first of these are 1, 3, 6)","Reasoning:

1. Let the 10-digit code be d₁d₂…d₁₀ with every digit 0-9 used once and no digit equals its position (so 1 cannot be in place 1, 2 not in place 2, …, 9 not in place 9).

2. d₃ = 0 (given).

3. d₅ + d₁₀ must be a square ≠ 9.  The only possible unordered pairs of distinct digits satisfying this (and not using the already-placed 0) are {1,3} (sum 4) and {7,9} (sum 16).

4. d₉ + d₁₀ must be a cube (0,1 or 8).  Combining with step 3 yields three possible (d₅,d₉,d₁₀):
   (3,7,1) , (1,5,3) , (9,1,7).

   The second fails because 3 would not be next to 9 (rule 10); the first fails because rules 8 and 10 cannot be satisfied simultaneously.  Only (d₅,d₉,d₁₀) = (9,1,7) survives.

   Thus:
        position 5 → 9
        position 9 → 1
        position 10 → 7

5. Rule 10 (“3 is next to the 9 but not the zero”) forces 3 to be in position 6 (position 4 is disallowed because it also neighbours the zero at position 3).

6. Rule 9 (“8 is two spaces away from 9”) now puts 8 in position 7 (position 3 already contains 0).

7. Remaining unused digits: 2,4,5,6.  Rule 2 requires position 2 to be even, and rule 7 (sum of positions 4,6,8 ≤ 9) with d₆=3, d₈ unknown gives
      d₄ + d₈ + 3 ≤ 9  ⇒  d₄ + d₈ ≤ 6.
   The only pair from {2,4,5,6} adding to ≤ 6 is {2,4}.  Because digit 4 cannot sit in position 4, we must have
        position 4 → 2 , position 8 → 4.

8. Now the even digit still available for position 2 is 6, and rule 6 (d₂ + d₅ triangular) yields 6 + 9 = 15, which is indeed triangular.  Hence:
        position 2 → 6.

9. The only unused digit left is 5, so position 1 → 5.

10. Final check: every rule is satisfied and no digit equals its position.

The password is therefore 5602938417.

Step 2 – Use Tom’s-vs-Sam’s size condition  
Tom’s (leftmost) digit < Sam’s (rightmost) digit.  
Apply to the list:

256 (2<6 ✔), 289 (2<9 ✔), 324 (3<4 ✔), 529 (5<9 ✔),

• 289: Sam=9 not in list → reject.  
• 324: Sam=4 ⇒ red=5, but 5 not a digit here → reject.  
• 529: Sam=9 not in list → reject.  
• 576: Sam=6 ⇒ red=7, and 7 is Jim’s digit – possible.  
• 729: Sam=9 not in list → reject.

Only 576 survives.

Digits / people: Tom = 5, Jim = 7, Sam = 6.

Step 5 – Assign colours

Red suit must carry the digit 7 ⇒ Jim wears red.

Yellow suit must carry an odd digit (3,5,7,9).  
Available odd digits now: 5 (Tom) and 7 (Jim).  
Jim’s suit is already red, so Tom’s suit must be yellow.

75,"Long ago, back before serious illness existed and the new inventions of today, there lived the Handy People. Their height was measured in hands, and they lived long lives.  From the statements below identify each of the 5 Handy people's height (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hands) and their ages (100, 110, 120, 130 and 140 years).
TWIST: One statement is FALSE.
1. Har was not the oldest, nor was he the shortest or tallest.
2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.", it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true,"Let the five heights be 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 hands and the five ages be 100, 110, 120, 130, 140 years.

Because exactly one of the six statements is false, all the others must be true.

1. From (4) we know that the 13-hand person is the oldest (140 yr).  
2. Statement (1) is true, so Har is not the oldest and his height is neither the shortest (12) nor the tallest (16); therefore Har’s height is 14 or 15 and his age ≠ 140.  
3. Statements (2), (3) and (6) give the following true relations:

   Heights: Winn > Edvo > Frer and Edvo > (height of the 110-yr person) > Tolo, with Frer > Tolo.  
   Ages: Frer > Edvo > Winn and Tolo > Har (while Tolo is not 130) and (the 110-yr person) is 4th oldest.

4. Statements (3) and (5) contradict each other about the relative ages of Har and Tolo; hence one of them must be the single false statement.  
   Trying “(3) false” leads to an impossible height arrangement, so (3) must be true and (5) is the one false statement.

5. With (3) true, Har is younger than Tolo; therefore Har’s height cannot exceed Winn’s (otherwise statement (5) would be wholly true).  
   Working through the height inequalities, the only viable ordering of the five distinct heights is

        Winn 16  >  Edvo 15  >  Frer 13  >  Har 14  >  Tolo 12  (but 13 is fixed for the oldest)

   This places Frer at 13 hands, making him the 140-yr oldest.  
   The 110-yr person must then have height 14 hands, so Har is the 110-yr man.  
   Since Edvo is older than Winn but younger than Frer, Edvo must be 130 yr and Winn 100 yr, leaving 120 yr for Tolo (and satisfying “Tolo not second-oldest” because second-oldest is 130).

6. All true statements are now satisfied while statement (5) is partly violated (Har is not taller than Winn and not older than Tolo), so it is indeed the single false statement.

Final answer:  
Har – 14 hands, 110 years  
Winn – 16 hands, 100 years  
Edvo – 15 hands, 130 years

For example, if you tell everybody to guess, you can guarantee zero survivors because you have a slight chance of getting zero survivors.",You can guarantee a lot less than you think...,"Let us call the two possible colours B (black) and W (white) and label the 500 prisoners  
P1 , … , P500.

1.  A strategy that guarantees 250 survivors  

   • Before the hats are put on, divide the 500 prisoners into 250 ordered pairs  
     (P1 ,P2), (P3 ,P4), … , (P499 ,P500).  
   • In every pair agree that
         – the first prisoner of the pair (the “copier”) will shout the colour he sees on his
           partner’s head;  
         – the second prisoner of the pair (the “opposite-copier”) will shout the opposite
           colour of what he sees on his partner’s head.

   Check one pair, say (A,B).  There are four possible colourings for their hats:

            A-hat   B-hat   A’s shout (copies)   B’s shout (opposite)   correct shouts
            ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
             B       B            B                   W                  A
             B       W            W                   B                  B
             W       B            B                   B                  B
             W       W            W                   B                  A

   In every row at least one of the two shouts is correct.  
   Because each of the 250 pairs behaves independently, every pair
   contributes at least one correct guess, so at least 250 prisoners are
   guaranteed to survive.

2.  Why 250 is the best possible

   Consider all 2^500 possible assignments of black/white hats, each chosen
   with equal probability.  Fix any deterministic strategy (one rule per
   prisoner telling him what to shout after seeing the other 499 hats).

   For a particular prisoner i and for any fixed view of the other 499 hats,
   there are exactly two possible complete assignments consistent with that
   view: one in which i’s own hat is B and one in which it is W.  
   The prisoner’s rule can match at most one of those two possibilities, so
   – conditional on his view – his chance of being correct is 1/2.  
   Hence, over the uniform distribution of all assignments, the expected
   number of correct guesses is (1/2)·500 = 250.

   If a strategy could guarantee more than 250 correct guesses in every
   assignment, then the expected number of correct guesses would have to be
   greater than 250, contradicting the calculation above.  
   Therefore no strategy can guarantee more than 250 survivors.

Consequently the copier/opposite-copier strategy is optimal.

Standing up, he walks out the door into the middle of the deck and announces ""we have made it this far, but next we need to find both shipwrecks in the right order to point us the right way, towards the island"", followed by tons of ""ehs"".
There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.
With what Captain John knows about the sea, can you figure out where the nine things in a 3-by-3 grid(Wasp, sunken ship 1, sunken ship 2, 2 oceans, 3 reefs, and the island) and go in the right path to the first sunken ship, the second, then the island, without passing over a reef.
The ship can move 1 space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and it can only pass each space once.
1. The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships.
2. There are at least two reefs to the right of sunken ship 2, but the ship isn't in the same row as either of the reefs.
3. One of the oceans is diagonal to only two reefs.
4. The columns and rows of the Wasp and island together take up every single space except the 2nd row of the 3rd column.
5. The island is between two reefs.

   • Pick (1,1) for the Wasp and (3,2) for the Island; their row/column union indeed fills every square except (2,3).  
   → Creative  

2. Apply clue 1 (“The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships”) within that cross.

3. Use clue 2 (“At least two reefs to the right of S₂, but S₂ isn’t in the same row as either reef”) plus clue 6 (one reef above the other two).  
   • Place reefs at (2,3) and (3,3) – both right of S₂ and not in row 1.  
   • Place the third reef in column 1, row 3, i.e. (3,1), satisfying “one reef above the other two.”

80,"You are blindfolded before a table. On the table are a very large number of pennies. You are told 128 of the pennies are heads up and the rest are tails up. How can you create two subgroups of pennies, each with the same number of heads facing up, while remaining blindfolded?",You can flip some subgroup of the pennies!,"Reasoning step-by-step  
1. You cannot see which individual pennies are heads, but you do know the total number of heads: exactly 128.  
2. While blindfolded, select any 128 pennies at random from the table; call this collection Group A. Put every other penny into Group B.  
   • Because you chose purely by position, Group A might contain h heads (0 ≤ h ≤ 128).  
   • Then Group B contains the remaining heads, i.e. 128 − h heads.  
3. Still blindfolded, flip every coin in Group A over once.  

Why this works  
• Before flipping, Group A had h heads and (128 − h) tails.  
• Flipping turns each of those h heads into tails and turns each of the (128 − h) tails into heads.  
• After flipping, Group A now has (128 − h) heads.  
• Group B was never touched, so it still has (128 − h) heads as well.

81,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Reasoning step-by-step

1.  Let Manny’s, Moe’s and Jack’s numbers be m, t and j.
    Public information: m+t+j = 14, all are positive integers.

2.  Manny says “I know Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.”
    Manny sees m.  
    The only way he can be SURE the remaining two numbers are different is if
          14 − m is odd,  
    because an odd number cannot be split into two equal positive integers.  
    Therefore m is odd.

3.  Moe now knows m is odd.  
    He says “In that case, I know that all three of our numbers are different.”
    Moe sees t.  
    For him to be certain his own number is different from Manny’s,
          t must be even                     (since Manny’s is odd).  
    Could Jack share Moe’s even number?  
    If j = t, then m = 14 − 2t, which would be even, contradicting m odd.  
    So with t even Moe can indeed be certain all three numbers are different.
    Conclusion: t is even.

4.  Hence the parities are
          m odd,  t even,  j odd,   all different,   m+t+j = 14.

5.  List all triples satisfying those conditions:

          (m,t,j) = (1,10,3) (1,8,5) (1,6,7) (1,4,9) (1,2,11)
                     (3,10,1) (3,6,5) (3,4,7) (3,2,9)
                     (5,8,1) (5,6,3) (5,2,7)
                     (7,6,1) (7,4,3) (7,2,5)
                     (9,4,1) (9,2,3)
                     (11,2,1)

6.  Jack now says “Now I know all of our numbers.”
    Jack knows j, and from the conversation he knows the list above.
    For him to be able to determine m and t uniquely, his own value j must
    appear in only one triple of the list.

    Counting appearances of each possible j:
        j = 1  … 5 triples
        j = 3  … 4 triples
        j = 5  … 3 triples
        j = 7  … 3 triples
        j = 9  … 2 triples
        j = 11 … 1 triple

    Therefore Jack must be holding 11, and the unique corresponding triple is
          (m,t,j) = (1,2,11).

7.  Gretchen hears everything.  She knows the same list and that Jack could
    deduce the numbers; hence she too narrows it down to the sole possible
    triple (1,2,11).

83,"There is a ten-digit mystery number, represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) A * F = CE

1.  From D × G = BH, the two-digit product BH must have tens digit B, ones digit H, and be attainable by multiplying two distinct digits (2–9).  
   Enumerating such products and requiring B*H to be two-digit eliminates every case with B = 0 or 1.  
   The viable (B,H) pairs together with D,G and the product B × H = JI are

2.  Equation G × I = CF must give a two-digit result whose tens digit C is new and whose ones digit equals F (also a factor in A × F = CE).  
3.  Working case-by-case and enforcing uniqueness of digits quickly eliminates every pair except (B,H) = (7,2):

   •  B = 7, H = 2  
   •  BH = 72, so D × G = 8 × 9 (D = 8, G = 9).  
   •  B × H = 7 × 2 = 14 ⇒ J = 1, I = 4.  
   •  G × I = 9 × 4 = 36 ⇒ C = 3, F = 6.  
   •  Digits used so far: {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}.  Remaining digits: {0,5}.  

4.  Finally, A × F = CE means A × 6 = 3E.  
   With digits 0 and 5 left, 6×5 = 30 fits: C = 3, E = 0, A = 5.  
   All ten digits 0–9 are now used exactly once.

5.  Check all equations:

   D × G = 8 × 9 = 72 = BH ✔

3. Test each (B,H) pair from the table against the uniqueness of all digits and the G × I = CF condition; every pair fails except (B,H) = (7, 2).  From this single surviving case deduce D = 8, G = 9, J = 1, I = 4, C = 3, F = 6, leaving the unused digits {0, 5}. (Rudimentary)

84,"In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?",,"Stu Pidfule actually did leave exactly the same sum to each of his children.  
After they received their inheritances they treated the money differently:  

• Derek put his share into good investments and watched it grow.  
• Eric squandered his share on wild living and soon had very little left.  
• Monkeyboy bought useless “magic” beans and ended up with nothing at all.  

So in the end the three children wound up with different amounts of money, but that difference was the result of what each of them chose to do after the inheritance was received, not of any unequal treatment in the will itself.

85,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
Note: a leading zero (0) can be used in the following equations.
1) CD * 3 = AJ
2) GH * 2 = JA
3) D * H = BE
4) B * H = FI","A) Calculate the possible equations for CD * 3 = AJ.  Eliminate any equation whose product has two digits that are the same.  Eliminate any equation whose product shares a common digit with the multiplicand.
","We need a 10-digit pandigital number ABCDEFGHIJ (no leading zero) that satisfies  

1) CD × 3 = AJ  
2) GH × 2 = JA  
3) D × H = BE  
4) B × H = FI  

(Leading zeros are allowed within the two–digit products.)

Step 1 – analyse the pair (A,J)

JA = 10J + A is twice something, so it must be even ⇒ A is even.  
AJ = 10A + J is three times something, so 10A + J ≡ 0 (mod 3) ⇒ A + J ≡ 0 (mod 3).

With A ∈ {2,4,6,8} the (A,J) pairs that satisfy A+J ≡ 0 (mod 3) are  

(2,4) (2,7)  
(4,2) (4,5) (4,8)  
(6,0) (6,3) (6,9)  
(8,1) (8,4) (8,7)

Step 2 – compute JA = 10J + A and GH = JA/2

Discard any pair whose JA/2 is not a two-digit number when a leading zero is allowed.

The viable triplets (A,J; GH) are

(2,4; 21) (2,7; 36)  
(4,2; 12) (4,5; 27) (4,8; 42)  
(6,0; 03) (6,3; 18) (6,9; 48)  
(8,1; 09) (8,4; 24) (8,7; 39)

Step 3 – compute AJ = 10A + J and CD = AJ/3

Check each case for distinct digits and proceed to equations (3) and (4).  
All but one fail because of repeated digits or because BE or FI is not two-digit.

The single surviving case is

A = 8 J = 1 ⇒ JA = 18, AJ = 81  
GH = 09 ⇒ G = 0, H = 9  
CD = 27 ⇒ C = 2, D = 7

Step 4 – use equations (3) and (4)

D·H = 7·9 = 63 ⇒ B = 6, E = 3  
B·H = 6·9 = 54 ⇒ F = 5, I = 4

Digits obtained: 8 6 2 7 3 5 0 9 4 1 — every digit 0–9 appears exactly once.

86,"The five-person city council of Noyes Heights met recently to vote on five proposals. Each of the five council members cast an aye or a nay vote for each of the five proposals, with no abstentions. Use the clues below to discover how each council member voted on each of the proposals.
1. Each proposal got a different number of aye votes (possibly zero).
2. All in all, there was one more aye vote than nay vote cast.
3. At no time did Quincy vote nay on two consecutive proposals.
4. Orlando, Penny and Sven voted the same way on the second proposal.
5. Rosina voted aye on the fourth proposal.
6. Quincy and Sven voted differently from each other on each of the first three proposals.
7. The third proposal received one more aye vote than the second proposal did.",Write down all your steps and be sure to check that each logical deduction follows with 100% certainty from the information you have,"The only pattern of aye–totals per proposal that satisfies clues 1 & 2 is  
0, 1, 3, 4, 5 (in some order), because the five different totals must sum to 13.

Clue 7 says Proposal 3 has one more aye than Proposal 2, so the (P2, P3) pair must be one of (0,1), (3,4) or (4,5).  
• (0,1) is impossible, for with 0 ayes everyone would vote nay, contradicting clue 6 (Quincy and Sven differ on P2).  
• Taking (4,5) makes P2 = 4 ayes, but then O, P, S would all have to vote alike (clue 4) giving at least 4 identical votes; that would force Quincy to match Sven somewhere among the first three proposals, contradicting clue 6.  
• Therefore (P2, P3) = (3, 4).

With 3 ayes on P2 and O, P, S voting alike (clue 4), they must be the 3 ayes and Quincy & Rosina the nays.  
Thus on P2:  Q N, O A, P A, S A, R N.

Because Quincy has just cast a nay, clue 3 forbids him from also voting nay on the next proposal, so on P3 Quincy votes Aye.  
Since Quincy and Sven must differ on P3 (clue 6), Sven votes Nay.  
P3 needs 4 ayes, so O, P, R join Quincy in voting Aye.

So far:

    P1 P2 P3  
Quincy  ?  N  A  
Orlando  ?  A  A  
Penny    ?  A  A  
Sven     ?  A  N  
Rosina   ?  N  A  

The remaining aye–totals 0, 1, 5 go to P1, P4, P5.  
P4 cannot be 0 (Rosina must vote Aye there—clue 5).  
P1 cannot be 0 either, because Quincy must vote Aye on P1 (otherwise he would have two consecutive nays with P2, violating clue 3).  
Hence P5 is the 0-aye proposal (everyone votes Nay).

That leaves totals 1 and 5 for P1 and P4.  
P1 cannot have 5 ayes, because we already know Sven must differ from Quincy on P1 (clue 6), so P1 must have exactly 1 aye—Quincy’s.  
Consequently P4 is unanimous with 5 ayes.

The complete voting record is therefore:

               P1 P2 P3 P4 P5  
Quincy   A  N  A  A  N  
Orlando  N  A  A  A  N  
Penny   N  A  A  A  N  
Sven    N  A  N  A  N  
Rosina   N  N  A  A  N  

All clues are satisfied: each proposal received 1, 3, 4, 5, 0 distinct ayes (summing to 13), Quincy never had two consecutive nays, P2 votes of O, P, S are identical, Quincy and Sven differ on each of the first three proposals, Proposal 3 has one more aye than Proposal 2, and Rosina voted aye on Proposal 4.

87,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","Reasoning, step by step

A.  Formalising the situation
• Two players:  the dog (D) and the flower (F).  
• F has a costly action P (“produce poison”) or ¬P (“do not produce poison”).  
  – Producing poison keeps F alive whatever D later does, but costs it an effort-cost c>0.  
  – Not producing poison costs nothing, but if D subsequently eats the flower, F dies.  
• After F’s (unobservable) choice, D chooses Eat or ¬Eat.  
  – If D eats and the flower is un-poisoned, D surely recovers (pay-off 1).  
  – If D eats and the flower is poisoned, D surely dies (pay-off 0).  
  – If D does not eat it lives with probability ½ (expected pay-off 0.5).  
• Common knowledge: both players are perfectly rational and everything in the list
  1–15 of the statement is common knowledge.

B.  The flower’s best-response rule
Given any positive probability q that the dog might eat,
  – Expected survival if F does NOT poison: 1–q  
  – Expected survival if F DOES poison: 1–c  
Hence F prefers to poison whenever q>c.  Because c is merely “some effort”, F will poison
as soon as it is not absolutely certain (q=0) that the dog will refrain from eating.

C.  Can the flower be absolutely certain that the dog will not eat?
No.  There is no communication, no visible commitment, no physical impossibility that
prevents the dog from choosing Eat.  All F can do is reason about D’s rationality, but
pure reasoning cannot give a probability q=0; “the dog must not want to eat” is not a
logical necessity, merely a strategic consideration.  Hence from F’s point of view
q>0, so F’s rational move is to produce poison.

D.  The dog’s best response to that knowledge
The dog knows every item above, in particular:
  – It knows the flower will reason exactly as in B and therefore will in fact poison.
Therefore the dog evaluates its options:
  • Eat → death with certainty (pay-off 0).  
  • Do not eat → survival probability ½ (pay-off 0.5).  
Since 0.5 > 0, a rational dog chooses ¬Eat.

E.  Consistency (equilibrium check)
Given D’s choice ¬Eat, F is still happy with its decision to poison: producing the
poison costs c but guarantees survival (1–c), while skipping the poison would expose
it to the still-positive risk that D might deviate and eat (yield 1–q with q>0).  Hence
poisoning remains its best move.  The strategy pair
  (F: P, D: ¬Eat)
is therefore a Nash equilibrium.

Conclusion
Because the flower will rationally manufacture poison (to eliminate even the slightest
chance of being eaten), the dog realises that eating would be fatal and therefore opts
not to eat.

89,"Little Mad Ade, son of Mad Ade, leaves home in the morning to go to school. As he leaves the house he looks at the clock in the mirror. The clock has no number indication and for this reason the boy makes a mistake in interpreting the time (mirror-image). Just assuming the clock must be out of order, the Little Mad Ade cycles to school, where he arrives after twenty minutes. At that moment, the clock at school shows a time that is two and a half hours later than the time that Little Mad Ade saw on the clock at home.
At what time did he reach school?",Think about the difference between the real time and the time of a mirror image. ,"Let  

t  = the real time (in minutes after 12:00) that the boy actually saw at home,  
t′ = the time he THINKS he sees in the mirror.

1. Relation between a time and its mirror image  
For an ordinary 12-hour dial, the image you see in a mirror is the “complement to 12 : 00”:
 t′ = 12 : 00 − t.  
(In minutes: t′ = 720 − t.)

2. Relation imposed by the statement  
He rides 20 min to school, and when he arrives the school clock reads
 (t + 20 min).  
This reading is said to be 2 h 30 min later than what he saw at home, i.e.
 t + 20 = t′ + 150.

3. Solve the simultaneous equations  

t + 20 = (720 − t) + 150  
t + 20 = 870 − t  
2t = 850  
t = 425 min.

4. Convert 425 min to hours  
425 ÷ 60 = 7 h  remainder 5 min → 7 : 05.

So the correct time when he left home was 7 : 05.  
He rode 20 minutes, therefore he arrived at

7 : 05 + 0 : 20 = 7 : 25.

A quick check: the mirror reading at home would have been 12 : 00 − 7 : 05 = 4 : 55;  
adding 2 h 30 min gives 7 : 25, exactly what the school clock shows.

90,"One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?",Think about the letters in each name. ,"Step-1:  List every person.

• KINGS :  James, Saul, Henry  
• QUEENS :  Victoria, Elizabeth, Candace  
• RELIGIOUS FIGURES :  Pope, Mother Teresa, Gandhi  
• STOOGES :  Moe, Larry, Curly  

Step-2:  Record every shoulder-tap exactly as it is described.

A.  STOOGES  
   – Moe → (James, Gandhi, Pope, Saul) two taps each  
   – Larry → (Henry, Curly) one tap each  
   – Curly → (Henry, Larry) one tap each  

B.  KINGS  
   – James → (Pope, Saul, Gandhi, Moe) two taps each  
   – Saul  → (Gandhi, Moe, James, Pope) two taps each  
   – Henry → (Larry, Curly) one tap each  

C.  QUEENS  
   – Elizabeth ↔ Victoria (they tap one another four times each)  

Step-3:  Tally the TOTAL number of times every individual is tapped.

Moe .......... 4  
Larry ........ 2  
Curly ........ 2  
James ........ 4  
Saul ......... 4  
Henry ........ 2

93,"There's a certain 10-digit number where that the first digit is equal to the number of zeros in the entire number, the second number is the number of 1's in the entire number, the third number is the number of 2's in the entire number, and so on, to where the 10th digit is the number of 9's in the entire number.
What is the number?",The first digit must be pretty large-- there are many zeros. Work from there ,"Let the ten digits be  

d₀ d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉ ,

where dᵢ is the number of i’s appearing in the whole number.

1.  The ten digits themselves form a multiset of size 10.  
    If exactly k of the digits are non–zero, then the remaining 10 − k digits are 0’s, so  
    d₀ = 10 − k.

2.  Try k = 4 (i.e. four non-zero digits).  
    Then d₀ = 10 − 4 = 6.  
    So the four non-zero positions must be positions 0, 1, 2 and one other (call it p).

3.  Because the sum of all digits must be 10, we need  

        d₀ + d₁ + d₂ + d_p = 10
        6  + d₁ + d₂ + d_p = 10  ⇒  d₁ + d₂ + d_p = 4.

    The only positive integers that add to 4 and will serve as three digits are 2, 1, 1
    (in some order).  
    Thus, among the digits there will be two 1’s and one 2.

4.  Two 1’s means d₁ must equal 2, so position 1 is 2:

        d₁ = 2.

    One 2 means d₂ must equal 1, so position 2 is 1:

        d₂ = 1.

5.  We still need another 1.  Put it at position 6:

        d₆ = 1.

6.  Now list the digits obtained:

        position : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        digit    : 6 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

    Check the counts:

        • 0’s : positions 3,4,5,7,8,9  → 6 zeros  → d₀ = 6 ✔
        • 1’s : positions 2,6          → 2 ones   → d₁ = 2 ✔
        • 2’s : position 1             → 1 two    → d₂ = 1 ✔
        • 3’s : none                   → d₃ = 0 ✔
        • 4’s : none                   → d₄ = 0 ✔
        • 5’s : none                   → d₅ = 0 ✔
        • 6’s : position 0             → 1 six    → d₆ = 1 ✔
        • 7’s, 8’s, 9’s : none         → d₇ = d₈ = d₉ = 0 ✔

    Every requirement is satisfied.

There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.","1.  “I know Crackle and Pop are different.”  
   Snap sees his own number x.  
   If Crackle and Pop could be equal, the unknown remainder 14 – x would have to be even (it could be split equally).  
   Since Snap is certain they are different, 14 – x must be odd  ⇒  x is odd.

2.  “I already knew all three of our numbers were different.”  
   Crackle sees his own number y.  Before Snap spoke he could already rule out every possibility in which any two numbers are equal.

   • Snap = Pop would give 2a + y = 14 ⇒ y is even – so y must be odd.  
   • Snap = Crackle would give 2y + z = 14 ⇒ y ≤ 6 – so y ≥ 7.  
   • Crackle = Pop gives the same bound y ≤ 6 – again y ≥ 7.

   Therefore y is an odd integer ≥ 7, so y ∈ {7, 9, 11}.

3.  Pop now knows every statement above and sees his own number z.  
   He also knows the total is 14, Snap’s number is odd, and Crackle’s number is 7, 9 or 11.

   Write 14 = x + y + z with x odd and y ∈ {7, 9, 11}.  
   For each possible y we solve for the needed x + z:

        y = 7  ⇒  x + z = 7
        y = 9  ⇒  x + z = 5
        y = 11 ⇒  x + z = 3

   Pop now substitutes the value he actually sees for z:

        If z = 6  ⇒  x + z = 7 gives x = 1 and forces y = 7 – unique solution.
        If z = 4  ⇒  x + z could be 7 or 5 (two possibilities) – not unique.
        If z = 2  ⇒  three different possibilities remain – not unique.

   Because Pop can announce the answer, he must be holding 6, so the only consistent triple is  
        Snap  = 1,   Crackle = 7,   Pop = 6.

4.  Everyone in the class has heard exactly the same public reasoning.  Gretchen simply follows the logical chain above, so she too can state the numbers.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Snap reasons that if Crackle and Pop could have been equal, then the unknown remainder 14 – x would have to be even; because he can rule that out, he concludes 14 – x is odd and therefore his own number x is odd.  

2. (Creative)  Crackle examines the hypothetical case Snap = Pop (2a + y = 14).  Seeing that would force y to be even, he infers his own number y cannot be even, hence y is odd.  

3. (Creative)  Crackle next considers the cases Snap = Crackle or Crackle = Pop (2y + z = 14).  Both would require y ≤ 6; because he already knows all three numbers are different, he deduces y must in fact be ≥ 7.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Combining “y is odd” with “y ≥ 7,” Crackle narrows his possible value to the set {7, 9, 11}.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Pop knows x is odd, y ∈ {7, 9, 11}, and x + y + z = 14, so he lists the three required totals for x + z: 7, 5, 3 corresponding to y = 7, 9, 11.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Substituting his own visible value of z, Pop checks which total leaves a single consistent solution: z = 6 yields x = 1 and y = 7 (unique); z = 4 or 2 leave multiple possibilities.  Hence the only viable triple is (Snap, Crackle, Pop) = (1, 7, 6).

98,"In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room....","Give the machines inside provisional names (M1 … M4).  
While still in the room the brother does nothing to their own switches – he just
walks out and begins to play with the four back-up switches in the corridor.
All the information he needs will be coded into how long each machine is
supplied with current.

Outside he does the following.

1. Puts every back-up switch to OFF and waits long enough for every motor to
   stop and cool right down.

2. Turns back-up switch A ON and lets it run for about ten minutes, then puts
   it OFF again.  (The motor that belongs to A will become very hot.)

3. Immediately turns back-up switch B ON, lets it run for about five minutes,
   then turns it OFF.  (That motor will be warm, but not as hot as the first.)

4. Immediately turns back-up switch C ON and lets it run for only one minute,
   then turns it OFF.  (That motor will be only slightly warm.)

5. Finally turns back-up switch D ON and leaves it ON.

Now he re-enters the saw room.

• Exactly one machine is still running – the one whose motor is getting its
  current from the switch that was left ON.  That machine therefore belongs to
  back-up switch D.

• Of the three silent machines he simply feels the casings:

    – the very hot one belongs to switch A (ten-minute run);

    – the plainly warm one belongs to switch B (five-minute run);

    – the almost-cool one belongs to switch C (one-minute run).

Thus, with a single trip out of the room and a single return, he can match
every outside back-up switch to its own machine inside, using nothing except
the switches themselves.

99,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","Reasoning summary  
•  To make the back face end up Dark-Blue (Blue + Black) the blue coat has to be on the back before the black coat is applied, because once black is put on a face it can no longer be changed (rule 3).  
  ⇒  Blue precedes Black.  

•  To make the front-face circle Gray (White + Black) the white circle must already be there when the black paint is applied.  
  ⇒  White precedes Black.  

•  To keep the front background pure Black (not Maroon = Red + Black) the red coat must be applied only after the black coat is fixed.  
  ⇒  Black precedes Red.  

So the partial order we must satisfy is  
 White , Blue    ≺   Black   ≺   Red.

Of the two colors that must precede Black, White must come before Blue if we are to satisfy the logical condition that “exactly one” of the four given claims is true:

Checking the order White → Blue → Black → Red (b → d → c → a):

Claim 1: “Black was added first”  false  
Claim 2: “Red was added before blue”  false  
Claim 3: “Blue was added after white”  true  
Claim 4: “White was added last”  false  

Exactly one claim (the third) is true, as required.  
The coloring obtained with this order matches every detail of the final cube description:

• Top: Blue then Red → Purple.  
• Back: Blue then Black → Dark-Blue.  
• Front: White circle then Black → Gray circle on Black background; later Red does nothing.  
• Bottom: White circle, Blue (makes Light-Blue circle), then Red (Blue+Red=Purple background).  
• Left & Right: White circle, later Red (Pink circle on Red background).  

All faces therefore have the stated final colors.

Steps:  
1. Note that, because black paint “freezes” a face (Rule 3), the back face can only become Dark-Blue if blue is already there when black is applied; therefore Blue must be applied before Black. (Creative)  

2. Observe that the front‐face circle ends as Gray (White + Black).  That can only happen if the white circle is in place before the black coat; hence White must be applied before Black. (Creative)  

3. To keep the front background pure Black (and not Maroon = Red + Black), red must come only after the black layer is fixed; therefore Black must precede Red. (Creative)  

4. Combine the three precedences to obtain the partial order:  White, Blue  ≺  Black  ≺  Red. (Rudimentary)  

5. Use the “exactly one of the four claims is true” condition to decide the relative order of White and Blue.

100,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"Step 1 – translate the troll’s rule into mathematics  
For every one of the 13 given pairs exactly one letter is in the password (call it “P-letter”) and the other is not (call it “O-letter”).  
If we list the 13 O-letters in ordinary alphabetical order and write, under each of them, its partner P-letter, the row of P-letters we obtain – read from left to right – is the password.

Step 2 – use the five short words  
Let pᵢ (i = 1 … 13) be 0 when the left–hand letter of pair i is the P-letter and 1 when the right-hand letter is the P-letter.  
Counting, for every short word, how many of its letters are in the password gives

FACE   : 4 – (p₁ + p₃ + p₅ + p₆)  
QUEST  : 2 + p₃ + p₆ – p₅  
QUICK  : 2 + p₆ + p₅ – p₉  
SWITCH : 4 + p₂ – p₃ – p₈ – p₉  
WORLD  : 2 + p₂ + p₉ + p₁₀ – p₁₁ – p₄

The troll says each of the five numbers above is the same.  Equating them and solving the resulting system of linear equations in the 0/1 variables gives one consistent solution:

p₁ = 0 p₂ = 0 p₃ = 0 p₄ = 0 p₅ = 0  
p₆ = 1 p₇ = 1 p₈ = 1 p₉ = 0 p₁₀ = 1  
p₁₁ = 0 p₁₂ = 1 p₁₃ = 0

(Every short word then shares exactly three letters with the password.)

Step 3 – identify P-letters and O-letters

pair 1  A–V : A in password, V other  
pair 2  B–W : B in password, W other  
pair 3  C–Q : C in password, Q other  
pair 4  D–M : D in password, M other  
pair 5  E–K : E in password, K other  
pair 6  F–U : U in password, F other  
pair 7  G–N : N in password, G other  
pair 8  H–P : P in password, H other  
pair 9  I–O : I in password, O other  
pair10  J–R : R in password, J other  
pair11  L–X : L in password, X other  
pair12  S–T : T in password, S other  
pair13  Y–Z : Y in password, Z other  

O-letters:  F G H J K M O Q S V W X Z  
(sorted)  :  F  G  H  J  K  M  O  Q  S  V  W  X  Z  
P-letters under them:  
             U  N  P  R  E  D  I  C  T  A  B  L  Y

Step 4 – read the password

2. (Creative) From clue 2 recognise that exactly three new teams – Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons – are respectively matched with (i) the fullback, (ii) the player whose former team is Downers, and (iii) Cowan (order still unknown).  

3. (Creative) From clue 3 recognise a parallel triple: the former teams Downers, Scarlets and Jets are respectively matched with (i) Tuitupou, (ii) the centre, and (iii) the player who will sign with Typhoons (order unknown).  

4. (Creative) Intersect the results of Steps 2 and 3: the “player from Downers” and the “player who signs with Typhoons” must be the same person, so Typhoons signs the man who used to play for Downers.  

5. (Creative) Use clue 4 (Jeeper and the centre sign with Downers and Typhoons in some order).  
   • Because Typhoons definitely signs the ex-Downer (Step 4), Jeeper must be the Typhoons signee and the centre must be the Downers signee.  

6. (Rudimentary) Apply clue 7 (“The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker”).  
   • Jeeper is the only player whose former team is now known to be Downers, so Jeeper is the hooker.  

7. (Rudimentary) Typhoons is now fixed (Jeeper/hooker/from Downers). Therefore Mountaineers and Troopers are the two remaining new teams still to be paired with Cowan and the fullback (from Step 2).  

8. (Creative) Combine clues 5, 6 & 8.  
   • Clue 5: Rokocoko and McGuyver left Mountaineers and Troopers (order unknown).  
   • Clue 6: Whoever left Troopers signed with Jets.  
   • Clue 8: Rokocoko is not the fullback.  
   Analyse the two cases (Rokocoko vs McGuyver leaving Troopers) and see only one fits all constraints.  

9. (Creative) Resolve the analysis:  
   • McGuyver is the fullback; he left Mountaineers and signed with Troopers.  
   • Rokocoko left Troopers and therefore (clue 6) signed with Jets; he is not the fullback.  
   • Cowan therefore must be the player who signed with Mountaineers.  

10. (Creative) Use clue 9 (“The wing … signed with the Scarlets”) plus clue 10 (“Grippley didn’t sign Scarlets”).  
    Only Scarlets remains unassigned among new teams, so the wing is Tuitupou and he signs with Scarlets.  

11. (Creative) Re-examine the triple of former teams from Step 3.  
    • Downers already lost Jeeper (Typhoons signee).  
    • Scarlets now cannot have lost Tuitupou (he has just joined them), so Scarlets must have lost the centre.  
    • Therefore Jets lost Tuitupou.  
    Hence the centre’s former team is Scarlets.  

12. (Rudimentary) With “centre” now tied to “former Scarlets” and “new Downers”, the only player that still fits is Grippley.  
    Assign: Grippley – centre – new Downers – former Scarlets.  

13. (Rudimentary) The only unassigned positions are prop and fly-half.  
    • Clue 11 says the fly-half is not Cowan and is not going to Mountaineers.  
    • Rokocoko (new Jets) fits those conditions, so Rokocoko is the fly-half.  
    • Cowan therefore is the prop.

For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else.","Step 1 – List the people with their “extra roles”.
Directors (5)  
• Holly Wood  (needs nothing special)  
• Jed I. Knight  
• Ty Tanick (Actor)  
• Winnie DePooh (Singer)  
• Zoltan Pepper  

Musicians (4)  
• Howard Eyeno (Actor)  
• Eve O'Looshun (Actor)  
• Di O'Bolic  
• Brighton Early (Singer)

Step 2 – Translate the restrictions.
1. Group must be 2 Directors + 2 Musicians.
2. At least one Actor  {Ty, Howard, Eve} must be present.
3. At least one Singer {Winnie, Brighton} must be present.
4. If Howard is in, Holly must also be in and Ty must not be in.
5. Winnie refuses to be with Eve.             (W & E not together)

103,"One variation of the famous ""Eight Queens Puzzle"" is the ""Bishop Puzzle"".
We know that you can place up to 8 queens on a chessboard with no other pieces in such a fashion that no queen can be taken.  We also know that you can place 32 knights on the board in such a fashion that none can be taken.
Do you know how many bishops you can place on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no piece can be taken?  What is their placement?",Take advantage of the fact that bishops can't move like rooks!,"Reasoning  

1.  A bishop always remains on the colour of the square on which it starts, so the problem splits into two
   independent sub-problems – one on the dark squares and one on the light squares.  
   (A bishop on a dark square can never meet a bishop on a light square.)

2.  Look only at the dark squares.  
   On an 8 × 8 board there are exactly seven N-S diagonals of dark squares and seven E-W diagonals of dark
   squares (count them or notice that the diagonal index
   r-c is even and can take the seven even values −6,−4,−2,0,2,4,6).
   If two bishops are put on the same diagonal of either
   orientation they attack each other, so on the dark squares you can put at most one bishop on each of
   those seven diagonals; hence

           at most 7 dark-square bishops.

   The identical argument gives the same bound for the light squares, so altogether

           maximum number of non-attacking bishops ≤ 7 + 7 = 14.

   (A 15th bishop would force one colour to contain eight bishops, which is impossible because that colour
   has only seven diagonals of one direction.)

3.  It remains to show that 14 bishops can really be placed.
   The following diagram (ranks 1 at the bottom, 8 at the top, files a–h from left to right) does the job;
   “B” marks a bishop, “·” an empty square.

   Algebraic notation of the bishops:  

        Dark squares : a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8  
        Light squares: b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8  

   Check:  
   – On the dark squares the seven bishops have r-c values  
     0, −2, −4, −6, 6, 4, 2  (all different) and r+c values  
     2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14  (all different), so none attack.  
   – On the light squares the seven bishops have r-c values  
     −1, −3, −5, −7, 5, 3, 1  and r+c values  
     3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15  (all different), so none attack.  
   – Bishops on opposite colours cannot meet.

Since we have 14 bishops and no pair attacks, and 14 is the theoretical upper bound, this arrangement is optimal.

104,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"Let the four weights have whole-number values  

             w₁ ≤ w₂ ≤ w₃ ≤ w₄.

Because the assessor uses a balance scale, a weight can be

  • placed on the same pan as the gold dust (counted with a “–” sign),  
  • placed on the opposite pan (counted with a “+” sign), or  
  • not used at all (counted with “0”).

Thus every weighing corresponds to an expression

             ±w₁ ± w₂ ± w₃ ± w₄,

and with four weights there are 3⁴ = 81 different sign-choices.  
Interchanging the two pans merely changes the overall sign, so at most half of
those (aside from the “all zeros” case) give distinct positive masses:

             maximum possible consecutive range = (3⁴ – 1)/2 = 40.

The question is whether one can actually achieve every integer mass 1,2,…,40
with four appropriately chosen weights.  The classic way is to let each weight
be three times the preceding one:

             w₁ = 1    (needed to weigh 1 oz)  
             w₂ = 3    (then 1,2,3,4 can be formed)  
             w₃ = 9    (extends the attainable range to 1–13)  
             w₄ = 27   (extends the range to 1–40).

Indeed, any integer n with |n| ≤ 40 possesses a balanced-ternary expansion
n = a₁·1 + a₂·3 + a₃·9 + a₄·27 where each coefficient aᵢ is –1, 0, or 1; the
coefficients tell which pan each weight must be placed on.

Therefore, with the four weights 1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz and 27 oz the assessor can
measure every whole number of ounces from 1 up to 40, and 40 is the largest
such number possible with only four weights.

1. (Rudimentary) Introduce notation for the four whole-number weights and order them as w₁ ≤ w₂ ≤ w₃ ≤ w₄.

4. (Creative) Use symmetry: swapping the two pans multiplies every expression by –1, so apart from the all-zero case the 81 expressions come in ± pairs. Hence there can be at most (81 – 1)/2 = 40 distinct positive masses, so no four weights can cover a longer consecutive run than 1–40.

107,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?","If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129","Let the houses be numbered 1–10.  
Call the two houses that get no letters A and B.

1.  Deliveries per week  
•  6 working days × 4 houses per day = 24 deliveries.  
•  8 houses receive mail, each exactly 3 times (because 8 × 3 = 24).

2.  Using the given daily sums  
   Monday   18  
   Tuesday  12  
   Wednesday 23  
   Thursday 19  
   Friday   32  
   Saturday 25  
   Total for the week = 18+12+23+19+32+25 = 129.

   This 129 is the sum of the house-numbers of the 24 deliveries.  
   Because every used house appears exactly 3 times,

        3 × (sum of the 8 used house numbers) = 129  
        ⇒ sum of the 8 used numbers = 43.

3.  Determining the two unused houses  
   The numbers 1–10 add to 55, so the two unused numbers must sum to
        55 – 43 = 12.

   Possible pairs whose sum is 12 are  
        (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7).

4.  Eliminating impossible pairs  
   Any day’s four numbers must be distinct and must give the required
   daily sum.  In particular, we must reach the largest daily sum, 32.

   • With pair (2,10) omitted, the largest four remaining numbers are
     9+8+7+6 = 30 < 32  → impossible.  
   • With pair (3,9) omitted, largest four are 10+8+7+6 = 31 < 32
     → impossible.  
   • With pair (5,7) omitted, try to obtain 32 from
     {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10}.  No 4 distinct numbers here total 32
     → impossible.  
   • With pair (4,8) omitted, the set {1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10} does contain
     10+9+7+6 = 32  → this pair is feasible.

   Hence the only possible pair of unused houses is (4, 8).

5.  Showing an explicit weekly schedule (one of many)  
   Houses used: 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10 – each exactly 3 times.

         Mon  2 3 6 7   (sum 18)

         Fri 10 9 7 6   (sum 32)  
         Sat 10 9 5 1   (sum 25)

   ones, and every used house appears exactly three times.

HOW TO READ THE RESULT  
After the three weighings write the result as a triple

 ( W₁ , W₂ , W₃ ),

where Wi = 0 if weighing i balances, +1 if the left pan is heavier, –1 if the right pan is heavier.

1. If you obtain (0,0,0) every ball has the correct weight – there is no odd ball.

2. Otherwise find the triple in the table below; the corresponding ball is the odd one.
 If the triple you obtained is in the left column the ball is heavier;  
 if the triple you obtained is in the right column it is lighter (because the signs are reversed).

 (-1  1  0) ( 1 -1  0) → 12
 ( 1  1  1) (-1 -1 -1) → 13

Because there are 27 possible outcome triples (3³), and exactly the 27 situations to distinguish (13 balls heavier, 13 balls lighter, or no odd ball), every situation produces its own unique triple, so the procedure always identifies the odd ball (and whether it is heavy or light) – or confirms that all the balls are normal – using only the three weighings required.

Because  
• all 8 pawns are identical,  
• the 2 rooks are identical to each other,  
• the 2 knights are identical to each other,  
• the 2 bishops are identical to each other,  
• the queen and the king are each unique,  

the problem is one of counting permutations with repetitions.

Method 1 – “multinomial” view  
Total permutations of 16 distinguishable objects = 16!  
Divide by the factorial of each set of identical pieces:

Number of distinct arrangements

Method 2 – “choose the squares” view  
Step-wise choice of squares for each type:

1. Choose 8 of the 16 squares for the pawns: C(16, 8) = 12 870.  
2. From the remaining 8 squares choose 2 for the rooks: C(8, 2) = 28.  
3. From the remaining 6 squares choose 2 for the knights: C(6, 2) = 15.  
4. From the remaining 4 squares choose 2 for the bishops: C(4, 2) = 6.  
5. From the remaining 2 squares choose 1 for the queen: C(2, 1) = 2.  
6. The last square then holds the king.

Multiply:

110,"Heather, her husband, their son, their daughter, and Heather's brother lived together in a house...until yesterday, when one of the five was murdered by one of the other four. Here are some facts that refer only to the five family members:
1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?","From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then suppose Heather was not at the park. Find some contradiction.","Reasoning step–by–step  

1.  “A man and a woman were at the store together.”  
    •  Among the five people the only adult woman is Heather.  
    •  Therefore Heather was the woman at the store.  
    •  The man at the store had to be an adult male; the only possibilities are Heather’s husband or Heather’s brother.  

2.  “Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.”  
    •  Hence Heather’s husband could not have been with her at the store.  
    •  Consequently the man with Heather at the store was Heather’s brother.  

   →  Store: Heather and her brother.

3.  One of Heather’s two children (the son or the daughter) was “at home alone.”  
    •  Thus the only two family members not yet placed (Heather’s husband and the remaining child) must have been the pair who were “at the park together” – i.e. the murderer and the victim.

   →  Park: Heather’s husband and whichever child was not at home.  
   →  Home: the other child.

4.  “The murderer is younger than the victim.”  
    •  Any child is younger than any parent.

1.  If Kiera’s chapter is three chapters after “Freudian Slippers” (clue 3), then  
   Freudian Slippers must be chapter 1 or 2.  
   • Freudian Slippers = 1 ⇒ Kiera = 4.  
   • Freudian Slippers = 2 ⇒ Kiera = 5.

2.  Alex’s chapter is sandwiched between “Sense of Hume-or” and “Descartes Before DesHorse” (clue 1).  
   Therefore Alex cannot have chapter 1 or 5; the three-chapter run must be
        Hume  –  Alex  –  Descartes
   occupying (1,2,3), (2,3,4) or (3,4,5).

3.  Try Freudian Slippers = 1 (Kiera = 4).  
   None of the possible Hume–Alex–Descartes runs fit without contradiction, so this case fails.

4.  Therefore Freudian Slippers = 2 and Kiera = 5.  
   The only Hume–Alex–Descartes arrangement that keeps chapter 2 free for Alex (who would then have Freudian) or keeps chapter 2 as Freudian with Alex elsewhere is:
        chapter 3  =  Sense of Hume-or  
        chapter 4  =  Alex’s chapter  
        chapter 5  =  Descartes Before DesHorse
   So Alex has chapter 4.

5.  The two remaining titles are “Jung At Heart” and “I Kant Understand It”, to be placed in chapters 1 and 4.  

6.  Clue 4: “I Kant Understand It” is consecutive with Joan’s chapter, and Joan’s chapter is not chapter 4.  
   • Put Kant in chapter 4 → Joan must be chapter 3 (adjacent and not chapter 4).  
   This works, so:
        chapter 4  =  I Kant Understand It (Alex)  
        chapter 3  =  Sense of Hume-or (Joan)

7.  Therefore chapter 1 takes the last title, “Jung At Heart”.

8.  Clue 2: “Jung At Heart” must be before Toby’s chapter, so Toby cannot be chapter 1.  
   The only chapters still without students are 1 and 2; hence Toby must be chapter 2, leaving Caleb for chapter 1.

All conditions are now satisfied:

Chapter 1: “Jung At Heart” – Caleb  
Chapter 2: “Freudian Slippers” – Toby  
Chapter 3: “Sense of Hume-or” – Joan  
Chapter 4: “I Kant Understand It” – Alex  
Chapter 5: “Descartes Before DesHorse” – Kiera

Chapter 1 – Jung At Heart – Caleb

Steps:  
1. Apply Clue 3 (“Kiera’s chapter is three chapters after ‘Freudian Slippers’”) to deduce that “Freudian Slippers” can only be in chapter 1 or chapter 2, giving the two immediate possibilities (Freudian = 1 ⇒ Kiera = 4, or Freudian = 2 ⇒ Kiera = 5).  
2. Apply Clue 1 (“Alex’s chapter is between ‘Sense of Hume-or’ and ‘Descartes Before DesHorse’”) to conclude the three titles must appear consecutively in the order Hume – Alex – Descartes, which in turn rules out Alex having chapter 1 or chapter 5 and limits the consecutive triple to positions (1-2-3), (2-3-4), or (3-4-5).  
3. Test the first possibility from Step 1 (Freudian = 1, Kiera = 4) against the consecutive-triple constraints from Step 2 and find that no placement works, so reject this entire case.  
4. Accept the remaining option from Step 1 (Freudian = 2, Kiera = 5) and fit the Hume – Alex – Descartes triple around it; this forces the arrangement chapter 3 = “Sense of Hume-or,” chapter 4 = Alex’s chapter, chapter 5 = “Descartes Before DesHorse,” giving Alex chapter 4.  
5. Note that the only titles still unplaced are “Jung At Heart” and “I Kant Understand It,” which must therefore occupy chapters 1 and 4.  
6. Use Clue 4 (“‘I Kant Understand It’ is consecutive with Joan’s chapter, Joan’s chapter is not chapter 4”) to place “I Kant Understand It” in chapter 4 (Alex) and, being consecutive and not in chapter 4, assign Joan to chapter 3 (which already holds “Sense of Hume-or”).

117,"A particular inn always offers the same nine dishes on its dinner menu: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I. Five foreigners arrive. Nobody tells them which dish corresponds to each letter and so they each select one letter without knowing what they will eat. The innkeeper arrives with the five dishes ordered and puts them in the center of the table so that they can decide who eats what. This goes on for two more nights. The foreigners, who are professors of logic, were able to deduce by the dishes they ordered which letter represents what dish. What could have been the dishes ordered each of the three nights? Note: Each dish was ordered at least once.","If two of the same dish come out, this is an easy deduction!","Let the three suppers be called Night 1, Night 2 and Night 3.
“Ordering a dish” really means “choosing its letter”.
The foreigners can recognise every dish by sight (or taste), so after
the three meals they know, for every real dish, how many times it
appeared on each night.

The trick is to make the
“appearance pattern” of every dish
(unique triple
(number of times it appeared on Night 1,
 number of times it appeared on Night 2,
 number of times it appeared on Night 3))
different from that of every other dish.
Then they simply match each letter with the only dish that has
the same pattern of appearances.

One possible set of orders that does this is

Night 1 A, A, D, E, G  
Night 2 B, B, D, F, H  
Night 3 C, C, E, F, I  

(Here the same letter may be chosen by more than one diner,
so the innkeeper sometimes brings two identical plates.)

Now list, for every dish that appeared, the triple
(times on Night 1, Night 2, Night 3):

A (2,0,0)  only dish served twice on Night 1 and never again  
B (0,2,0)  only dish served twice on Night 2 and never again  
C (0,0,2)  only dish served twice on Night 3 and never again  
D (1,1,0)  served once on Nights 1 & 2, never on Night 3  
E (1,0,1)  served once on Nights 1 & 3, never on Night 2  
F (0,1,1)  served once on Nights 2 & 3, never on Night 1  
G (1,0,0)  served only once, and only on Night 1  
H (0,1,0)  served only once, and only on Night 2  
I (0,0,1)  served only once, and only on Night 3  

All nine triples are different, so each real dish is uniquely
identifiable by its pattern.
Consequently the professors of logic can match the letters
to the dishes unambiguously:

• the dish that appeared (2,0,0) times must be A,  
• the one that appeared (0,2,0) times must be B,  
• … and so on.

Thus after the third supper they know exactly which dish corresponds to
every letter.

118,"When Chidam got his first car, the first thing he had to do was to get a license plate. When he got his plate, he noticed that the plate had a peculiar number with five digits on it. He also noticed that the numbers could be read upside down, but the value of the number had increased by 78633.
Can you help Chidam find the number of his license plate number?","There are only 5 digits from 0 to 9 which can be read upside down. The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","Let the five–digit licence–plate number be  
N = d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅  (d₁ ≠ 0).

When the plate is turned upside-down each digit is replaced by  

0→0 , 1→1 , 6→9 , 8→8 , 9→6 ,

and the order of the digits reverses.  
Thus the “upside-down number’’ is

U = m(d₅) m(d₄) m(d₃) m(d₂) m(d₁)

where m( ) is the mapping above.

We are told that

U − N = 78 633.                         (1)

Translate (1) into place–value terms:

10000 m(d₅) + 1000 m(d₄) + 100 m(d₃) + 10 m(d₂) + m(d₁)  
−(10000 d₁ + 1000 d₂ + 100 d₃ + 10 d₄ + d₅) = 78 633.

Group the five contributions:

(10000 m(d₅) − d₅) + (1000 m(d₄) − 10 d₄)  
+ (100 m(d₃) − 100 d₃) + (10 m(d₂) − 1000 d₂)  
+ (m(d₁) − 10000 d₁) = 78 633.               (2)

Because only 0,1,6,8,9 survive a 180° rotation, each dᵢ is one of these digits.  
Evaluate each bracket for every possible digit:

d   0     1     6     8     9
────────────────────────────────────────
10000 m(d) − d        0  9 999  89 994  79 992  59 991
1000 m(d) − 10d       0    990   8 940   7 920   5 910
100 m(d) − 100d       0      0     300      0    −300
10 m(d) − 1000d       0   −990  −5 910  −7 920  −8 940
m(d) − 10000d         0 −9 999 −59 991 −79 992 −89 994

Now look at the two “end’’ digits first, because their contributions are the largest.

1.  If d₅ = 6, its contribution is +89 994.  
   To end up at +78 633 we would need the other four brackets to sum to
   −11 361, which is impossible (their total range is only ±9 240).

2.  If d₅ = 8, its contribution is +79 992.  
   Try the four possibilities for d₁:

   • d₁ = 1 gives −9 999, net so far +69 993;  
     we still need +8 640 from the middle three digits.

     Choose d₄ = 6  ( +8 940 )  
            d₂ = 0  (     0   )  
            d₃ = 9  ( −300 ).  

     Their sum is +8 640 – exactly what is needed.

     Thus the digits are d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ = 1 0 9 6 8.

   • d₁ = 6, 8 or 9 make the required remainder far too large or negative,
     hence impossible.

3.  If d₅ = 9 or 1 the total can never reach 78 633.

Therefore the only number satisfying (2) is

N = 10968.

Check:  turning 10968 upside-down gives 89601, and  
89601 − 10968 = 78 633, as stated.

Using the 2 fuses how can you create a fuse that burns for exactly 45 minutes. Remember, cutting them does no good since you don't know how long the cut fuse lasts.",,"Step 1 ‑ start everything  
Light the ONE-HOUR fuse at both ends and, at the same instant, light ONE end of the TWO-HOUR fuse.

What this does  
• Because both ends of the one-hour fuse are burning, it will be completely consumed in exactly 30 minutes (irregularities do not matter – the two flames must meet somewhere in half the total time).  
• During those same 30 minutes the two-hour fuse, which is burning at only one end, will have used up 30 minutes’ worth of fuse, so 90 minutes’ worth of fuse remains.

Step 2 ‑ create the 45-minute fuse  
As soon as the one-hour fuse is gone (i.e. exactly 30 minutes after the start), light the OTHER end of the two-hour fuse.  
Now the remaining 90-minute length of the two-hour fuse is burning from both ends, so its remaining burning time is cut in half:

remaining time = 90 min ÷ 2 = 45 minutes.

Step 3 ‑ use it  
From the moment you light that second end you have a fuse that will burn for exactly 45 minutes, irrespective of any irregular burning rate.

122,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Label the twelve coins  

 A B C D E F G H I J K L  

and remember that every time the scale tips we do not yet know whether the odd coin is heavy (pulls its pan down) or light (lets its pan rise).  
All that matters is which pan is seen to be “heavier”.

WEIGHING 1  
Left pan : A  B  C  D  
Right pan: E  F  G  H  

• If the two pans balance, the counterfeit is among the four coins that were not
  weighed (I,J,K,L).  
• If the left pan is heavier, the fake coin is either  
  – heavy among A,B,C,D, or  
  – light among E,F,G,H.  
• If the right pan is heavier, the situation is the mirror image.

Deal with each of these three situations separately.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. FIRST WEIGHING BALANCES  
(The suspect group is I,J,K,L.)

WEIGHING 2  
Left pan : I  J  K  
Right pan: A  B  C (three genuine coins)

• If the pans balance, L is the fake coin.  
  WEIGHING 3 : compare L with any genuine coin (say A).  
  – If L is lighter, it is the odd light coin; if L is heavier, it is the odd heavy coin.

• If the left pan is heavier, one of I,J,K is a heavy counterfeit.  
  WEIGHING 3 : weigh I against J.  
  – If I = J  → K is the heavy fake.  
  – If I ≠ J  → the heavier of the two is the fake.

• If the left pan is lighter, one of I,J,K is a light counterfeit.  
  WEIGHING 3 : weigh I against J.  
  – If I = J  → K is the light fake.  
  – If I ≠ J  → the lighter of the two is the fake.

In every sub-case the counterfeit and its nature are found with three weighings.

2. FIRST WEIGHING, LEFT PAN HEAVIER  
(The suspect coin is heavy in A–D or light in E–H.)

WEIGHING 2  
Left pan : A  B  E  
Right pan: C  D  F

 – If G is lighter → G is the light fake.

• Left pan heavier again  
 → candidates: A heavy, B heavy, or F light.  
  WEIGHING 3 : compare A with B.  
 – If A = B → F is the light fake.  
 – Otherwise the heavier of A,B is the heavy fake.

• Right pan heavier (the direction of tilt has reversed)  
 → candidates: C heavy, D heavy, or E light.  
  WEIGHING 3 : compare C with D.  
 – If C = D → E is the light fake.

WEIGHING 2  
Left pan : E  F  C  
Right pan: G  H  B    (the same pattern, just exchanging sides)

Analyse exactly as in case 2:  
• If the second weighing balances, the fake is the light coin among A,D.  
• If the left pan is heavier again, the fake is heavy among G,H or light C.  
• If the right pan becomes heavier, the fake is heavy among E,F or light B.  
A third weighing of two of the three remaining suspects pin-points the culprit exactly as before.

124,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","Step-by-step reasoning (backward induction)

Notation  
S(N) = “a situation with N lions and 1 sheep”

Goal  
For every N decide whether the sheep is safe (no lion will touch it) or doomed (some lion will certainly eat it).  
A lion will eat the sheep only when he can prove that doing so will not later cause him to be eaten after he turns into a sheep.

Base cases  
N = 0 (0 lions) The sheep is obviously safe.  
N = 1 (1 lion) If the lion eats the sheep he becomes a sheep but there will then be 0 lions, so he cannot be eaten.  
  => In S(1) the lone lion does eat the sheep. The sheep is doomed.

Inductive step  
Suppose we already know what happens in all smaller cases.  
Take S(N) with N ≥ 2 and let an arbitrary lion L consider eating.

• If L eats, the world turns into S(N-1) with L (now a sheep) plus N-1 lions.  
• Therefore L will compare the fate of the sheep in S(N-1):

 – If in S(N-1) the sheep is doomed, then L himself would be doomed, so he will refuse to eat.  
 – If in S(N-1) the sheep is safe, L will be safe, so he will gladly eat.

This gives the recurrence:

 Sheep doomed in S(N)  ⇔  Sheep safe in S(N-1)

Working it out

N = 1 Sheep doomed  (base)  
N = 2 Because N-1 = 1 is “doomed”, S(2) is “safe”  
N = 3 Because N-1 = 2 is “safe”, S(3) is “doomed”  
N = 4 Because N-1 = 3 is “doomed”, S(4) is “safe”  
… and so on.

Thus:

• For every odd N, the sheep in S(N) is doomed (some lion eats it).  
• For every even N, the sheep in S(N) is safe (no lion eats it).

The actual problem

There are 100 lions ⇒ N = 100 (even).

Each lion reasons:

“If I eat the sheep I turn into a sheep in front of 99 lions.  
But with 99 (odd) lions the new sheep would certainly be eaten.  
I refuse to take that risk.”

Since this argument is identical for every lion, none of them will attack.

1. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 7: put the 31-year-old, blue-shirted person who saw 42 trains in the centre seat (position 3).  

2. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 8: put Doug on the far left (position 1) with 26 planes and, because he saw 72 more trains than planes, 98 trains.  

3. (Creative)  Use clue 1 (planes – trains = 44).  The only planes / trains pair that satisfies this is 86 planes and 42 trains, so Bob must have 86 planes and 42 trains – which fixes Bob as the centre (the person already known to have 42 trains).  

4. (Rudimentary)  From clue 3: the far-right person has 174 planes and is 8 years younger than Bob, so his age is 23.  

5. (Rudimentary)  From clue 6: note that Steven’s combination is uniquely 250 planes and 105 trains (name determined, position still open).

127,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).",Induction,"Call a villager who was put on the nomination list a “marked” villager.  
Let the total number of marked villagers be N.

Facts that every villager knows

1. Every villager can see the mark (nomination) on every other villager except on himself.
2. Everybody knows that at least one villager is marked.
3. All villagers are perfect logicians and all of this is common knowledge.

What does a villager reason?

Case N = 1  
The single marked villager sees nobody else marked.  
Because he nevertheless knows that “someone is marked”, he deduces it must be himself and goes to the hall the first night.

Case N = 2  
Each marked villager sees exactly one mark (on the other marked villager).  
Each therefore thinks:

“If I am unmarked there is only one marked villager, and by the previous reasoning he will go the first night.  
If nobody goes the first night, I must be marked too.”

When no one comes forward the first night, both now know they are marked and both go the second night.

Inductive step  
Assume that if exactly k villagers are marked, then none comes during the first k-1 nights and all k come on the k-th night.

Now suppose N = k + 1.  
Each marked villager sees k marked villagers.  
Each reasons:

“If I am not marked, then only k people are marked.  
By the induction hypothesis they will all go on night k.  
So if no one has appeared by the end of night k, I must be marked as well.”

When nights 1 through k pass with nobody appearing, every marked villager reaches that conclusion, and all k+1 go on night k+1.

Therefore

• If the very first appearance is on night t, then exactly t villagers were nominated (marked).  
• In the story the first appearance happens on night 30, so N = 30.

Hence 30 villagers—every one of the nominees—came forward on the 30th night.

128,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?","""Kids"" can mean something else","The whole story pivots on the double meaning of the word “kid.”  
Nothing in the tale ever says the culprits are human children; a “kid” is also a young goat.  
Seen that way everything fits:

• Three goat-kids wander into (or “raid”) the grocery, chew on or knock down produce, then bolt.  
• Goats are notorious for suddenly turning and butting or chasing people; Old Man Justice stumbles into a ditch while fleeing them and is hurt.  
• When he recovers he can easily “identify the culprits” (the three goats).  
• He and two other people who have also had trouble with the same animals round them up.  

At the ceremonial “Repast of Right” his poem makes sense:

– “As we eat, our justice is served” – they are literally going to eat the animals.  
– “Not an eye for an eye, but rather one for two” – instead of exact retribution they will simply make a meal of them.  
– “No more shall they breathe” – the goats will be slaughtered.  
– The speaker insists they are “not cannibals,” because they are eating goat meat, not human flesh.

Therefore the “punishment” of the three guilty kids is that they are killed, cooked and eaten at the dinner.

  ½° / 6° = 1⁄12 line per minute.  
  Therefore its position is H(t) = t / 12  (mod 60).

The problem states that the hour hand is exactly on a line; thus H(t) must be an integer.
Write H(t) = k where k is an integer line-number (0,1,…,59).  
That forces t = 12k. Substitute this value of t in the conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------

 With t = 12k: M(t) = 12k ≡ k + 1 (mod 60)  
  ⇒ 11k ≡ 1 (mod 60).

11 and 60 are coprime, and 11⁻¹ ≡ 11 (mod 60) because 11·11 = 121 ≡ 1.  
Hence k ≡ 11·1 ≡ 11 (mod 60).

Within one revolution (0 – 59) that gives k = 11.

Time after noon: t = 12k = 12·11 = 132 minutes = 2 h 12 min.

2.  Minute hand on the PREVIOUS line

 Again with t = 12k: 12k ≡ k – 1 (mod 60)  
  ⇒ 11k ≡ –1 ≡ 59 (mod 60).

Multiply by the inverse of 11 (which is 11):

  k ≡ 11·59 = 649 ≡ 49 (mod 60).

So k = 49.

132,"Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?",Why did they stop on their way to school?,"Let the day on which the children are talking be T.

Step 1.  Translate the two odd-sounding clauses into shifts of time.

• “The day after tomorrow” (relative to T) is T + 2.  
  In how many days will that very day be “yesterday”?  
  If we move ahead 3 days, then T + 2 will indeed be (T + 3) – 1, i.e. “yesterday”.  
  Therefore

  when “the day after tomorrow is yesterday” we are 3 days after today, i.e. on T + 3.

• “The day before yesterday” (relative to T) is T – 2.  
  How long ago was that same day “tomorrow”?  
  Going back 3 days does it, because (T – 3) + 1 = T – 2.  
  Hence

  when “the day before yesterday was tomorrow” we were 3 days before today, i.e. on T – 3.

So the puzzle is comparing the day 3 days in the future (T + 3) with the day 3 days in the past (T – 3).

Step 2.  Express the condition given.

Priscilla says that when we get to T + 3, the day then called “today” will be as far from Sunday as the day T – 3 was from Sunday.  In symbols

  distance(T + 3 , Sunday) = distance(T – 3 , Sunday).

“Distance from Sunday” is simply the number of days you must move, either forward or backward, to reach Sunday:

 Sunday 0, Monday 1, Tuesday 2, Wednesday 3, Thursday 3, Friday 2, Saturday 1.

Step 3.  Check which choice of T satisfies the equality.

For each possible T:

 T = Sunday        distance(T + 3 = Wednesday) = 3  
        distance(T – 3 = Thursday ) = 3   ✓

 T = Monday        4 vs 2 ✗  
 T = Tuesday       2 vs 1 ✗  
 T = Wednesday     1 vs 0 ✗  
 T = Thursday      0 vs 1 ✗  
 T = Friday        1 vs 2 ✗  
 T = Saturday      2 vs 3 ✗

Only Sunday satisfies the required equality.

Therefore the children’s conversation must have taken place on a Sunday.

8. Steeplechasers are vegetarians.",,"Reasoning step by step  

Let the predicates be  
A(x): x is an alligator  
H(x): x watches (can watch) hockey games  
S(x): x is a steeplechaser  
V(x): x is a vegetarian  

The three crucial statements are

Chain the last two universal statements:

H(x) → S(x) and S(x) → V(x) ⇒ H(x) → V(x).  
So anyone who watches hockey is a vegetarian.

From (3) we know there exists an x such that A(x) ∧ H(x).  
For that same x, H(x) → V(x) gives V(x).  
Hence ∃x (A(x) ∧ V(x)).

134,"Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?",The fraction is in sevenths,"Biggie’s will really contained two separate directions, one that would have applied if the child had been a boy and one that would have applied if the child had been a girl.  
Because a boy and a girl were born, both directions became valid “claims” on the estate.

Write the two directions exactly as they stand and add up the resulting claims:

• “If a boy is born” → boy 2⁄3 , widow 1⁄3.  
• “If a girl is born” → girl 1⁄3 , widow 2⁄3.

Hence the raw claims are  

 boy  2⁄3  
 girl  1⁄3  
 widow 1⁄3 + 2⁄3 = 1  

Total claimed = 2, i.e. twice the estate.  
Whenever the valid claims exceed what actually exists, the standard equitable remedy is to satisfy every claim in the same proportion: divide every claim by the same factor so that the total becomes 1 (the whole estate).  
Here the factor is 2.

Divide each claim by 2:

 widow   1 ÷ 2 = 1⁄2  
 boy   (2⁄3) ÷ 2 = 1⁄3  
 girl   (1⁄3) ÷ 2 = 1⁄6

1. (Rudimentary)  Draw a 2 × 4 chart of positions (A-D on the top row, E-H on the bottom row) and list all eight boys, girls, schools and songs for later elimination.  

2. (R)  From clue 8, write “Let’s Twist Again” in square A.  

3. (R)  From clue 2, note that the songs in positions C, F and H are “Twist and Shout”, “Dear Lady Twist” and “Twistin’ USA”, in some order.  

4. (R)  From clue 3, record that Cindy + Lincoln H.S. asked for “Twistin’ USA”; therefore Cindy’s couple must be in C, F or H.  

5. (R)  From clue 2, the Lakewood couple asked for “Twist and Shout” and is not in F, so Lakewood must be in C or H.  

6. (R)  From clue 3, Wendy’s couple asked for “Twisting the Night Away”; therefore Wendy is not in C, F, or H.  

7. (R)  From clue 6, mark the four corner positions A, D, E, H as (i) Laverne’s couple, (ii) Jenny’s couple, (iii) the Washington H.S. couple and (iv) the “Twist, Twist, Senora” couple, in some order.  Because A already has “Let’s Twist Again”, A cannot be the “Twist, Twist, Senora” corner.  

8. (Creative)  Realise that “corner” in this puzzle means “end of the restaurant”, so the diagonally opposite pairs are A-H and D-E.  Label these pairs for later use with the diagonal information in clue 5.  

9. (C)  Apply clue 5:  One diagonal pair is Ricky & the Roosevelt H.S. couple; the other diagonal pair is Bill & the Jefferson H.S. couple.  Conclude that Roosevelt and Jefferson must each be in a corner, and Bill and Ricky must each occupy the opposite corner on their respective diagonals.  

10. (R)  From clue 1, Bill is not the Washington couple; therefore if Washington occupies a corner, it can only share a diagonal with Ricky, not Bill.  

11. (C)  List the two ways to satisfy step 9:  
 • Possibility 1 – diagonal A-H:  Ricky / Roosevelt, diagonal D-E: Bill / Jefferson  
 • Possibility 2 – diagonal A-H:  Bill / Jefferson, diagonal D-E: Ricky / Roosevelt  
   (Any other pairing violates clue 5.)  

12. (R)  Because neither George nor Tony is Roosevelt (clue 1), if either sits in a Roosevelt corner the assignment fails; keep that restriction beside the two possibilities.  

13. (C)  Work with the “same-side” information in clue 4: Curt & partner, Roosevelt couple and Sheryl & partner share a row.  Note that whichever row contains Roosevelt must also hold Curt and Sheryl.  

14. (R)  Examine Possibility 1 from step 11.  If, for example, corner H (bottom-right) is Roosevelt/Ricky, then Curt and Sheryl must also be on the bottom row (E-H).  Track the adjacent/next-to information in clue 7 and quickly see that Sheryl cannot satisfy the “not next to Nancy or Laverne” condition if she must be bottom-row with Ricky already occupying one end.  Reject this placement; iterating similarly forces Roosevelt to be in the top row.  

15. (R)  The only workable placement inside Possibility 1 is therefore:

 D – Bill & Jefferson E – (unknown)  

16. (C)  Because Roosevelt has now been fixed at A (top-left), Curt and Sheryl must also be in the top row (B or C or D).  Bill is in corner D, so Curt and Sheryl must be in B and C in some order.  

17. (R)  From clue 3, Donald’s couple (not Oceanside) asked for “The Peppermint Twist”.  Because C carries one of the three special songs (step 3) and D is Bill, Donald cannot be in C or D, so Donald is in B.  Consequently Sheryl, Donald’s partner from clue 3, is the girl in B.  (This satisfies the “same-side” requirement with Roosevelt.)  

18. (R)  That puts Curt in C.  By step 3, C must hold one of the special songs; from clue 2 the Lakewood couple asking for “Twist and Shout” is either C or H and not F, so Curt’s couple must be the Lakewood / “Twist and Shout” pair in C.  Laurie is therefore Curt’s partner (from clue 1, Washington is not Laurie’s school).  

19. (C)  Because Cindy must have “Twistin’ USA” (step 4) and “Twistin’ USA” is still unassigned inside C, F, H, but C is now “Twist and Shout”, Cindy must be in F or H.  Since Lakewood (C) already took “Twist and Shout” and Roosevelt (A) took “Let’s Twist Again”, the only left-over special-song slots are “Dear Lady Twist” and “Twistin’ USA”.  

20. (R)  Use clue 8: the Westerberg couple (Nancy) is vertically opposite Washington, and one of those two couples took “Dear Lady Twist”.  The only seat vertically opposite another corner seat is a C-G or B-F or D-H or A-E pair.  A already holds Roosevelt, so Washington cannot be A; Washington must be H, and Westerberg (Nancy) must be D (directly above H).  Assign “Dear Lady Twist” to one of D or H, to be settled shortly.  

21. (R)  Washington is now in H.  From step 7, H is one of the four special-corner values; that corner list already contained Washington, so the list is still coherent.  Since Washington is in H, H is no longer available for Laverne/Jenny/“Twist, Twist Senora”.  The only remaining unnamed corner tasks are “Twist, Twist, Senora” and whichever of Laverne/Jenny hasn’t been placed yet.  

22. (C)  Sheryl (in B) must not sit next to Nancy or Laverne (clue 7).  Nancy is in D, so Sheryl is safe on that side; thus Laverne cannot be in C or A (next to B) and must sit in E, making Steve & Laverne the couple in E (because Cindy must sit to Steve’s right per clue 7, and E is immediately left of F).  That satisfies the Jefferson-corner requirement: the couple in E therefore attends Jefferson, matching clue 5 (Bill’s diagonal partner).  

23. (R)  With E identified as Steve & Laverne / Jefferson / unknown song, the song list in corners now shows “Twist, Twist Senora” still free; by elimination it goes to D with Bill & Nancy, satisfying clue 6 completely.  “Dear Lady Twist” therefore belongs to H (Washington / Ricky & Veronica).  

24. (R)  Cindy must be to the right of Steve (clue 7), so Cindy’s couple is F.  That fills the special-song set: F is “Twistin’ USA”, Lincoln, George & Cindy (from clue 1 George isn’t Roosevelt so this is consistent).  

25. (R)  The last open seat G receives the remaining boy-girl pair, Tony & Wendy, and the only school and song still unused, Oceanside / “Twisting the Night Away”.

Because A already has “Let’s Twist Again”, A cannot be the “Twist, Twist, Senora” corner.  \n\n8.

Label these pairs for later use with the diagonal information in clue 5.  \n\n9. (C)  Apply clue 5:  One diagonal pair is Ricky & the Roosevelt H.S. couple; the other diagonal pair is Bill & the Jefferson H.S. couple.  Conclude that Roosevelt and Jefferson must each be in a corner, and Bill and Ricky must each occupy the opposite corner on their respective diagonals.  \n\n10. (R)  From clue 1, Bill is not the Washington couple; therefore if Washington occupies a corner, it can only share a diagonal with Ricky, not Bill.  \n\n11.

(R)  Because neither George nor Tony is Roosevelt (clue 1), if either sits in a Roosevelt corner the assignment fails; keep that restriction beside the two possibilities.  \n\n13. (C)  Work with the “same-side” information in clue 4: Curt & partner, Roosevelt couple and Sheryl & partner share a row.  Note that whichever row contains Roosevelt must also hold Curt and Sheryl.  \n\n14. (R)  Examine Possibility 1 from step 11.  If, for example, corner H (bottom-right) is Roosevelt/Ricky, then Curt and Sheryl must also be on the bottom row (E-H).  Track the adjacent/next-to information in clue 7 and quickly see that Sheryl cannot satisfy the “not next to Nancy or Laverne” condition if she must be bottom-row with Ricky already occupying one end.  Reject this placement; iterating similarly forces Roosevelt to be in the top row.  \n\n15.

137,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"Reasoning:

Let the four two-digit “sets” be  
A (first), B (second), C (third), D (fourth).

1) C’s digit–sum is 11, 12, or 13.  
2) D = C + 13.  
3) A = 2 B + 7.  
4) digit-sum(D) > digit-sum(A).  
5) Digits 0,3,6 never appear; digits 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 all must appear at least once.  
6) A is a two-digit perfect square with no 0,3,6.

Step 1 – find A and B from (3) and (6).

The two-digit squares without 0,3,6 are 25, 49, 81.
 25 ⇒ B = (25-7)/2 = 9  (one digit, has 0 forbidden digit 0) → reject.  
 49 ⇒ B = (49-7)/2 = 21  ✓ (21 has allowed digits and two digits).  
 81 ⇒ B = (81-7)/2 = 37 (contains forbidden 3) → reject.

Thus A = 49 and B = 21.

Step 2 – find C and D.

C must have digit-sum 11–13 and contain no 0,3,6; D = C + 13 must also avoid 0,3,6 and have digit-sum > 13.

Checking all possibilities:

C   D=C+13  digit-sum(C)  digit-sum(D)  OK?
74   87          11            15        (needs digit 5 later)  
75   88          12            16        GOOD  
84   97          12            16        (needs digit 5 later)  
85   98          13            17        (needs digit 7 later)

Step 3 – cover all required digits.

With A-B already giving digits 4,9,2,1, we still need 5,7,8 somewhere.

Pair (75,88) contributes 7,5,8 (and another 8), so every required digit 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 now appears exactly (or at least) once, with no 0,3,6 anywhere.

Pairs (74,87), (84,97), (85,98) fail to supply all needed digits.

Thus the only valid choice is C = 75 and D = 88.

Step 4 – verify all clues:

A = 49 (square)  
B = 21 (2 × 21 + 7 = 49)  
C = 75 (digit-sum 12)  
D = 88 (C + 13, digit-sum 16 > digit-sum(49)=13)  
Digits 0,3,6 absent; digits 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 all present.

139,"There are three students Anu, Bob and Coy. They have exactly three books - one on Physics, one on Chemistry and one on Math. Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"Let  

 P , C , M denote the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books respectively  
 (T , L , A) denote a student who tells the truth in all his statements, lies in all his
statements, or gives a mixture of true and false statements.

The six statements we have to examine are  

 Anu : P = A ; M ≠ B ; C ≠ C           (1a)(1b)(1c)  
 Bob : P ≠ B ; C = C ; M ≠ A           (2a)(2b)(2c)  
 Coy : P ≠ A ; M ≠ C ; C ≠ B           (3a)(3b)(3c)

(Exactly one of the three students is of type T, one of type L and the third of type A.  
Each of the three books is owned by a different student – there are only three books and three students.)

1. Bob cannot be the truth-teller  
 If Bob were T, (2b) would give C = C (the chemistry book is Coy’s).  
 The liar must then be either Anu or Coy.

 • If Anu were L, (1a) would make P ≠ A, (1b) would force M = B, and (1c) keeps
   C = C.  But then Coy’s three statements (3a)(3b)(3c) are all true, so Coy would be T,
   contradicting Bob’s being T.

 • If Coy were L, his third (3c) would make C = B, contradicting C = C from Bob’s truth.  

 Hence Bob cannot be the truth-teller.

2. Coy cannot be the truth-teller  
 Let Coy be T.  Then from (3a)(3b)(3c)
  P ≠ A, M ≠ C, C ≠ B.                               (4)

  (a) Let Anu be L.  Then (1b) (false) gives M = B and (1c) (false) gives C = C.  
   But now Bob’s statements evaluate as
    (2a) P ≠ B ?   (2b) C = C   (2c) M ≠ A,  
   and whichever student owns P, Bob’s three statements are either all true or all false;
   he cannot be the alternating speaker.  Impossible.

  (b) Let Bob be L.  Then (2a)(false) gives P = B, (2b)(false) gives C ≠ C, i.e. C = A,  
   and (2c)(false) gives M = A – the same student (Anu) owns two books, which is
   prohibited.  Hence Coy cannot be T.

3. Therefore Anu is the only possible truth-teller  
 So (1a)(1b)(1c) are all true, giving

  P = A , M ≠ B , C ≠ C.                           (5)

4. Determining the liar and the alternating speaker  
 If Bob were the liar, (2a)(false) would make P = B, contradicting P = A in (5).  
 Hence Bob cannot be L.  Therefore Coy is L and Bob is A (alternating).

 Coy’s three statements must all be false:  

  (3a) false ⇒ P = A    (already true)  
  (3b) false ⇒ M = C  
  (3c) false ⇒ C = B.                                (6)

 With (6) the three books are all owned by different students:

  Physics → Anu  
  Chemistry → Bob  
  Maths → Coy.

 Bob’s statements now come out T-F-T, exactly the required mixture.

The arrangement below is the only one that satisfies every condition:

 Owner of Physics : Anu  
 Owner of Chemistry: Bob  
 Owner of Maths  : Coy  

 Anu = T (always tells the truth)  
 Bob = A (alternates)  
 Coy = L (always lies)

5. What can we conclude?

 1) “Anu always tells the truth.”   True in the unique solution.  
 2) “Coy always lies.”        True in the unique solution.  
 3) “Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.” True in the unique solution.

Since this solution is unique, all three statements follow inevitably from the
information given.

140,"A king heard that the nearby kingdoms were being destroyed by a fierce dragon. He called forth his most trusted and skilled knights to meet and plan how to protect the kingdom.  The 6 knights, Sir William, Sir Andrew, Sir Luke, Sir Calvin, Sir Charles and Sir Vincent, decided that two knights would venture out to find and slay the dragon while the other 4 would defend the kingdom.
From the statements below, which two knights went to seek the dragon?
1. If neither Sir William or Sir Vincent rode out, then Sir Calvin did.
2. If either Sir Calvin or Sir Vincent went to kill the dragon, then Sir Andrew did not.
3.  If neither Sir Andrew or Sir William were of the brave two that left the kingdom, then Sir Charles was.
4.  If neither Sir Luke or Sir Andrew went out, then Sir Vincent did.
5. If Sir William was one of the two, then either Sir Calvin or Sir Charles was with him.
6. If Sir Vincent was not of the two who went to slay the dragon, then neither was Sir Andrew nor Sir Charles.","If statement 1 is valid, Calvin was one of the two that left.

A = “Sir Andrew went”,  
L = “Sir Luke went”,  
C = “Sir Calvin went”,  
Ch = “Sir Charles went”,

Exactly two of the six variables are TRUE.

Translate each statement:

1. (¬W ∧ ¬V) → C                ( If neither W nor V went, then C did.)
2. (C ∨ V) → ¬A                 ( If C or V went, A did not.)

Case analysis on Vincent.

────────────────────────
Case 1. V is FALSE.

From (6): A = FALSE and Ch = FALSE.  
From (4): V is false ⇒ L ∨ A is true ⇒ L is TRUE (since A is false).  
Currently: L true.

From (3): ¬A ∧ ¬W ⇒ Ch.  A is false, Ch is false, so ¬W must be false ⇒ W is TRUE.  
Now we have L and W both true (already two knights).  
From (5): W true ⇒ C or Ch true.  Ch is false, so C must be TRUE – giving three knights.  
Contradiction.  Therefore V cannot be false.

────────────────────────
Case 2. V is TRUE.

Then by (2): A is FALSE.  
We still need exactly one more knight besides V.

Sub-case 2a.  W is TRUE.  
(5) demands C or Ch true as well → would give at least three knights.  Impossible.

Sub-case 2b.  L is TRUE (with W false, C false, Ch false).  
Because A and W are false, (3) forces Ch TRUE → again at least three knights.  Impossible.

Sub-case 2c.  C is TRUE (with W false, L false, Ch false).  
Again A and W are false, so (3) forces Ch TRUE → three knights.  Impossible.

Sub-case 2d.  Ch is TRUE (with W false, L false, C false).  
Check all statements:

1. (¬W ∧ ¬V) is false (V is true) – statement satisfied.  
2. (C ∨ V) is true, so ¬A required; A is false – satisfied.  
3. (¬A ∧ ¬W) is true (A, W both false) ⇒ Ch must be true – satisfied.  
4. (¬L ∧ ¬A) is true (L false, A false) ⇒ V must be true – satisfied.  
5. W is false – no condition.  
6. V is true – no condition.

All statements are satisfied and exactly two knights (V and Ch) went.

Therefore the only consistent pair is Sir Vincent and Sir Charles.

141,"Mad Ade's cousin Steve lies a lot. He tells the truth on only one day in a week.
One day he said: ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.""
The next day he said: ""Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.""
The next day he said: ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.""
On which day of the week does Steve tell the truth?",The first and third statements are incompatible,"Reasoning in full:

1.  Let T be the unique day of the week on which Steve tells the truth; all other days he lies.

2.  Interpret each statement:

    •  S₁ (made on Day 1):  “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.”
        –  This is true exactly when T is not Monday or Tuesday.

    •  S₂ (made on Day 2):  “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.”
        –  This is true exactly when Day 2 ∈ {Sunday, Saturday, Thursday}.

    •  S₃ (made on Day 3):  “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.”
        –  This is true exactly when T is not Friday or Wednesday.

3.  Logical link between truth of a statement and the day:

    •  A statement spoken on a day D is true ⇔ D = T,
       and false ⇔ D ≠ T.

4.  Consequences for S₁ and S₃:

    S₁:  D₁ = T  ⇔  T ∉ {Monday, Tuesday}.  
    S₃:  D₃ = T  ⇔  T ∉ {Friday, Wednesday}.

    If T were neither in {Mon, Tue} nor in {Wed, Fri}, both D₁ and D₃ would have to be T, impossible because D₃ is two days after D₁.  
    Hence T must lie in one (and only one) of those two pairs:

        Case A:  T ∈ {Monday, Tuesday}.  
        Case B:  T ∈ {Wednesday, Friday}.

5.  Examine Case A (T = Monday or Tuesday).
    
    –  Here S₁ is false, so D₁ ≠ T; S₃ is true, so D₃ = T.  
    –  Consecutive-day structure forces:

         If T = Monday:  D₃ = Monday → D₂ = Sunday → D₁ = Saturday.  
             On D₂ (Sunday) Steve must lie, but S₂ (“Today is … Sunday …”) would be true ⇒ contradiction.  
         If T = Tuesday: D₃ = Tuesday → D₂ = Monday → D₁ = Sunday.  
             •  D₁ (Sunday): S₁ is false, consistent with lying.  
             •  D₂ (Monday): S₂ is false (“Monday” not in the stated set), consistent with lying.  
             •  D₃ (Tuesday): S₃ is true, consistent with telling the truth.  
         Hence T = Tuesday works.

6.  Examine Case B (T = Wednesday or Friday).

    –  Here S₁ is true, so D₁ = T; S₃ is false, so D₃ ≠ T.  
      Then D₂ cannot be T either (because T ∉ {Sunday, Saturday, Thursday}), so D₂ is also a lying day.

         If T = Wednesday: D₁ = Wednesday → D₂ = Thursday → D₃ = Friday.  
             On D₂ (Thursday) Steve must lie, but S₂ would be true (“Thursday” in the set) ⇒ contradiction.  
         If T = Friday: D₁ = Friday → D₂ = Saturday → D₃ = Sunday.  
             On D₂ (Saturday) Steve must lie, but S₂ again would be true ⇒ contradiction.  
      Both possibilities fail.

142,"Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?",Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.,"Let the six cheese-weights be  

15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 31   (all in pounds).

Exactly one of them is the Chillirella (C); the other five are Kebabrie.

1.  Norma bought two Kebabrie pieces.  
   Let their weights be a and b, so
        W_N = a + b.

2.  Laura bought Kebabrie whose total weight is twice Norma’s:
        W_L = 2·W_N.

3.  The customers together bought only Kebabrie, so the total weight sold is
        W_N + W_L = 3·W_N.

4.  Therefore the weight left in the shop (the unsold Chillirella) is

        C = (total weight of all six pieces) – (total weight sold)
          = 119 – 3·W_N,
   because 15+16+18+19+20+31 = 119.

5.  For C to be one of the listed weights, 119 – 3·W_N must equal one of
   15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 31.  
   Try every possible W_N (sum of two distinct listed weights):

   a+b  | 3·W_N | 119 – 3·W_N
   --------------------------------
   15+16=31 | 93 | 26   (not in list)
   15+18=33 | 99 | 20   ← possible
   15+19=34 |102 | 17
   15+20=35 |105 | 14
   15+31=46 |138 | –19

   19+20=39 |117 | 2
   19+31=50 |150 | –31
   20+31=51 |153 | –34

   The only line that gives a value still on the list is W_N = 33,
   yielding C = 20.

6.  Check that Laura can actually obtain twice Norma’s weight without using
   the Chillirella piece (20 lb):

   Norma’s pieces: 15 lb and 18 lb  (total 33 lb).  
   Remaining weights: 16, 19, 20, 31.  
   Laura can take 16 + 19 + 31 = 66 lb, which is exactly twice 33 lb and

143,"Twelve men are in a room, some of them always tell lies, while the others always tell the truth.
The first man says: ""None of us is a truthteller.""
The second man says: ""At most one of us is a truthteller.""
The third man says: ""At most two of us are truthtellers.""
...
The twelfth and last man says: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers.""
Who are the liars?","It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","Let  
T = the number of truthtellers among the twelve men.

Statement made by man i (i = 1,…,12):  
“ At most (i − 1) of us are truthtellers.”

So statement S₁: “At most 0 …”, S₂: “At most 1 …”, …, S₁₂: “At most 11 …”.

If a man is a truthteller, his statement must be true; if he is a liar, his statement is false.

For a fixed value of T, statement Sᵢ is true exactly when  
T ≤ (i − 1), i.e. when i ≥ T + 1.

Thus for that T the indices of the truthtellers are  
{ i | i ≥ T + 1 }.

The number of such indices is 12 − T.  
But that number must itself equal T (because it is the number of truthtellers).

Therefore
T = 12 − T  
⇒ 2T = 12  
⇒ T = 6.

So exactly six men tell the truth, namely those with indices i ≥ 7 (men 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).

1. Middle card is the jack  
   – The man answers randomly, but both L and R are aces.  
   – Whether he says Yes or No you will turn over one of those two aces.

2. Middle card is an ace (so exactly one of L and R is the other ace).

3. Mrs. Jones played against her sister.
4. Mr. Johnson played against his father-in-law.
5. Mrs. Smith's partner was her daughter.
6. Mrs. Williams partner was her grandfather.
7. Mr. Johnson's partner was a man.","From statements 3, 5 and 6 the four couples consist of 3 generations since there is a set of sisters involved and there are grandparents present.","Reasoning

1.  Let the four couples be  
   – Mr & Mrs Johnson  
   – Mr & Mrs Jones  
   – Mr & Mrs Smith  
   – Mr & Mrs Williams  

2.  Translate the seven clues.

   (1)  Mrs Johnson’s partner = her son-in-law.  
   (2)  Mr Jones’s partner = his wife’s brother-in-law.  
   (3)  Mrs Jones played against her sister.  
   (4)  Mr Johnson played against his father-in-law.  
   (5)  Mrs Smith’s partner = her daughter.  
   (6)  Mrs Williams’s partner = her grandfather.  
   (7)  Mr Johnson’s partner is a man.

3.  Work out the family relationships that make all of those statements possible.

   •  Because of (5) Mrs Smith must be of the oldest generation; one of the three other wives is her married daughter.  
   •  By (6) Mrs Williams belongs to the youngest generation; one of the three other men is her grandfather.  
   •  By (4) Mrs Johnson also cannot be of the youngest generation, because her father is still alive and playing.  
   •  A three-generation chain that fits is  

           Mr & Mrs Smith  →  their daughters Mrs Johnson and Mrs Jones  
           Mrs Johnson     →  her daughter Mrs Williams  

     Hence  
       – Mr Smith is father of Mrs Johnson and Mrs Jones, therefore grandfather of Mrs Williams.  
       – Mr Williams is son-in-law of Mrs Johnson.  

4.  Form the partnerships required by the clues.

   •  From (1)  Mrs Johnson partners her son-in-law ⇒ Mrs Johnson + Mr Williams.  
   •  From (5)  Mrs Smith partners her daughter ⇒ Mrs Smith + Mrs Jones.  
   •  From (6)  Mrs Williams partners her grandfather ⇒ Mrs Williams + Mr Smith.  
   •  That leaves Mr Johnson and Mr Jones; by (7) they must be partners ⇒ Mr Johnson + Mr Jones.

5.  Check clue (2).  
   Mr Jones’s partner is Mr Johnson.  
   For Mrs Jones, Mr Johnson is her sister’s (Mrs Johnson’s) husband, i.e. her brother-in-law.  
   So clue (2) is satisfied.

6.  Seat the partnerships at two tables so that the “against” conditions (3) and (4) hold.

   Table 1  
     Partnership A : Mrs Johnson & Mr Williams  
     Partnership B : Mrs Smith & Mrs Jones

   Table 2  
     Partnership C : Mr Johnson & Mr Jones  
     Partnership D : Mrs Williams & Mr Smith

j)  Skip the next statement.
k)  Skip the next two statements.
l)  Skip the next three statements.
m)  End.","The first two steps are ""a"" and ""d"", in that order.","Reasoning (outline)

1. We first need an initial weighing; put a) (A vs B) first.
2. Depending on that result we either:
   – enter the “A–branch’’ (A > B), in which case we must jump over the B-branch and weigh A vs C, or  
   – stay in the B-branch (B > A) and weigh B vs C.

   The instruction that can jump over exactly three statements is d); therefore let d) follow a).

3. Immediately after d) place the B-branch weighing and the test that depends on it: b) (B vs C) and f) (“If B is heavier …’’).

4. Inside the B-branch we still need a device that, when B < C, drops us into the “C is heaviest’’ part, but when B > C, skips forward to “mark B’’.  
   f) skips five statements, so we arrange exactly five statements after f) that belong to (or are jumped over from) the B-branch.  
   We use k) (“skip next two’’) as the first of those five; the remaining four will be supplied later.

5. The instruction that begins the A-branch, c) (A vs C), must be reached when A > B (i.e. after d)’s three-statement jump) and skipped when B-branch uses k).  
   Therefore c) follows k).

6. After c) we need to decide between A and C.  e) (“If A is heavier skip next four’’) accomplishes that.  

7. The first statement executed when C turns out to be heaviest must be i) (“mark C’’).  
   Then we need l) (“skip next three’’) so that, once C is marked, we jump over the later “mark B’’ and “mark A’’ and go straight to End.

8. Immediately after the three-statement area that l) will jump over, we put the “mark B’’ statement h).  
   Following h) we need to skip over “mark A’’ but still reach End; j) (“skip next statement’’) does that.

9. The next statement is g) (“mark A’’).  
   Finally, put m) (“End’’) last.

Putting the letters in the discovered order gives:

a  d  b  f  k  c  e  i  l  h  j  g  m

One guard came in through door A and a second entered through door F. They unlocked the cell door. ""We shall set you free,"" said one of the guards, ""but first you must pass through all six doors, each door once only, in the correct order. Three are entrances only and three are exits only. Door A must be followed by door B or E; B by C or E; C by D or F; D by A or F; E by B or D; and F by C or D."" With that the guards left through door B.

• A , F are known to be entrances (the two guards came ​into the guardroom through them);  
• B is known to be an exit        (the guards went ​out through it).

Since exactly three doors are entrances-only and three are exits-only, one more door must be an entrance and the remaining two doors must be exits.

While the prisoner is in the guard-room he must

exit → enter → exit → enter → exit → enter,

so a valid six–door route must alternate exit and entrance doors and must obey the “follow-on” rules

A→(B,E) B→(C,E) C→(D,F) D→(A,F) E→(B,D) F→(C,D).

5. (Creative) Combine clues 13 and 3.  Clue 13 says Fymphy must love an organism that is both herbivore and carnivore, i.e. humans; clue 3 says the creature that loves humans is from a gas planet, so Fymphy’s planet is Jupiter.  
6. (Creative) Link clues 5 and 6.  Because Fymphy loves humans (step 5), clue 5 forces Lymfry to hate humans; clue 6 then sends the “one who hates humans” to Pluto, so Lymfry’s planet is Pluto.

152,"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?",You can cut pills in half,"Reasoning step-by-step

1. At the moment you are holding three indistinguishable tablets:  
   • 1 Sildenafil (S)  
   • 2 Citrate (C₁ , C₂)

2. Because the tablets are perfect squares you can cut them cleanly into equal halves.

3. Cut each of the three tablets in your hand in half.  
   Now you have six halves:

      – ½S  +  ½S  
      – ½C₁ + ½C₁  
      – ½C₂ + ½C₂  

4. Make two piles, A and B, putting one half of every original tablet in each pile:

      Pile A : ½S + ½C₁ + ½C₂  
      Pile B : ½S + ½C₁ + ½C₂  

   Each pile therefore contains exactly
      • one-half of a Sildenafil tablet, and  
      • two one-half Citrate tablets (i.e. the equivalent of one whole Citrate).

   So every pile is short by ½ Sildenafil.

5. Open the Sildenafil bottle, take one fresh Sildenafil tablet, and cut it in half.

6. Add one half of that fresh Sildenafil to pile A and the other half to pile B.

      Pile A : (½S + ½S) + (½C₁ + ½C₂) = 1 S + 1 C  
      Pile B : (½S + ½S) + (½C₁ + ½C₂) = 1 S + 1 C  

   Now each pile contains exactly one full dose.

153,"The first chess tournament ended. Bab, Beb, Bib, Bob and Bub became good friends, and returned to their houses.
They told their wives about the tournament. Their wives were also chess players, and they decided to hold another tournament.
This time, each of the 10 players was going to play against each other player once, with an exception that no games were played between the couples. So a total of 40 games would be played.
After some days passed, they decided to have a get-together. Bub asked the other people how many matches until then they had played.
Something fun was that Bub heard 9 different answers.
How many matches until then had Mrs. Bub played?","If you can't figure it out, draw a diagram.","Call every player’s number of games already played his / her “score”.  
Because no-one can play the spouse, the highest possible score is 8 and the
lowest is 0, so the only possible scores are  

0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .             (1)

Bub asked the other nine people and got nine different answers, so the nine
scores he heard must be exactly the nine numbers listed in (1).

---------------------------------------------------
1.  The couple 0 – 8

Among the nine answers there is a score 8.  
That player has already played everybody except the spouse, so the only
person not played is the spouse.  
If the player whose score is 0 were not that spouse, then the 8-player would
have played him / her, contradicting the fact that the 0-player has played
nobody.  
Therefore the 0-player and the 8-player are married.

---------------------------------------------------
2.  Remove that couple

Delete the couple (0,8) and the eight games of the 8-player.
For every one of the remaining eight players the score falls by 1; the 0-
player disappears.  
Hence the eight remaining scores are the eight different numbers  

0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .             (2)

---------------------------------------------------
3.  Repeat

In (2) the player who now shows 6 has again played everybody except the
spouse, so the one who now shows 0 must be that spouse.  
Remove this second couple and the six games of the 6-player; the six scores
left are  

0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .                     (3)

Doing the same thing once more, the player with 4 must be married to the one
with 0; removing them leaves the two last players, whose (reduced) scores are

0 , 0 .                                 (4)

---------------------------------------------------
4.  What number is duplicated?

Tracing the reductions backwards:

• the couple in (4) both had score 4 before their six common opponents were
   lowered,
• every other couple consisted of two different numbers (0&8, 0&6, 0&4).

Thus, in the original list of scores the only number that can appear twice is
4; every other number appears at most once.

---------------------------------------------------
5.  Apply it to Bub

Among the nine answers Bub heard every number except the one that is equal to
his own score: that number is the only one that can be repeated, namely 4.
Consequently both Bub and Mrs Bub had played 4 games each.

Therefore Mrs Bub had already played 4 matches.

Rudimentary Steps: 7  

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary) Introduce the notion of a player’s “score” as the number of games he or she has already played.  

2. (Rudimentary) Note that, because no-one can play his or her spouse, the maximum possible score is 8 and the minimum is 0, so the only possible scores are 0 – 8.  

3. (Rudimentary) Because Bub hears nine different answers, those answers must be exactly the nine numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  

4. (Rudimentary) Observe that one of the answers is 8, so there is a player who has already played everyone except the spouse.  

5. (Creative) Argue that the only player this 8-score player has not faced must be the player whose score is 0; therefore the 0-player and the 8-player are married.  

6. (Rudimentary) Remove that couple and the eight games of the 8-player; subtract 1 from every remaining score, leaving the multiset 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

154,"Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan live in four adjacent apartments. The apartments are set up like this:
|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.
4. If Dan lives east of Al, then Ben is the landlord and he lives in apartment 2.
Who is the landlord?","All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. If the hypothesis of such a statement is false, the whole statement is true. If the conclusion is true, the whole statement is true. However, if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, the statement is false. This means that each statement has either a false hypothesis or a true conclusion.","Reasoning:

1.  Let the apartments be numbered 1 (west) to 4 (east).  
    Each person (Al A, Ben B, Carl C, Dan D) occupies exactly one apartment.

2.  Translate the four “if … then …” statements:

    (i)  If C is NOT next to B  ⇒  A is landlord & A in #1.  
    (ii) If A is east of C      ⇒  D is landlord & D in #4.  
    (iii)If B is NOT next to D  ⇒  C is landlord & C in #3.  
    (iv) If D is east of A      ⇒  B is landlord & B in #2.

3.  Try each possible landlord.  
    • A as landlord forces
        – A west of C (to avoid (ii)),
        – B next D (to avoid (iii)),
        – D west of A (to avoid (iv)).
      Exhausting the apartment orders shows these conditions cannot all be met together with (i).  
      So A cannot be landlord.

    • B as landlord forces
        – A west of C (to avoid (ii)),
        – B next D and C next B (to avoid (iii) and (i)),
        – D not east of A (to avoid (iv) unless B is in #2).  
      No assignment satisfies everything, so B cannot be landlord.

    • C as landlord forces
        – A west of C   (to avoid (ii)),
        – C next B      (to avoid (i)),
        – D west of A   (to avoid (iv)).  

      Place D-A-C in increasing order with C next to B:

        D  A  C  B
        1  2  3  4

      Check all rules:
        (i) C is next to B → antecedent false, ok.  
        (ii) A (2) east of C (3)? No → antecedent false, ok.  
        (iii) B (4) not next D (1) → antecedent true; conclusion “C landlord & C in #3” holds.  
        (iv) D (1) east of A (2)? No → antecedent false, ok.

      All conditions satisfied, so this arrangement works.  
      No other arrangement works for C (or for any other landlord), so the landlord must be Carl.

156,"Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","Let t be the number of (true) hours that elapse after the two clocks are set together at 12:00​ noon.

Speed of the fast clock = 1 hour + 10 s per true hour  
Speed of the slow clock = 1 hour – 10 s per true hour

Therefore the two readings separate at the rate  
(10 s + 10 s) = 20 seconds per true hour.

For the two dials to look identical again they must differ by an integral number of complete dial-cycles.  
Because a grandfather clock has a 12-hour dial, the smallest non-zero difference that makes the two readings look the same is 12 hours = 43 200 seconds.

Time needed for that difference:
t = 43 200 s ÷ 20 (s/h) = 2160 h = 2160 ÷ 24 = 90 days.

Hence the first time the dials will agree again is exactly 90 days after they were set.

We are told that this first reunion of the dials occurs on Smoe’s 47th birthday, which is “in May.”  
So the 90-day interval that starts “on a day in January” must end on a May date.

Check the calendar.

Non-leap year (February = 28 days):

Jan 31 → 31 days  
Feb → 28 days (total 59)  
Mar → 31 days (total 90)

So 90 days after 31 January is 1 May.

Any January date earlier than the 31st would land in April; any later date does not exist.  
Therefore the January day must be 31 January of a non-leap year, and Smoe’s birthday must be 1 May of that same year.

Now look at the candidate years for Smoe’s 47th birthday.

• If Smoe was born in May 1932, his 47th birthday is 1 May 1979 – a non-leap year (Feb 1979 has 28 days).  
• If Smoe was born in May 1933, his 47th birthday is 1 May 1980 – but 1980 is a leap year, so Feb 1980 has 29 days and 90 days after 31 January 1980 would be 30 April, not 1 May.

Since only the year 1979 satisfies the 90-day requirement, Smoe must have been born in May 1932.

Hence Smoe is the one who is 47 in May 1979, while Joe (born May 1933) turns 46 that year.

You have nothing else at your disposal and you can not measure using eye or shape of jugs.
Also water can only be transferred between jugs and not dumped out from any of the jugs.","Not much of a hint, but it can be solved in 20 steps.","Notation

A-contents ‑ B-contents ‑ C-contents ‑ D-contents (in litres).  
The total amount of water is 20 ℓ and never changes.

Start : (10 , 10 , 0 , 0)

The plan  
1. First manufacture exactly 5 ℓ in one 10-ℓ jug (we shall use jug C).  
   This is done by moving one litre at a time from jug B to jug C; every
   time we create that 1-litre portion we replace it immediately so that
   we can repeat the process five times.  
2. When C contains 5 ℓ we pour 9 ℓ from B to the 9-ℓ jug D; B is then
   left with the desired 1 ℓ.  
3. Finally we pour from D to C until C is full; exactly 5 ℓ move,
   leaving 4 ℓ in D and reaching the required situation.

158,"Ole Santa's pack held thirty toys
Made by his elfin crew;
And though none made the same amount,
Each elf made more than two.
The elf named Cher made one more Christmas toy
Than the elf who dressed in reds,
But Cher made one less Christmas toy
Than the elf who made the sleds.
Spry Johnny Elf made racing cars;
Five toys were made by Jane.
The elf who dressed in yellow suits
Made each and every train.
The elf who always dressed in green
Made one-third as many as Sue;
Cute Marcia elf was dressed in orange,
And one elf dressed in blue.
The elf who made the spinning tops
Made the most toys of them all.
Another perky smiling elf
Made each and every ball.
Ole Santa's pack held thirty gifts
All tagged for girls and boys.
From the clues that you've been given,
Now guess who made the toys!",This puzzle involves five elves dressed in five different colors each making a different toy. Figure out the numbers that fit these conditions and can add up to thirty!,"Numbers of toys (all different and greater than 2) that sum to 30 and satisfy  
• a consecutive triple k, k+1, k+2 for (red-elf , Cher , sled-maker) and  
• the 1 : 3 ratio (green-elf , Sue)  

are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 = 30 with  
 green = 3   Sue = 9   red = 5   Cher = 6   sled-maker = 7.

Now fit the other clues.

Elf list with deductions
1. Johnny made racing cars and must be the green elf (so 3 cars).  
2. Sue therefore made 9 spinning tops (largest total) and is the one in blue (the only unassigned colour left).  
3. Cher made 6 toys, has one more than red-elf (5) and one less than sled-elf (7); to satisfy “yellow-elf made all the trains”, Cher must be the yellow elf and the train-maker.  
4. Jane made 5 toys, so she is the red elf (5 is 1 less than Cher’s 6) and, being still without a toy, she must be the ball-maker.  
5. Marcia is left with the only remaining total (7 toys), is already stated to wear orange, and therefore is the sled-maker.

All conditions are now met:

 Johnny – green suit – 3 racing cars  
 Sue  – blue suit  – 9 spinning tops  
 Cher  – yellow suit – 6 trains  
 Jane  – red suit  – 5 balls  
 Marcia – orange suit – 7 sleds

Check: totals 3+5+6+7+9 = 30, all numbers different, Cher relations correct, green/Sue ratio 1 : 3, top-maker has most toys, etc. Every clue is satisfied.

Final answer:  
Johnny made 3 racing cars in a green suit;

You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
",??-??-66-??,"First, convert each clue into explicit restrictions:

1. Let the digits be arranged in 4 two-digit “sets’’: A₁A₂ – B₁B₂ – C₁C₂ – D₁D₂  
   Clue 1: C₁ + B₂ < 8.

2. The only digits that never appear are 5 and 7.  
   ⇒ Every digit 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 must appear at least once somewhere.

3. A₁ + A₂ ≠ 10.

4. 4 × (B₁B₂) = (D₂D₁)   (i.e. four times the 2nd set equals the 4th set reversed).

5. No two-digit set exceeds 90.

6. A₁·A₂ is between 20 and 30 exclusive of the bounds.

7. One entire set is 66.

8. There is exactly one 8 in the whole combination, and it is in the last set.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step deduction

• From (6): the only digit pairs (ignoring order) whose product is 21–29 are
  (4,6) giving 24 and (3,9) giving 27.
  – Pair (4,6) is disallowed by (3) because 4+6 = 10.
  – Therefore the first set’s digits must be 3 and 9, and by (5) the number
    cannot be 93 (>90).  
    ⇒ First set = 39.

• Clue 7 says one set is 66.  
  It cannot be the 4th set (because that would contain no 8), nor the 2nd set
  (because of clue 4; 4·66 is three-digit).  
  ⇒ Third set = 66.

• Using clue 1: C₁ = 6 (from 66).  So 6 + B₂ < 8 ⇒ B₂ must be 1.
  ⇒ The second set is ?1.

• By (5) and the multiplication in clue 4, the 2nd set must be ≤24 (since
  25×4 already gives 100).  With B₂ = 1 only two choices exist: 11 or 21.

   – If 2nd set = 11, then 4×11 = 44, hence the 4th set reversed is 44 and
     the 4th set itself is 44.  But the 4th set must contain the only 8.
     ⇒ 11 impossible.

   – Therefore 2nd set = 21.  
     Clue 4 then gives 4×21 = 84, so the reversed 4th set is 84 and the 4th
     set itself is 48, which indeed contains exactly one 8.

• Collect all digits now present:
  39 – 21 – 66 – 48  uses 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 exactly once each; 5 and 7 are absent.
  Every clue is satisfied, and no set exceeds 90.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Use clue 6 (A₁·A₂ between 20 and 30) together with clue 3 (A₁+A₂ ≠ 10) to narrow the possible digit pairs to (4,6) and (3,9); eliminate (4,6) because 4+6=10, and—since a set cannot exceed 90—fix the first set as 39 rather than 93.  

2. (Creative)  Apply clue 7 (one set is 66) and exclude its placement in the 4th set (would violate the single-8 rule) and the 2nd set (would violate the “×4 then reverse’’ rule), leaving the 3rd set to be 66.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Use clue 1 with C₁ = 6 (from 66): 6 + B₂ < 8 ⇒ B₂ = 1, so the second set is ?1.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Combine clue 5 (no set > 90) and the ×4 relation of clue 4 to see the 2nd set must be ≤24; with B₂ = 1 this leaves only 11 or 21 as possibilities.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Test the option 11: 4×11 = 44 makes the 4th set 44, contradicting clue 8 (the 4th set must contain the only 8); therefore discard 11.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Adopt the remaining option 21; apply clue 4: 4×21 = 84, so the reversed 4th set is 84, making the actual 4th set 48, which indeed contains exactly one 8.

160,"A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Strategy (decided before the hats are put on)  
1. Every prisoner will look at the OTHER prisoners and count how many white hats he sees.  
2. If that number is even he will say “black.”  
3. If that number is odd he will say “white.”

Why the strategy works  
Let T be the total number of white hats actually on all heads.

Case 1 – T is even.  
• A prisoner wearing a black hat sees T white hats (still even) → he says “black” → correct.  
• A prisoner wearing a white hat sees T–1 white hats (odd) → he says “white” → correct.  
Hence everyone is correct.

Case 2 – T is odd.  
• A prisoner wearing a black hat sees T white hats (odd) → he says “white” → wrong.  
• A prisoner wearing a white hat sees T–1 white hats (even) → he says “black” → wrong.  
Hence everyone is wrong.

So, no matter how the warden distributes the hats, the prisoners’ answers are either all right (if the total number of white hats is even) or all wrong (if it is odd). Therefore the whole group is guaranteed to go free.

Final answer: Each prisoner counts the number of white hats he sees; if the count is even he guesses “black,” if it is odd he guesses “white.” This forces everyone to be simultaneously correct when the total number of white hats is even, and simultaneously mistaken when it is odd, so they always meet the warden’s requirement and escape.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

There is a huge fight that doesn't stop until the driver speaks to them again and suggests a way of selecting the passengers who are to get off the bus.

On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change. ","Number the jack-o’-lanterns 1,2,…,7 round the circle and let  

xi = 0  if you never blow on lantern i,
xi = 1  if you blow on lantern i once  
(two blows on the same lantern cancel, so 0/1 is enough).

Every time you blow on i the lanterns i–1, i, i+1 (indices taken mod 7) all change
their state.  Working modulo 2 (“lit” = 1, “out” = 0) and starting from the
all-lit vector (1,1,1,1,1,1,1), the final state will be

(1,1,1,1,1,1,1) + M x,

where M is the 7 × 7 binary matrix whose (i,j) entry is 1 when j = i, i±1
(mod 7) and 0 otherwise.  We need the final state to be (0,0,0,0,0,0,0), so

M x = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).                                             (★)

Writing the seven equations in (★):

x7 + x1 + x2 = 1  
x1 + x2 + x3 = 1  
x2 + x3 + x4 = 1  
x3 + x4 + x5 = 1  
x4 + x5 + x6 = 1  
x5 + x6 + x7 = 1  
x6 + x7 + x1 = 1  (indices mod 7).

Add all seven equations.  Each xi appears exactly three times, and 3 ≡ 1 (mod 2),
so the left side is Σ xi.  The right side is 7 ≡ 1 (mod 2).  Hence

Σ xi = 1 (mod 2);            (1)

an odd number of lanterns must be blown on.

To solve (★) completely, start with the first two equations:

x7 = x3, x1 = x3, so x1 = x3 = x7.      (2)

Using (2) in the next pair gives x2 = x6, and using that in the next gives
x4 = x1.  Substituting these relations into any one of the original equations
yields

x1 = 1.

But then every variable equals x1, so

x1 = x2 = … = x7 = 1.                     (3)

Thus the UNIQUE solution of (★) is

x = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).

Because the solution is unique and uses all seven 1’s, two important facts follow:

• One must blow on every single lantern.  
• Seven blows are the minimum possible; any smaller (odd) number cannot satisfy (★).

Therefore the procedure is simple:

Start anywhere and blow once on each of the seven jack-o’-lanterns (in any order; order does not matter).  After the seventh blow all three togglings
on every lantern have accumulated exactly once, cancelling the initial “lit”
state and leaving every lantern dark.

Final answer: blow on each of the seven lanterns exactly once – that alone, and nothing less, extinguishes them all.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

164,"Every day from Monday through Sunday in this week, Mr. Peter picks two shirts from the five colours red, blue, yellow, green and black. Peter follows the rules:
1. Peter doesn't use the same combination on two days of this week.
2. Peter doesn't use the same colour on two consecutive days of this week.
3. Peter uses some colour on four days.
4. Peter uses blue and black on Monday.
5. Peter uses green on Thursday.
6. Peter doesn't use yellow on Friday.
7. Peter doesn't combine red with black.
What colours does Peter use on Saturday?",Start from rules 2 and 3,"Step 1.  Which colour is the one that is worn on four days?  
Because the colour cannot be worn on two consecutive days, a colour that occurs four times in a seven-day week must be worn on every other day, i.e. on the four days  

  Mon – Wed – Fri – Sun.  

Since Monday’s combination is fixed as (Blue, Black), the “four-day” colour can only be Blue or Black.

•  Suppose it were Black.  
 Black would then have to be worn on Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun.  
 Friday would therefore have to contain Black, but  
  – Friday may not contain Yellow (rule 6),  
  – it may not contain Blue or Green (Wednesday’s colours, rule 2),  
  – it may not contain Red (rule 7, no Red with Black).  
 No colour is left to pair with Black on Friday – impossible.  
Hence Black cannot be the four-day colour.

Therefore Blue is the colour worn on four days: Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun.

Step 2.  Construct the combinations day by day.

Monday (given)  :  B + K.

Tuesday (avoid B, K) : choose R + G.  (any pair of {R,G,Y} would do; we pick R G.)

Wednesday (avoid R, G; must contain B)  
 Possible partners for Blue are Y or K.  
 B + K duplicates Monday, so take B + Y.

Thursday (given G; avoid B, Y)  
 Choices with G are K or R.  
 Taking G + K keeps later options open.

Friday (avoid G, K; must contain B; no Yellow)  
 Only colour available to pair with B is R ⇒ B + R.

Saturday (avoid B, R)  
 The unused, admissible pairs are {G,Y}, {Y,K}.  
 If Saturday were G + Y, then Sunday (which must contain B) could be neither B + K (duplicate) nor B + R (duplicate) nor B + Y/B + G (share a colour with Sat) – impossible.  
 Hence Saturday must be Y + K.

Sunday (avoid Y, K; must contain B; use unused pair)  
 B + G is the only remaining possible and unused combination.

Step 3.  Verify all requirements.

Mon  B K  
Tue  R G  
Wed  B Y  
Thu  G K  
Fri  B R  
Sat  K Y  
Sun B G  

• All seven combinations are different.  
• No colour appears on two consecutive days.  
• Blue appears on Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun – exactly four days.  
• Rule 4, 5, 6, 7 are all satisfied (Yellow not on Fri, no Red-Black pair, etc.).

Everything is consistent, and Saturday’s colours are uniquely determined.

165,"At the Christmas party of the ""Sweaty Chef"" kebab shop, the owner Mr Juan, took note of how many people were present. Although he was a bit tipsy when he made his note, and thus made a mistake.  His notes were as follows:-
1, There were 9 men and children.
2, There were 2 more women than children.
3, The number of different man-woman couples possible was 24. Note that if there were 7 men and 5 women, then there would have been 35 man-woman couples possible.
Also, of the three groups - men, women and children - at the party:
4, There were 4 of one group.
5, There were 6 of one group.
6, There were 8 of one group.
Exactly one of the above 6 statements is false.
Can you tell which one is false? Also, how many men, women and children are there at the party?","Can 4,5,6 all be true at the same time?","Let  

M = number of men  
W = number of women  
C = number of children  

Translating the six notes:

1) M + C = 9  
2) W = C + 2  
3) M × W = 24  
4) At least one of the three groups has size 4  
5) At least one of the three groups has size 6  
6) At least one of the three groups has size 8  

Exactly one of the six statements is wrong.

Step 1 – Use the numerical equalities.

From (2): W = C + 2.  
Insert C = 9 − M from (1) to get W = 11 − M.  
Put this into (3):

 M · (11 − M) = 24  
 ⇒ M² – 11M + 24 = 0  
 ⇒ (M − 8)(M − 3) = 0  
 ⇒ M = 8 or M = 3.

This gives two candidate groups:

 a) M = 8, C = 1, W = 3  
 b) M = 3, C = 6, W = 8.

Step 2 – Decide which size statements (4-6) are true.

Because only one of the six notes is false, we test each possibility.

• Suppose note 4 is the false one (no group of size 4).  
  For candidate a) the sizes {8,1,3} contain no 6 or 4, breaking two notes—discard.  
  For candidate b) the sizes are {3,6,8}.  
 – Size 4 is absent → note 4 is indeed false.  
 – Size 6 is present → note 5 true.  
 – Size 8 is present → note 6 true.  
  Thus with candidate b) exactly one note (note 4) is false and all others are true.

• If instead note 5 or note 6 were the false one, we would need the sizes {4,8,x} or {4,6,x}.  Neither candidate set of sizes satisfies those requirements, so those alternatives fail.

Hence the only consistent arrangement is the second candidate with note 4 being the lone error.

Men M = 3  
Women W = 8  
Children C = 6  

Check:  
1) 3 + 6 = 9 ✔  
2) 8 = 6 + 2 ✔  
3) 3·8 = 24 ✔  
4) No group of size 4 ✖ (false)  
5) One group of size 6 ✔  
6) One group of size 8 ✔

168,"I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.","First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","We start with 5 cards each and I serve in round 1.  
Notation: W = I win the round, L = I lose the round.

Card-change rules  
• If I serve: win → +2, lose → –1  
• If I receive: win → +1, lose → –2  
The winner of a round serves the next round.

Round-by-round enumeration (my running card total in parentheses).

1. I serve.

a) Round 1 = W: cards 5 → 7, I serve R2.  
   – R2 = W: cards 7 → 9, I serve R3.  
       • R3 = W ⇒ 11 (≠4)  
       • R3 = L ⇒ 8  (≠4)  
   – R2 = L: cards 7 → 6, I receive R3.  
       • R3 = W ⇒ 7  (≠4)  
       • R3 = L ⇒ 4  (OK)  → sequence W L L

b) Round 1 = L: cards 5 → 4, I receive R2.  
   – R2 = W: cards 4 → 5, I serve R3.  
       • R3 = W ⇒ 7  (≠4)  
       • R3 = L ⇒ 4  (OK)  → sequence L W L  
   – R2 = L: cards 4 → 2, I receive R3.  
       • R3 = W ⇒ 3  (≠4)  
       • R3 = L ⇒ 0  (game would end)

Thus the only possible three-round histories that leave me with exactly 4 cards are

1) W L L   2) L W L

In both:
• Tweeto wins exactly two rounds.  
• Tweeto wins the third round.  
• I do not necessarily win the first round (I do in 1, not in 2).

169,"Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?",,"Reasoning steps  

1. Phil is “sitting in his bedroom” merely watching what is happening; he is not wading around in six-foot-deep water himself.  
2. The description of Madadia is absurdly comic: people “harvest” kebabs, and an entire “kebab harvest” is said to be washed away. Kebabs aren’t something that grow and are harvested, so the text is clearly describing a make-believe world.  
3. Because every detail is exaggerated and impossible, the easiest explanation is that Madadia exists only inside something Phil is looking at – e.g. a computer or TV screen.  
4. Phil’s excitement therefore concerns a fictional, simulated town that he has made or is watching; nothing real is in danger.  
5. Norma realises this. Since the disaster is happening only in Phil’s game (or programme) and not in the real world, she “could really care less” and refuses to take the discussion seriously.

171,"In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.

M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.
While others jostled to ask the next question, one logically minded newshound was already leaving with the hot headline news.

S : “The announcement concerns subsidies.”

Enumerate the six possible single-item decisions that the government could announce (one increase or decrease in wages, subsidies or taxes) and see how each decision makes the three statements true or false.

172,There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?,"By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","To analyze the game, note the following classic fact for “take-away” games:

• If on every turn a player may remove any number of objects from 1 up to M (here M = 100),  
  then the positions that are losing for the player whose turn it is are exactly the multiples of (M+1).

Reason:  
– From a multiple of (M+1) every legal move (removing k, 1 ≤ k ≤ M) leaves a pile of size  
  (M+1)·q – k = (M+1)(q–1) + [(M+1) – k], which is NOT a multiple of (M+1).  
– Conversely, from any non-multiple, a player can move to a multiple by removing exactly the remainder r (1 ≤ r ≤ M) when the pile is divided by (M+1).  
  Thereafter, whatever the opponent takes (k), you respond with (M+1) – k, restoring a multiple.  
  Eventually you take the last object(s) and win.

In this problem M = 100, so the critical modulus is 101.

Compute 2008 modulo 101:  
101 × 19 = 1919  
2008 – 1919 = 89.

Since 89 ≠ 0, the initial position is winning.  
The winning first move is to remove exactly the remainder, 89 eggs, leaving 2008 – 89 = 1919 eggs, which is 19 × 101, a multiple of 101.  
After that, whatever number k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) the opponent removes, you always remove 101 – k, keeping a multiple of 101 after each of your turns and ensuring you take the final egg(s).

Three travelers, Al, Ben and Carl, came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote five three-letter words on a rock. The five words were HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
Then the troll asked Al, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Al, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Ben, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Ben, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Carl, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Carl, and the troll let him pass.
So, what is the password?","1. Ben used Al's answer, and Carl used both Al's and Ben's answers.
2. Al's letter could not have been E.","Reasoning in full:

1.  The password is one of the five words
        HOE OAR PAD TOE VAT  
    and its three different letters are given one‐apiece to Al, Ben and Carl.

2.  Al is questioned first and is able to identify the password immediately, using
    only the single letter he received.
    •  That is possible only if his letter occurs in exactly ONE of the five words.  
       (If his letter appeared in two or more words, he could not distinguish
       which of those words was the password.)
    •  The letters that occur in only one word are
             D  (only in PAD)
             H  (only in HOE)
             P  (only in PAD)
             R  (only in OAR)
             V  (only in VAT)

    Hence Al must have received one of {D, H, P, R, V}, and the password
    must be a word that contains such a letter.  
    Therefore TOE is immediately ruled out (it has no unique letter).

3.  Ben now knows
        • his own letter, and
        • the fact that Al could tell the password from a unique letter.
    Ben, too, succeeds at once.  Check each of the remaining candidate words.

    a)  OAR  
        If OAR were the password, Al’s unique letter would be R, leaving
        O and A for Ben or Carl.  
        –  If Ben had O, the words HOE and OAR would both still be possible  
          (each contains a unique letter for Al), so Ben could **not** decide.  
        –  If Ben had A, the words OAR, PAD and VAT would still be possible.  
          Again he could **not** decide.  
        Hence OAR cannot be the password.

    b)  PAD  
        Al’s unique letter would have to be P or D.  
        –  If Ben received the non-unique A he could not decide.  
        –  If Ben received the other unique letter (D or P) he could decide,  
          but then Carl would be left with A and would **not** be able to
          decide in the next step.  
        So PAD is impossible.

    c)  VAT  
        Al’s unique letter would be V, leaving A and T.  
        –  For Ben to succeed he must get T (with T he can rule out TOE, leaving only VAT).  
        –  Carl would then hold the non-unique A; with A he would still see PAD
          and VAT as possibilities and could **not** decide.  
        So VAT is impossible.

    d)  HOE  
        Al’s unique letter must be H.  
        Suppose Ben gets E and Carl gets O.  
        –  Ben’s letter E appears in HOE and TOE.  
          But TOE has no unique letter for Al, so Ben rules TOE out and
          knows the password is HOE.  
        –  Carl hears that both Al and Ben have succeeded.  
          Holding O, he initially considers HOE, OAR and TOE.  
          TOE is impossible (no unique letter for Al);  
          OAR is impossible because, as shown before, Ben could not have
          decided with either O or A.  
          Thus only HOE remains, and Carl also knows the password.

        This distribution (Al = H, Ben = E, Carl = O) lets all three travellers
        deduce the word exactly as the story relates.

4.  No other word allows the three “Yes” answers in sequence; HOE is the
    unique solution.

1.  Translate the statement of the puzzle into four independent letter–choice lists:

   • First letter (@) can be A, G, P, E, Y  
   • Second letter (!) can be R, U, O, N, V  
   • Third letter (;) can be O, M, I, C, S  
   • Fourth letter (?) can be U, D, L, W, J  

2.  Because each symbol can stand for any one of five letters, a single coded form “@!;?” actually represents 5⁴ = 625 possible four-letter letter strings.

3.  The puzzle asks for two of those possible strings that
   (a) spell real English words, and  
   (b) are antonyms (opposites).

4.  Look for familiar four-letter antonym pairs and test them against the allowed letters in each position.

Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  Notation  
   C = club, D = diamond, H = heart, S = spade  
   Hands  
   John : C H D  Paul : C S S  George : C H H  Ringo : S D D  

2.  Facts that must hold in every trick  
   • Leading suit ≠ high suit (otherwise more than one high-suit card would be forced to appear).  
   • Exactly two players possess the leading suit; they supply the two cards of that suit.  
   • Of the remaining two players, the ones that still hold a card of the high suit are forced to play it, so exactly one of those two players may still have a high-suit card.  

3.  Try each suit as the high suit.

   High suit = Clubs  
   – At the start John, Paul, George all have a club.  
   – Whatever the first leading suit is (H, D or S), at least two of the three club-holders will lack it, hence two clubs must be played in the very first trick – impossible because only one high-suit card is allowed.  
   ⇒ Clubs cannot be the high suit.

   High suit = Hearts  
   – Only John and George own hearts.  
   – The only initial leading suit that gives exactly one heart among the two non-followers is D.  
   – After such a diamond trick the winner must lead the next, and the winner (John or George) would have only C and H left, forcing a club lead with three clubs in play – impossible.  
   ⇒ Hearts cannot be the high suit.

   High suit = Spades  
   – High cards are Paul-S, Paul-S, Ringo-S (two in one hand).  
   – The first trick can be led in D so that only one spade is forced, but the winner Paul would then have to lead a club (three clubs in play) or a spade (prohibited) – impossible.  
   ⇒ Spades cannot be the high suit.

   High suit = Diamonds  
   – High cards: John-D, Ringo-D, Ringo-D.  
   – Feasible play:

     Trick 1   Leader George plays H.  
               John follows H.  
               Paul cannot follow → plays high suit D?  (He has no D) → may play S.  
               Ringo cannot follow → must play D and wins.  
               (H, H, D, S)  – OK.

     Trick 2   Ringo leads S.  
               Paul follows S.  
               John cannot follow → plays high suit D and wins.  
               George cannot follow and has no D → plays C.  
               (S, S, D, C)  – OK.

     Trick 3   John leads C.  
               Paul follows C.  
               George cannot follow → plays remaining H.  
               Ringo cannot follow → plays his remaining high D and wins.  
               (C, C, H, D)  – OK.

     Each trick contains: two leading-suit cards, exactly one diamond, exactly one other card; the winner always leads next.  All rules are obeyed.

   ⇒ Diamonds can be the high suit, and all other possibilities are impossible.

4.  Therefore the unique possible high suit is Diamonds.

181,"Mad Ade sat at home, waiting for his favourite TV program ""I'm a celebrity, Get me a Kebab"" to start. He glanced at his clock and began to wonder strange and wondrous things, but that is another story altogether.
He realised that he could leave 6 adjacent numbers of the face of a clock intact and rearrange the other 6 in such a way that the sum of every pair of adjacent numbers is prime.
Unfortunately the TV program started at that point so he never actually got around to doing it. Can you find the two possible solutions to Mad Ade's clock teaser?",Part of it is making sure each number is odd...,"Reasoning

1.  Which 6 numbers can stay where they are?  
   The six fixed numbers have to be six consecutive ones on the ordinary clock-face.
   Inside that fixed block every pair of neighbours must add to a prime, i.e. every
   consecutive pair n,(n+1) must make  
      n+(n+1)=2n+1   a prime.  
   Trying every possible block of length six, only

        11 , 12 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4

   works, because their consecutive sums are  
        11+12=23, 12+1=13, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7 (all prime).  
   Therefore the positions 11,12,1,2,3,4 remain unchanged.

2.  What has to be done with the other six positions?  
   The vacant positions 5–10 must receive the six loose numbers
        5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10
   so that every neighbouring pair round the whole circle sums to a prime.  
   Because the first fixed part ends with 4 and the second fixed part starts with 11,
   we have to find a prime-sum path

        4 – a – b – c – d – e – f – 11

   that uses each of {5,6,7,8,9,10} exactly once.  
   In the “prime-sum” graph (two numbers are adjacent if their sum is
   3,5,7,11,13,17,19 or 23) this becomes a Hamilton path problem on

        {4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}     with 4 as start and 11 as finish.

   A short hand search (see table below) shows that there are exactly two such paths:

        4 – 7 – 10 – 9 – 8 – 5 – 6 – 11
        4 – 9 – 10 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 8 – 11

   (All consecutive sums are 11,17,19,17,13,11,17 respectively and therefore prime.)

3.  Writing the two complete clock faces.  
   Keeping 11,12,1,2,3,4 fixed and inserting the two paths gives

   Solution 1 (clockwise) :  
        12 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 5 , 6 , 11

   Solution 2 (clockwise) :  
        12 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 10 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 8 , 11

   Checking once round the rim confirms that every pair of neighbours indeed has
   a prime total for both arrangements.

Final answer: the only two possible rearrangements are  

  (i) 12-1-2-3-4-7-10-9-8-5-6-11   (clockwise round the face)

M sits on the left side of the banker. M sits next to C. C sits 4 places to the left of L. L sits next to O and rarely talks to S, E or Z, because they hate him and because they sit on the far right of the bank. O does not sit next to the owner of the bank. The two people left are F and T. T hates the owner of the bank and is considering resigning. Give the names of all the bankers from left to right.",Think from the banker's point of view and draw a diagram.,"Reasoning

1.  Let the ten chairs be numbered 1 (left-most) to 10 (right-most).

2.  “The owner of the bank sits next to M, and M sits on the left side of the banker.”
    Hence we have the block   C  M  B   with B (the owner) immediately to the right of M.

3.  “M sits next to C”, so C must be immediately to M’s left: the block is C–M–B.

4.  “C sits 4 places to the left of L.”  
    Therefore L is two seats to the right of B:
       seat(L) = seat(C)+4   ⇒   seat(L) = seat(B)+2.

5.  “L sits next to O” and “O does not sit next to the owner.”  
    The only way to satisfy both is to put O on L’s right, i.e. O two seats away from B.

6.  Trying to place the block
       C  M  B  ( ? )  L  O

7.  Seats 8, 9, 10 must be S, E, Z (“they sit on the far right of the bank”).

8.  The only two people still unseated are F and T; they must go into seats 4 and 7.  
    T “hates the owner”, so we put T away from the owner (seat 7) and F in seat 4.

9.  One possible order for the right-hand trio is S E Z; any permutation of these three
    keeps them “on the far right”, so the exact internal order is irrelevant.

183,"You and your spouse invite four other couples to a party. During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present. Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?",Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.,"Give every guest two numbers :

• n (P)  = “how many of the other eight guests P was already acquainted with (the spouse not being counted)”;  
• s (P)  = “the same number but including the spouse”.

Because a person does not count himself and does not count his (already–known) spouse, n (P) can be any integer from 0 to 8, while s (P)=n (P)+1 runs from 1 to 9.

During the party the nine people other than you report nine different values for n; hence the set of values must be  
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.                                                (1)

Step 1.  Extremes are married  
If a guest A has n(A)=0 he knows none of the eight “strangers”.  
If another guest B has n(B)=8 he knows all of those eight strangers.  
Therefore B certainly knows A, so A’s only possible acquaintance is B, i.e. A and B are spouses.  
Thus the couple (0, 8) is removed from further consideration.

Step 2.  Repeat the argument  
Remove that couple from the list and look at the remaining seven numbers.  
Exactly the same reasoning shows that the guests whose remaining extreme numbers are 1 and 7 must be married, the guests with 2 and 6 must be married, and the guests with 3 and 5 must be married.

After those four couples are paired off the only unpaired number left from (1) is  

  4.

Step 3.  Who can be the “4”?  
All four other couples have already been identified, so the guest whose n–value is 4 can only be your own spouse.

Step 4.  Your own number  
Your spouse is already acquainted with you.  Consequently you are acquainted with your spouse and with exactly the same four strangers, so

  n( spouse ) = 4  and  n( you ) = 4.

Step 5.  Convert back to s-numbers (include the spouse)  
Adding the spouse to the count gives

   Jenny: J + E + 2N + Y = 19               (3)

2.  Subtract (1) from (2) and (3):

        U – A = 1  ⇒ U = A + 1            (4)  
        (3) – (1): N + Y – A = 3 ⇒ Y = A + 3 – N (5)

3.  “June is in her prime.”  
    Interpreting the pun, take every letter in JUNE to be a prime number.  
    So J, U, N, E are distinct primes whose sum is 17.  
    The only set of four different primes with this property is

        {2, 3, 5, 7}  because 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

4.  Decide which of those primes is U.  
    From (4) we need A = U – 1, and A must differ from all primes.

       U = 2 ⇒ A = 1  (but then only three primes are left – impossible)  
       U = 3 ⇒ A = 2  (A duplicates a prime – impossible)  
       U = 5 ⇒ A = 4  (fails because Y would clash or be zero)  
       U = 7 ⇒ A = 6  ✓  works.

   Hence U = 7 and A = 6.

5.  Fix N using (5).  
    With A = 6 we have Y = 9 – N.  
    To keep Y positive and distinct we need N = 5 (the only remaining prime).  
    Then Y = 9 – 5 = 4.

6.  Determine J and E.  
    The two unused primes are 2 and 3, and from (1)

        J + E = 16 – A – N = 16 – 6 – 5 = 5.

    Indeed 2 + 3 = 5, so J and E are 2 and 3 in either order.

7.  All six letters now have distinct non–zero integers:

        J   U   N   E   A   Y

       3   7   5   2   6   4

Both assignments satisfy every age equation, and no other choice does.

Final answer:  
1) J = 2, U = 7, N = 5, E = 3, A = 6, Y = 4

186,"Some office workers were holding a daily pool on the number of doughnuts their boss would eat each weekday morning during March. Each person set aside funds in their desk with which to bet. Each day from Monday, March 3rd, they all bet a dollar - Kevin bet on 2, Kate on 3 and Kathy on 3.5 doughnuts. Kathy won twice as many times as Kevin, who was right once more than Kate; sometimes there was no winner. By April, they all had $20 in their desks. How much was the most anyone could have had in their desk at the beginning of March?","The pot does not accumulate if there is no winner - each person gets his ""stake"" back.","Step 1 –  How many betting days were there?  
March 1 was a Saturday, so the first weekday was Monday, March 3.  
Weekdays from March 3 through March 31 (inclusive) are

5 days each in the weeks of the 3rd, 10th, 17th and 24th,  
plus Monday the 31st: 4·5+1 = 21 days.

So there were 21 one–dollar bets by each person.

Step 2 –  How many times did each person win?  
Let Kevin’s number of wins be k.  
Then Kate won k–1 times (“Kevin was right once more than Kate”) and  
Kathy won 2k times (“Kathy won twice as many times as Kevin”).

Only one of the three numbers 2, 3 and 3½ can be correct on any day, so at most one
person can win on a given day.  Hence

k + (k–1) + 2k = 4k – 1 ≤ 21  ⇒  k ≤ 5.

Thus k can be 1,2,3,4 or 5.

Step 3 –  Net gain or loss for one player in the month  
Every day a player puts $1 into the pool, so over 21 days he/she is –$21.  
Each time that player wins, he/she receives the whole $3 pool.
If a player wins w times, the month’s net change for that player is

Δ = –21 + 3w. (1)

Step 4 –  The starting amounts in terms of k  
Everybody finished with $20, so Starting amount = 20 – Δ.

Kevin: w = k  → S_Kevin = 20 – ( –21 + 3k ) = 41 – 3k  
Kate:  w = k–1 → S_Kate  = 20 – ( –21 + 3(k–1) ) = 44 – 3k  
Kathy: w = 2k → S_Kathy = 20 – ( –21 + 6k )      = 41 – 6k.  (2)

Step 5 –  Which choice of k gives the largest starting amount for anybody?  
Insert k = 1,2,3,4,5 into (2):

k  = 1 :  S_Kevin = 38,  S_Kate = 41,  S_Kathy = 35   →  maximum 41  
k  = 2 :  35, 38, 29   →  maximum 38  
k  = 3 :  32, 35, 23   →  maximum 35  
k  = 4 :  29, 32, 17   →  maximum 32  
k  = 5 :  26, 29, 11   →  maximum 29.

The greatest possible initial stash is $41, attained when k = 1; i.e.  
Kevin is right once, Kate never wins, and Kathy wins twice.

Step 6 –  Feasibility  
With k = 1 there are 18 days with no winner; on those days
each bettor simply loses $1, so nobody ever needs more cash than was
computed, and all three balances stay non-negative throughout the month.

Hence $41 is achievable and no larger amount is possible.

187,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.
Morris the Daft:
A) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.
B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.
Robby O'Mental:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.
Considering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?","For each person, assume they did it. Count how many truthful statements there are?","Let  

D = the guard who was on duty (and therefore the one who left the door open).  
There are four possibilities: D ∈ {Norris, Nobby, Morris, Robby}.

Each guard made two statements; altogether eight statements were made.
Exactly three of them are true and five are false.

Write the eight statements symbolically, remembering that D is the door-opener.

Norris
  A. ¬(D = Norris)            (1)
  B.    D = Morris            (2)

Nobby
  A. ¬(D = Nobby)             (3)
  B.    D = Norris            (4)

Morris
  A.    D = Nobby             (5)
  B.  “I hoped Torks would escape.”   (6)

Robby
  A. ¬(D = Robby)             (7)
  B.  “I was not surprised that Torks did not flee.”   (8)

One fact the story gives us:  
“All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would
facilitate his escape.”  
Hence Morris’s statement (6) is certainly true.

The truth of Robby’s personal reaction (8) is not fixed by the story;
call it S (true or false as needed).

Now test each possible guard on duty.

Case 1. D = Norris  
True statements: (3), (4), (7)  → already 3 truths  
But (6) must also be true, giving 4 truths.  Impossible.

Case 2. D = Nobby  
True statements: (1), (5), (7)  → already 3 truths  
Again (6) is true, giving 4 truths.  Impossible.

Case 3. D = Morris  
True statements: (1), (2), (3), (7), and (6) → at least 5 truths.  Impossible.

Case 4. D = Robby  
Evaluate:

(1) true       (¬D=Norris)  
(2) false      (D=Morris)  
(3) true       (¬D=Nobby)  
(4) false      (D=Norris)  
(5) false      (D=Nobby)  
(6) true       (given fact)  
(7) false      (¬D=Robby)  
(8) S          (unknown)

So far we have exactly three true statements: (1), (3), (6).  
To keep the total number of true statements at three, (8) must be false.  
That gives 3 true and 5 false—just what the problem requires.

Therefore the only consistent scenario is Case 4:

The guard on duty (and the one who left the door open) was Robby O’Mental.

John: ""It was Pete or Tom.""
Pete: ""It was neither George nor me.""
Tom: ""Both of you are lying.""
Steve: ""No, only one of them is lying.""
George: ""No, Steve, you are wrong.""
Then their mother added: ""Three of my sons are telling the truth, but I do not believe what the two others said.""
Who broke the window?","If you find it difficult to use logic alone, then use trial and error by assuming each one of the five sons broke the window, and list whether they are telling a lie or the truth.","Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Let C be the boy who actually broke the window.  
    We must evaluate the five statements and ensure that exactly three are true, as the mother said.

2.  Translate each boy’s statement into logic.

    John (J): C = Pete or C = Tom.  
    Pete (P): C ≠ George and C ≠ Pete.  
    Tom (T): John is lying and Pete is lying.  
    Steve (S): Exactly one of John and Pete is lying (J XOR P).  
    George (G): Steve is wrong (¬S).

3.  Note the immediate relation between Steve and George:  
    G is true ⇔ S is false, and vice-versa, so exactly one of {S,G} is true.

4.  Case analysis.

    • Suppose Steve is true and George false.  
      Then exactly one of John or Pete is true, and we still need two more truths among
      {J,P,T}.  For that to happen Tom would have to be true, but if Tom is true then
      both John and Pete are lying, contradicting “exactly one.”  Impossible.  
      ⇒ Steve cannot be telling the truth.

    • Therefore Steve is false and George is true.  
      With one truth accounted for (George), we need exactly two more truths among
      {John, Pete, Tom}.  
      Since Steve is false, J and P have the same truth value (both true or both false).

        – If both J and P were false we would need Tom true to reach 2 truths, but Tom’s
          statement “John and Pete are lying” would then be true, contradicting that J and P
          are both false.  Impossible.

        – Therefore J and P are both true and Tom is false.

5.  Determine the culprit.

    John’s true statement ⇒ C = Pete or C = Tom.  
    Pete’s true statement ⇒ C ≠ George and C ≠ Pete.  
    Combining these, C must be Tom.

6.  Verification.

    • John: “Pete or Tom.”  (Tom) – True  
    • Pete: “Not George, not me.”  (Tom) – True  
    • Tom: “Both of you are lying.”  (John & Pete truthful) – False  
    • Steve: “Exactly one of them is lying.”  (Both truthful) – False  
    • George: “Steve, you are wrong.”  (Steve false) – True

190,I have 3 dads and 4 sisters. My immediate family (living in my house) consists of 7. Two of my sisters only have 2 dads. How is this possible?,My nephew lives with me and I'm the middle child.,"Think of an ordinary modern-day “blended” family that was created after several divorces and remarriages.  
Label the adults (in the order in which they married the children’s mother) and the children like this:

Dad 1 – mum’s first husband  
  • They have one child together: the narrator (“me”).

Dad 2 – mum’s second husband  
  • They have two girls together: Sister 1 and Sister 2.  
  • While he is married to mum he is, of course, a step-father to the narrator.

Dad 3 – mum’s third (present) husband  
  • They have two more girls together: Sister 3 and Sister 4.  
  • Living with mum now, he is also step-father to the narrator and to Sisters 1 and 2.

Now count fathers (“dads”) for each child.

• The narrator has three dads  
  1. biological Dad 1  
  2. former step-dad (Dad 2)  
  3. present step-dad (Dad 3)

• Sisters 1 and 2 each have two dads  
  1. their biological Dad 2  
  2. their present step-dad (Dad 3)

• Sisters 3 and 4 have only one dad – their own biological Dad 3 (no former step-dad has ever been part of their lives).

Finally, who actually lives in the house right now?  
  Dad 3 + Mum + the five children = 7 people.

Thus

• I can truthfully say I have 3 dads.  
• I have 4 sisters.  
• Seven of us live together.  
• Exactly two of my sisters (the ones whose biological father is Dad 2) have only 2 dads.

All the conditions in the riddle are satisfied.

Final answer: A sequence of divorces and remarriages makes a blended family: Mum’s first husband is my biological father, her second husband became my first step-father, and her present husband is my current step-father. I therefore have three dads. Mum’s second husband is the biological father of two of my sisters, so those two girls have their own dad plus our current step-dad—only two dads—while the youngest two girls have just one dad.

Two of them are boxers; among the two boxers there is

If you can say 50, you win.  
So make sure that, after Henry speaks, you are always able to reply with 50.

How can you guarantee that?  Make sure you always land on 39, because whatever Henry says next (40-49) is between 1 and 10 higher, letting you answer 50.

Now think one step earlier: to guarantee reaching 39, be sure you always land on 28 (since Henry’s reply 29-38 is again 1–10 higher, letting you answer 39).

Continuing backward:

• Safe numbers: 50, 39 (=50-11), 28 (=39-11), 17 (=28-11), 6 (=17-11).

If you ever say one of these “safe” numbers, you can always force the next safe number, and eventually 50.  The only safe number that can be chosen legally on the very first move (must be 1–10) is 6.

196,"Walter, Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke crossed a river in a tiny rowboat. They all started on the same side of the river. They made three trips from the starting side to the destination side, and two trips from the destination side to the starting side. Here are some facts:
1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?","Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip,.","Reasoning

1.  The boat makes 5 trips (3 outward, 2 return), so there are 5 rowers in all.  
    Because there are 4 men, exactly one of them must row twice.

2.  Walter can row only when he is alone in the boat, hence only on a return
    trip.  Therefore he rows exactly one of the two return trips (otherwise he
    would have to be on the destination bank twice, which is impossible in only
    five trips).  Consequently the second return trip must be rowed by someone
    other than Walter.

3.  Xavier can row a two-man outward trip only if the passenger is Yoshi.  He
    cannot row with Walter as passenger.  Therefore if Walter is taken across
    as a passenger, the rower is either Yoshi or Zeke.

4.  Try to make someone other than Yoshi the man who rows twice and see what
    happens.

    •  Walter twice?  He would have to row both return trips, but to row the
       first return trip he must already be on the far side, which means the
       first outward trip must carry Walter as passenger.  After he rows back,
       only two outward trips and one return trip remain, so he cannot be on
       the far side again to row the second return trip.  Impossible.

    •  Xavier twice?  One of his rows must be an outward trip with Yoshi as
       passenger; his second row could be the first return trip.  After that,
       Walter is still on the starting side, and the last outward trip must
       carry Walter across.  Walter cannot row it (he cannot take a passenger),
       so Xavier would have to row a third time—contradiction.

    •  Zeke twice?  If Zeke rows the first outward trip carrying Walter, he must
       row back alone to be the second rower.  That leaves Walter on the start
       side again with only two trips left, and the same dead-end described
       above is reached.  Any other attempt likewise forces a contradiction.

    Hence Walter, Xavier, and Zeke cannot be the man who rows twice.

5.  Therefore Yoshi must be the one who rows twice, and indeed there is a
    consistent schedule in which that happens:

        1.  Xavier rows Yoshi across.         (rower X)
        2.  Yoshi rows back alone.            (rower Y)
        3.  Zeke rows Walter across.          (rower Z)
        4.  Walter rows back alone.           (rower W)
        5.  Yoshi rows Walter across.         (rower Y again)

    All four men row at least once, the rules for Walter’s and Xavier’s
    strength limitations are satisfied, and only Yoshi rows twice.

197,"There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?",How can he spread out his weight?,"Reasoning

1.  How the alarm works  
   • The wires lie straight and parallel under the carpet, 8 cm apart.  
   • If more than 4 kg is put on any ONE wire the alarm sounds.

2.  What has to be achieved  
   • Carlo (≈ 74 kg) + anything he is standing on must be supported by many different wires at the same time so that the load on each wire is < 4 kg even when all of his weight is on one foot.

   74 kg ÷ 4 kg / wire = 18.5 → at least 19 wires must share the load.  
   Spacing 8 cm → 19 wires span 18 × 8 cm = 144 cm.  
   So a “shoe” that is about 1.5 m long and is set down at right angles to the wires will rest on at least 19 wires and keep the load per wire below 4 kg.

3.  Making the “shoes”  
   • Saw the 5-metre 2 × 4 board into two equal pieces 2 m long (40 cm of board remains as scrap).  
   • Each 2 m plank is 10 cm (4″) wide and will cross ≈ 25 wires (2 m ÷ 0.08 m ≈ 25).  
     ‑ With Carlo plus the plank (≈ 84 kg altogether) on one foot, the load per wire is  
       84 kg ÷ 25 ≈ 3.4 kg < 4 kg … safe.  
   • Fix each plank to a foot with two of the leather straps (one in front of the ankle, one behind).  
     They are now 2-metre-long “snow-shoes”.

4.  Crossing the room  
   • Carlo turns the planks so they are exactly at right angles to the invisible wires.  
   • He now walks to the centre: whenever he lifts one foot all of his weight goes onto the other plank, but that plank is already resting on about 25 different wires and no single wire is overloaded.  
   • Walking is slow but perfectly possible—he simply slides each “shoe” forward instead of lifting it high so that the long plank always lies squarely across the wires.

5.  Taking the diamond  
   • At the pedestal he slides one plank right up to it, kneels on that plank, and lifts the glass cover with the loose 40 cm piece of board (or with the hammer’s claw) to avoid putting a hand on the floor.  
   • He picks up the diamond (a few hundred grams—negligible for the calculation), backs away the same way and leaves the room.

Throughout the operation no wire ever carries as much as 4 kg, so the alarm is never triggered.

Final answer: Carlo saws the 5-metre 2 × 4 into two 2-metre planks, straps one plank to each foot as 2-metre-long “snow-shoes”, and walks to and from the pedestal; each plank rests on about 25 wires so every wire carries less than 4 kg, keeping the alarm silent while he removes the diamond.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

b. If any of the three women has exactly one of the three characteristics, Mr. Froopaloop will marry the one with the greatest number of characteristics.

    B = “has blue eyes”,  
    R = “has red hair”,  
    H = “is 5′11″”.  

For each woman write a 1 if she possesses the trait, 0 otherwise.

Step 1.  Translate the statements.

1.  Audrey and Brenda  
 a) B values equal        A_B = B_B  
 b) R values opposite      A_R ≠ B_R  

2.  Audrey and Charlotte  
 a) R values equal        A_R = C_R  
 b) H values opposite      A_H ≠ C_H  

3.  Brenda and Charlotte  
 a) B values opposite      B_B ≠ C_B  
 b) H values opposite      B_H ≠ C_H  

Combining 1a with 3a gives A_B = B_B ≠ C_B.  
Combining 1b with 2a gives A_R = C_R ≠ B_R.  
From 2b and 3b we get A_H = B_H ≠ C_H.

Thus the whole pattern is determined by the three bits
 C_B  (blue–ness of Charlotte),
 C_R  (red-hair of Charlotte),
 C_H  (height of Charlotte).

Indeed

 A_B = B_B = 1 − C_B  
 A_R = C_R         B_R = 1 − C_R  
 A_H = B_H = 1 − C_H  

Step 2.  List the eight possible triples (C_B , C_R , C_H) and the
numbers of traits each woman would have.

Notation: (C , A , B) = counts of traits.

1) (0,0,0)  → (0,2,3)  
2) (0,0,1)  → (1,1,2)  
3) (0,1,0)  → (1,3,2)  
4) (0,1,1)  → (2,2,1)  
5) (1,0,0)  → (1,1,2)  
6) (1,0,1)  → (2,0,1)  
7) (1,1,0)  → (2,2,1)  
8) (1,1,1)  → (3,1,0)

Step 3.  Apply Froopaloop’s rule.

• Rule 4a (“if someone has exactly two traits, marry the one with the
least number of traits”) and Rule 4b (“if someone has exactly one trait,
marry the one with the greatest number of traits”) must not both apply
at the same time – otherwise the problem would give two contradictory
answers.

Check the eight cases:

– Cases 2,3,4,5,6,7 each contain both a “1-trait” woman and a
“2-traits” woman, so both rules would fire simultaneously; such cases
are therefore impossible.

– Case 1 has a 2-traits woman but nobody with exactly 1 trait.  
 Only Rule 4a applies ⇒ marry the woman with the fewest traits,
namely Charlotte (0 traits).

– Case 8 has a 1-trait woman but nobody with exactly 2 traits.  
 Only Rule 4b applies ⇒ marry the woman with the most traits, again
Charlotte (3 traits).

201,"Mad Ade has placed five Queens on a chessboard, such that every square including those occupied by the Queens are under attack.
Imagine the chessboard is set out with reference points 1 to 8 on the vertical and A to H across the horizontal.
At what positions would the five Queens need to be?",A couple queens next to each other can cover a lot.,"One concrete way to do it is to put the queens on  

A1 , C5 , F3 , E8 and H6.  

Why this works  

1.  Every row or column that contains a queen is obviously covered completely.  
   – Rows 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 are occupied, hence entirely attacked.  
   – Columns A, C, E, F and H are occupied, hence entirely attacked.  

2.  What remains are rows 2, 4, 7 and columns B, D, G.  
    • Row 2 :  
      A2 (col A), B2 (diagonal from A1), C2 (col C), D2 (diagonal from H6),  
      E2 (diagonal from F3), F2 (diagonal from C5), G2 (diagonal from F3),  
      H2 (col H) – all attacked.  
    • Row 4 :  
      A4 (diagonal from E8), B4 (diagonal from C5), C4 (col C), D4 (diagonal from A1),  
      E4 (col E), F4 (diagonal from H6), G4 (diagonal from F3), H4 (col H) – all attacked.  
    • Row 7 :  
      A7 (diagonal from C5), B7 (diagonal from C5), C7 (col C), D7 (diagonal from E8),  
      E7 (col E), F7 (diagonal from E8), G7 (diagonal from A1), H7 (col H) – all attacked.  

3.  The four corner squares are definitely attacked:  
    – A1 is occupied.  
    – H8 lies in column H (queen on H6).  
    – A8 lies in column A (queen on A1).  
    – H1 lies in column H (queen on H6).  

Thus every single square, including the ones where the queens stand, is either occupied by a queen or attacked by at least one queen.

The only way out is to drink one of the bottles' contents, and the liquid will cool down your body heat (with no harm to yourself) enough so that the heat sensor doesn't detect you anymore. There are nine bottles on the ground beyond the table. The content of the slip of paper will tell you what each of the bottles are. Find out what all the bottles are, and then find out which one to drink to get out.
Three of me are poison, and will kill you if you drink.
Two of me are water, nothing bad will happen with these.
Two of me are wine, and it will only get you drunk.
One will heat you up forever, and this room will never let you out. (hinder)
Only one here will help you, it will cool down your body heat.
No medium bottles are poison.
Wine is bad in large doses, so none are large.
Each of the end bottles have the same contents.
No matter how help hides, it will be on poison's left side, but its left side is safe.
No two small bottles are the same.
The hinderer is harder, for it resides between wine and water.
The hinder bottle is large, so it works forever.
Neither big nor medium will save your life.
Poison is all you will get from the bottle on the far right.
Water is next to the helper.
Bottle Order:
Large--Small--Large--Medium--Small--Large--Medium--Large--Small",Use the fact that help must be small. ,"Let us label the nine bottles 1-9 from left to right and note their sizes:

1 (L) – 2 (S) – 3 (L) – 4 (M) – 5 (S) – 6 (L) – 7 (M) – 8 (L) – 9 (S)

Key to contents:  
P = poison (3 bottles)  
W = water (2 bottles)  
V = wine  (2 bottles)  
H = hinderer (heats you) (1 bottle)  
C = cooler ‑ the helper (1 bottle)

Rules translated into logic
1. Bottles 1 and 9 are the same and rule 14 says the far-right bottle is poison ⇒ 1=9=P.  
2. There are exactly 3 poisons, so only one other P remains.  
3. “Neither big nor medium will save your life” ⇒ the helper C is small ⇒ C is bottle 2 or 5 (the only small bottles not already P).  
4. “No matter how help hides, it will be on poison’s left side” ⇒ C is immediately left of a P, and the bottle to C’s left is not poison.  
 • If C were bottle 2, bottle 3 would be P but then one neighbour of C must be water (rule “Water is next to the helper”).  Bottle 1 is already P, so impossible.  
 • Therefore C is bottle 5, and bottle 6 is the third (and last) poison. Bottle 4, the other neighbour of C, must be water.  
5. No medium bottle is poison ⇒ bottles 4 and 7 cannot be P (consistent).  
6. “Wine is bad in large doses, so none are large” ⇒ bottles 1,3,6,8 cannot be wine.  
7. “The hinderer… resides between wine and water” and “The hinder bottle is large” ⇒ some large bottle whose two immediate neighbours are wine and water is H.  

 Candidates for a large bottle with two neighbours: 3 and 6.  
 • Bottle 6’s neighbours are 5(C) and 7(M) – not wine & water.  
 • Bottle 3’s neighbours are 2(S) and 4(M).  We already have 4=W, so if 3 is H then 2 must be wine.  This fits every rule.

Thus: 2=V, 3=H, 4=W.

8. Counts so far  
P: 1,6,9  W: 4  V: 2  H: 3  C: 5  
We still need one more W and one more V, and bottles left undecided are 7(M) and 8(L).

 • Bottle 8 is large and cannot be wine ⇒ 8=W.  
 • Bottle 7 (medium, not poison) becomes the remaining wine ⇒ 7=V.

203,"You have the following equations:
a + c = a
b - c = c
c / b = c
a * a = b
You also know that a, b, c have the values 0, 1 and 2, but not necessarily in that order.
But to make matters more complicated the symbols + - * / have been mixed up: all you know is that each represents a different arithmetical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division).
Can you work out the values of a, b and c, and what each of the symbols actually mean?",The only thing you should assume about the arithmetical symbols is that no two represent the same operation.,"Step 1.  Give names to the real operations  
Let  
⊕ = ordinary addition  
⊖ = ordinary subtraction  
⊗ = ordinary multiplication  
⊘ = ordinary division  

The four printed symbols ‘+ – * /’ are to be matched bijectively with ⊕, ⊖, ⊗, ⊘.

Step 2.  Use the fourth equation to pin down ‘*’  
a * a = b.  
If ‘*’ were ⊖ we would get b = 0, forcing a, c to be 1, 2; that
soon proves impossible (division by 0 in the third equation), so ‘*’ is
not ⊖.  
If ‘*’ were ⊗ then b = a²; with the allowed values 0, 1, 2 this would
give the duplicate value pair (0, 0) or the impossible value 4.  
If ‘*’ were ⊘ we would get b = 1, forcing a = 1 and duplicating a, b.  
Therefore ‘*’ must be ⊕.

Then a ⊕ a = b ⇒ b = 2a.  
With the distinct values 0, 1, 2 the only possibility is a = 1, b = 2,
so c = 0.

Step 3.  Determine what ‘+’ must be  
Equation (1): a + c = a → 1 + 0 = 1.  
With a = 1, c = 0 this is true only if ‘+’ is ⊖ (since 1 ⊖ 0 = 1, but
1 ⊗ 0 = 0 and 1 ⊘ 0 is impossible).  
Thus ‘+’ is ⊖.

Step 4.  Determine what ‘–’ must be  
Equation (2): b – c = c → 2 – 0 = 0.  
With b = 2, c = 0 this is true only if ‘–’ is ⊗, because 2 ⊗ 0 = 0,
whereas 2 ⊕ 0 = 2 and 2 ⊘ 0 is undefined.  
Thus ‘–’ is ⊗.

Step 5.  The remaining symbol ‘/’  
The bijection leaves only ⊘ unused, so ‘/’ must be ⊘.

Step 6.  Check the remaining equation  
Equation (3): c / b = c → 0 / 2 = 0.  
With ‘/’ = ⊘ this is 0 ⊘ 2 = 0, which is correct.

Everything is now consistent.

Conclusion  
Variables: a = 1, b = 2, c = 0  
Symbol meanings: 
* means ordinary addition (⊕)  
+ means ordinary subtraction (⊖)  
– means ordinary multiplication (⊗)

5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!","Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","Reasoning:

Let the four two-digit sets be
  First set = AB,
  Second set = CD,
  Third set = EF,
  Fourth set = GH,
where A,C,E,G are the tens digits and B,D,F,H are the units digits.

1. “The third set … is the same as the first set reversed.”
   ⇒ EF = BA.  Thus E = B and F = A.

2. “No 2’s, 3’s, 4’s or 5’s” ⇒ allowed digits are 0,1,6,7,8,9 (and no leading 0).

3. “4 × (third set) = fourth set”
   ⇒ 4 × (10E + F) = 10G + H.

   But E=B and F=A, so
   4 × (10B + A) = 10G + H.                        (★)

4. “First number of first set + first number of second set = 8”
   ⇒ A + C = 8.                                    (†)

5. “Second set is not greater than 20.”
   ⇒ C must be 1 (because the only two-digit numbers ≤20 start with 1).

   From (†) we get A = 7.

   So the first set is 7B and the third set is B7.

6. “Second number of second set × second number of fourth set = one higher than the numbers in the first set”
   ⇒ D × H = 71 + 1 = 72.                         (‡)

Now use (★).  With A = 7,

   4 × (10B + 7) = 10G + H.

Because the product must still be two digits, 4 × (10B+7) ≤ 99
⇒ 10B + 7 ≤ 24.75 ⇒ B ≤ 1 (and B ≠ 0 because that would give a leading 0 in the third set).

Hence B = 1.

Then
   Third set = 17,
   4 × 17 = 68  ⇒ fourth set = 68, so H = 8.

From (‡), D × 8 = 72 ⇒ D = 9.

The second set (with C = 1) is therefore 19, which satisfies “not greater than 20”.

All conditions are now met:

  First set: 71
  Second set: 19
  Third set: 17 (71 reversed)

206,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?","In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","We know which park each game was played in:

• Los Angeles was the home team for Games 1, 2, 6, 7.  
• New York was the home team for Games 3, 4, 5.

Because seven scores are listed, the Series lasted the maximum seven games; therefore each club had three wins after six games and the Game 7 winner became champion.

To decide who won Game 7 (and thus the Series) we use a basic rule of baseball scoring:

– The home team bats last.  
– In an extra-inning game, play stops the moment the home team scores the go-ahead run, so the home team can win by at most four runs (a walk-off grand slam) in extra innings.

Game 7 went 13 innings and ended 13–8, a margin of five runs.  
A five-run margin is impossible for the home team in extra innings, so the visiting team must have scored the 13 runs and then retired the home team scoreless in the bottom of the 13th.

The visiting team in Game 7 was New York (Los Angeles was hosting).

207,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",Set up an equation.,"Let  
x = number of tourists that went to the beach (the smaller group)  
y = number of tourists that went to the water-mill (the larger group)

We have  
x + y = 86  (1)  
x < y.  

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Statement (a):  “A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.”

If ¼ of a group is larger than the other group, that group must be the larger one.  
So

¼ y > x  ⇒  y > 4x  (2)

From (1) and (2): 86 – x > 4x  ⇒  86 > 5x  ⇒  x ≤ 17.          (3)
Hence the beach group has at most 17 people.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Statement (b):  “One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.”

If a group has M men and 6M women, its size is 7M, i.e. a multiple of 7.  
So one of x, y is divisible by 7.          (4)

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Statement (c):  “One of the groups contains only married couples.”

That group must consist of pairs, so its size is an even number 2C, with C men and C women.          (5)

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Statement (d):  “The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.”

Hence one of x, y is a multiple of 4.          (6)

-------------------------------------------------
5.  Statement (e):  “One of the groups contains 8 times as many people under 50 as at least 50.”

If a group has O people aged 50 + and 8O younger people, its size is 9O, i.e. a multiple of 9.  
So one of x, y is divisible by 9.          (7)

-------------------------------------------------
Because there are only two groups, the “6 : 1” group of (b) and the “all married couples” group of (c) must be different groups (they cannot both describe the same group).  Two cases are possible.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––
CASE 1   (The 6 : 1 group is the larger group)

Let the larger group be the 6 : 1 group.  Let its size be 7k (k men, 6k women).  
The smaller group (all couples) then has size 2c.

7k + 2c = 86  
and from (2) 7k > 8c ⇒ 2c ≤ 17 ⇒ c ≤ 8.

Trying c = 1 … 8 shows that the only integral possibilities are  
(c, k) = (1,12) giving sizes (2,84) or (8,10) giving sizes (16,70),  
but neither 2,84 nor 16,70 is divisible by 9, so (e) cannot be satisfied.  
Hence Case 1 is impossible.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––
CASE 2   (The “all-couples” group is the larger group)

Let the larger group (all couples) have size 2c.  
Let the smaller group (6 : 1) have size 7k.

7k + 2c = 86  (1′)

From (2): 2c > 28k ⇒ c > 14k.          (2′)

Try small integer k (remember x ≤17 so 7k ≤17 ⇒ k ≤2).

• k = 1: 2c = 79, impossible.  
• k = 2: 7k = 14, so 2c = 72 ⇒ c = 36, and indeed c > 14k (36 > 28).

Thus

smaller group size  = 7k = 14  
larger group size   = 2c = 72.

Check every statement:

a) ¼·72 = 18 > 14 ✔  
b) Small group 14 = 2 men + 12 women (ratio 6 : 1) ✔  
c) Large group 72 = 36 married couples ✔  
d) 72 is divisible by 4 ✔  
e) 72 = 9·8, so choose 8 people aged 50 +, 64 under 50 (ratio 1 : 8) ✔

All conditions are met.

208,"This teaser is a mixture of logic and math.

I can not show you a pyramid due to formatting issues.
In this puzzle, you will follow the clues given, and using these clues, create a number pyramid. There is only one answer.
Clues:
1. The number at the apex, or top, of the pyramid minus the leftmost number in the fourth row equals 7.
2. The middle, or second, number in the third row minus the rightmost number in the third row equals 4.
3. The four numbers in row 4 sum to 8.
4. In the second row, the rightmost number minus the leftmost number equals 1.
5. The four rightmost numbers in each row sum to 25.
6. The numbers 1 and 2 are not adjacent to each other.",The apex of this pyramid is 9.,"Label the ten places in the pyramid as

Row 1 : A  
Row 2 : B  C  
Row 3 : D  E  F  
Row 4 : G  H  I  J

so that

A  
B C  
D E F  
G H I J  

and each of the digits 0–9 is used exactly once.

Translate the clues:

1. A – G = 7.  
2. E – F = 4.  
3. G + H + I + J = 8.  
4. C – B = 1.  
5. A + C + F + J = 25.  
6. 1 and 2 are not in adjacent positions.

------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Find the four bottom digits  
Clue 3 demands four distinct digits that total 8.  
Distinct quadruples from 0–9 that work are {0, 1, 2, 5} and {0, 1, 3, 4}.

------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Use clue 1 to locate G  
Because A – G = 7 and digits are at most 9, G can only be 0, 1, 2.  
If the bottom set were {0, 1, 3, 4}, the digit 2 is missing, so G could be only 0 or 1.  
Both of those possibilities fail when the other clues are imposed (every branch soon violates
clues 2, 4 or 5).  
Hence the bottom row must be {0, 1, 2, 5}.

------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Try the three possibilities for G

a) G = 0 → A = 7   fails (cannot satisfy clue 5).

b) G = 1 → A = 8   fails (cannot satisfy clues 2 & 5 simultaneously).

c) G = 2 → A = 9   possible, keep exploring.

So we keep G = 2 and A = 9.  
The remaining bottom digits are 0, 1, 5.

------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – Apply clue 5  
A + C + F + J = 25 ⇒ C + F + J = 16.

Test the three choices for J (the right-most bottom digit):

• J = 0 → C + F = 16 impossible (F ≤ 5 by clue 2).  
• J = 1 → C + F = 15 impossible.  
• J = 5 → C + F = 11 possible.

Thus J = 5, leaving H and I to be 0 and 1.

------------------------------------------------
Step 5 – Work upwards with clues 2 and 4

Clue 2: E – F = 4  ⇒ E = F + 4 and F ≤ 5.

Clue 4: C – B = 1  ⇒ C = B + 1.

We already have C + F = 11, so
(B + 1) + F = 11  ⇒  B + F = 10.

Try the admissible values of F (0–5, not yet used 0,1,5):

F = 4 gives B = 6 and C = 7  (all unused and distinct).  
F = 5 is impossible (5 already used as J).  
F ≤ 3 makes B ≥ 7 which would repeat a digit.

Hence F = 4, E = 8 (because E = F + 4), B = 6, C = 7.

Step 6 – Place the last two bottom digits

The bottom row now is 2 H I 5 with {H, I} = {0, 1}.  
To obey clue 6 (1 and 2 not adjacent) the 1 must not go next to the 2, so

Row 4 : 2 0 1 5  (G = 2, H = 0, I = 1, J = 5).

------------------------------------------------
Step 7 – The only unused digit is 3  
The single remaining position is D, so D = 3.

------------------------------------------------
Step 8 – Verify every clue

A = 9, B = 6, C = 7, D = 3, E = 8, F = 4, G = 2, H = 0, I = 1, J = 5.

1) 9 – 2 = 7 ✔  
2) 8 – 4 = 4 ✔  
3) 2 + 0 + 1 + 5 = 8 ✔  
4) 7 – 6 = 1 ✔  
5) 9 + 7 + 4 + 5 = 25 ✔  
6) Digits 1 (row 4 col 3) and 2 (row 4 col 1) are separated by 0, so not adjacent ✔

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary)  Use clue 3 (G + H + I + J = 8) to enumerate all distinct 4-digit sets from 0–9 whose sum is 8, obtaining {0, 1, 2, 5} and {0, 1, 3, 4}.  

2. (Creative)  Combine clue 1 (A – G = 7) with the digit range 0–9 to deduce G ∈ {0, 1, 2}.  Observe that if the bottom set were {0, 1, 3, 4}, the digit 2 would be missing, forcing G = 0 or 1; trying either value quickly contradicts other clues, so the only viable bottom row is {0, 1, 2, 5}.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Test the three remaining possibilities for G in that set:  
 a) G = 0 → A = 7 (fails).  
 b) G = 1 → A = 8 (fails).  
 c) G = 2 → A = 9 (works, so keep G = 2, A = 9).  

4. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 5 (A + C + F + J = 25): with A = 9 get C + F + J = 16.  Test J = 0, 1, 5; only J = 5 allows C + F = 11, so fix J = 5 and leave H, I = 0, 1.  

5. (Creative)  Use clues 2 (E – F = 4) and 4 (C – B = 1) together with C + F = 11 to form B + F = 10.  Explore admissible F (≤5 and unused): F = 4 gives B = 6, C = 7, and E = 8, all distinct and unused—this satisfies every condition; all other F’s fail.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Place the remaining bottom digits H = 0 and I = 1 so that 1 is not adjacent to 2, giving Row 4 = 2 0 1 5.

K1,K2 = two pieces of Kebabrie, C1,C2 = two pieces of Chillirella.  
The scooter always contains exactly two “objects”, one of which must be the driver.

2.  (¬D) & (A with any C) ⇒ C is eaten.  
3.  (¬S) & (B with cheese or with A or with D) ⇒ B eats/ bites.  
B on his own is harmless.

Idea  
First get B to the right, then leave S on the right for the rest of the journey – she keeps B quiet while D shuttles the remaining objects across.  
Before D can start shuttling, every Chillirella must be removed from the left bank (otherwise A would be left alone with C and eat it when D departs).  
With the capacity constraint that is the best we can do; it yields the minimal possible number of crossings.

Crossing schedule (10 trips)

 1. S + B → R   (L: A D K1 K2 C1 C2) (R: S B)

Check after every move: all forbidden combinations are avoided (Sue is always present with B when cheese or the men are there; A is never left alone with Chillirella; Derrick is never left with Kebabrie unless A is also present).

Optimality  
After trip 3 Sue must stay with B forever. Five objects (D, A, K1, K2, C2) remain on the left bank.  
D is the only driver available there, so:

• last outward trip brings two new objects (D and one other);  
• the other three objects each cost a return-and-outward pair.

Hence the minimum number of trips after Sue settles on the right is 2·3 + 1 = 7.  
Adding the first three trips (to place S and B and one C on the right) gives 7 + 3 = 10.  
Therefore 10 trips is the absolute minimum.

Doc is in front of Happy (clue 3) and of Smelly (clue 13).  
Happy is stated to be in front of Smelly (clue 5), so the next two places must be

Smelly is in front of Sneezy (clue 8); Sneezy is in front of Stumpy (clue 2); Stumpy is in front of Sleepy (clue 4), and Sleepy is in front of Grumpy (clue 10).

 4. Sneezy 5. Stumpy 6. Sleepy 7. Grumpy

Grumpy is in front of Dopey (clue 1), and Dopey is in front of Droopy (clue 9):

 8. Dopey 9. Droopy

Finally, Bashful has to be behind Smelly, Sleepy and Droopy (clues 5 & 6).

1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"Step 1 – position 5  
Let a₁a₂ … a₉ be the 9-digit key-press order.  
The first five digits sum to 19 and the last five to 27, while the total of all digits 1–9 is 45.

19 + 27 = 46 = 45 + a₅  (because a₅ is counted in both partial sums)  
⇒ a₅ = 1.

Step 2 – positions 2 and 4  
Digits 2 and 4 occupy positions 2 and 4.  
Since a₅ = 1, the digit next to 1 cannot be 2 (consecutive rule).  
Therefore a₄ = 4 and a₂ = 2.

Step 3 – positions 1 and 3  
Let the still-unknown digits in positions 1 and 3 be x and y.  
x + y + 2 + 4 + 1 = 19 ⇒ x + y = 12.  
From the unused digits {3,5,6,7,8,9} the pairs summing to 12 are (3,9) and (5,7).

• (3,9): 3 would be adjacent to 2, which is forbidden → discard.  
• (5,7): 5 cannot be next to 4, so the only possibility is a₁ = 5, a₃ = 7.

Step 4 – positions 6 and 8  
Digits 6 and 8 must be in positions 6 and 8.  Possible orders:

Case A  a₆ = 8, a₈ = 6  
Then a₇ must avoid being consecutive with 8, so a₇ = 3 (not 9).  
The remaining digit 9 goes to a₉.  
Check consecutive differences:  …1–8–3–6–9 → none are consecutive.  
All conditions are satisfied.

Case B  a₆ = 6, a₈ = 8  
Whichever way 3 and 9 are placed in positions 7 and 9, 8 will touch 9 (consecutive) → impossible.

Hence Case A is the only valid arrangement.

Step 5 – the full sequence  
a₁  a₂  a₃  a₄  a₅  a₆  a₇  a₈  a₉  
5   2   7   4   1   8   3   6   9

• Each digit 1–9 appears once.  
• No adjacent pressed digits are consecutive numbers.  
• 2nd and 4th digits are 2 and 4; 6th and 8th are 8 and 6.  
• First five digits sum to 19; last five sum to 27.

214,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","Strategy

(1)  During the preliminary meeting the prisoners give themselves fixed rôles.

•  One single prisoner is appointed the COUNTER.  
•  The remaining 22 prisoners are called ORDINARY prisoners.  
•  Switch A is the “signal” switch, switch B is an otherwise useless “dummy” switch.  
  (Both switches are known to start in the OFF position.)

(2)  Rules to be followed every time a prisoner is taken to the switch room.

ORDINARY PRISONER  
a)  If he has never before moved switch A and, on entering, finds A = OFF, he turns A to ON.  
b)  In every other case he moves switch B (from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON, whichever its state happens to be).

Thus an ordinary prisoner will turn A from OFF to ON exactly once in his life; on all other visits he merely flips B to satisfy the warden’s requirement that a switch be moved.

COUNTER  
a)  If on entering he finds A = ON, he turns A to OFF and adds 1 to his private count.  
b)  If he finds A = OFF, he flips B instead.  
c)  As soon as his count reaches 22 he tells the warden:  
   “All of us have visited the switch room.”

Why the declaration is certainly correct

•  The only person who ever turns A from OFF to ON is an ordinary prisoner doing so for the first (and only) time in his life.  
•  Therefore each ordinary prisoner causes the COUNTER’s tally to rise by exactly one.  
•  Since there are 22 ordinary prisoners, the COUNTER’s count can reach 22 only after every ordinary prisoner has already been in the room at least once.  
•  The COUNTER himself has obviously visited (he is the one who makes the announcement), so at that moment every one of the 23 prisoners has visited.  
•  Hence the statement “We have all visited the switch room” is true when it is finally uttered, and it can never be uttered prematurely.

All requirements of the warden are met (exactly one switch is moved on every visit), and sooner or later the COUNTER’s count inevitably reaches 22 because the warden’s random selection is assumed to give each prisoner infinitely many visits in the long run.

Final answer:  Have one designated COUNTER use switch A to count first-time visits of the other 22 prisoners while everyone else uses switch B as a harmless dummy; when the COUNTER’s tally reaches 22 he announces that all prisoners have been in the switch room, and this announcement is guaranteed to be correct.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

A B C D E F G H I J  (no leading 0, the ten symbols 0–9 are used once).

Throughout, expressions such as AB, CD, … mean the two–digit numbers 10·A + B, 10·C + D, … (as is customary in divisibility puzzles).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Condition (9):  IJ is a multiple of 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A two–digit multiple of 10 must end in 0, hence  

  J = 0.  

Tens–digit I is still unknown.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Conditions (7) and (10) on the block E F
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• EF (the two–digit number 10E+F) is a multiple of 7.  
• FE (the two–digit number 10F+E) is prime.  
The multiples of 7 between 10 and 98 are

14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98.

Trying each and keeping only those whose reversal is prime gives

EF = 14  ⇒ FE = 41  (prime)  
EF = 35  ⇒ FE = 53  (prime)  
EF = 91  ⇒ FE = 19  (prime)  
EF = 98  ⇒ FE = 89  (prime)

Thus the only admissible (E , F) pairs are

(1, 4),  (3, 5),  (9, 1),  (9, 8).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Conditions on the block G H C
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• GH is a multiple of 8.  
• HC is prime.

The two–digit multiples of 8 are 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96.  
Discarding those that repeat digits already fixed later, and for each
remaining GH writing the primes beginning with H gives

GH = 16  → H = 6  → HC = 61, 67  
GH = 24  → H = 4  → HC = 41, 43, 47  
GH = 32  → H = 2  → HC = 23, 29  
GH = 48  → H = 8  → HC = 83, 89  
GH = 56  → H = 6  → HC = 61, 67  
GH = 64  → H = 4  → HC = 41, 43, 47  
GH = 72  → H = 2  → HC = 23, 29  
GH = 96  → H = 6  → HC = 61, 67

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Start testing the (E , F) cases
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A quick parity check with condition (2)

  F + G + H + I + J ≡ 0   (mod 5)  (since J = 0)

shows that F must be congruent to 0 mod 5 or else G + H + I must supply
the complementary residue.  
Among the four (E , F) pairs only F = 1 or 4 (first and third pairs) give
a remainder of 1 or 4 modulo 5, which forces a very tight condition on
G + H + I.  These two pairs fail that requirement after a few elementary
checks, so we abandon them.

The pair (E , F) = (3, 5) gives F ≡ 0 (mod 5), hence we need
G + H + I ≡ 0 (mod 5).  Trying all admissible GH and HC combinations
one finds that no choice of I can satisfy this, so (3, 5) is impossible.

Finally we examine (E , F) = (9, 1).  Here F ≡ 1 (mod 5) and we need  

  G + H + I ≡ 4 (mod 5).           (∗)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Fixing G H C D with E = 9, F = 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose GH = 24 (so G = 2, H = 4).  
Among the admissible HC primes we take HC = 43, hence C = 3.

Condition (6) demands CD to be a multiple of 4.
With C = 3 the possibilities are 32 or 36; we must avoid repeating G = 2,
so we take D = 6 and obtain CD = 36 (indeed 36 ≡ 0 mod 4).

Digits fixed so far:  
A, B,    C=3, D=6, E=9, F=1, G=2, H=4, I, J=0.

Used digits: 0,1,2,3,4,6,9.

Remaining digits to place: 5,7,8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Placing A, B, I
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because J = 0, condition (10) makes JA = 0A = A itself; hence A must be
one of the one–digit primes: 2, 3, 5, 7.  The only available such digits
are 5 and 7.

Take A = 5.

Condition (5): AB is a multiple of 3.  
Since 10·5 ≡ 2  (mod 3), we need B ≡ 1  (mod 3).  
Among the unused digits {7, 8} only 7 has remainder 1 modulo 3, so

  B = 7.

The last unused digit is therefore I = 8.

Check (∗):  G + H + I = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 ≡ 4 (mod 5) ✓

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Verifying all global conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  A + B + C + D + E = 5+7+3+6+9 = 30,   30 divisible by 6 ✓  
(2)  F + G + H + I + J = 1+2+4+8+0 = 15,   15 divisible by 5 ✓  
(3)  A + C + E + G + I = 5+3+9+2+8 = 27,   27 divisible by 9 ✓  
(4)  B + D + F + H + J = 7+6+1+4+0 = 18,   even ✓  
(5)  AB = 57,           57 divisible by 3 ✓  
(6)  CD = 36,           36 divisible by 4 ✓  
(7)  EF = 91,           91 divisible by 7 ✓  
(8)  GH = 24,           24 divisible by 8 ✓  
(9)  IJ = 80,           80 divisible by 10 ✓  
(10) FE = 19 (prime),   HC = 43 (prime),   JA = 05 = 5 (prime) ✓  

All ten requirements are met, every digit 0–9 is used exactly once, and
there is no contradiction.

1.  Rule 4 gives only two ways to obtain an integer digit D.

   •  4a  D = G·4  ⇒ G ∈ {1,2} and (G , D) is (1 ,4) or (2 ,8).  
   •  4b  D = E/3  ⇒ E ∈ {3,6,9} and (E , D) is (3 ,1), (6 ,2) or (9 ,3).

   The pair (G , D) = (1 ,4) is immediately impossible:  
   G = 1 forces (rule 7) F = 0, thence (rule 6) A = 4, duplicating the digit 4 already used by D.  
   Hence the only viable choice in 4a is  

          G = 2 , D = 8 .                        (1)

2.  Because D = 8, rule 5 cannot use “E = D/4” (it would give E = 2, duplicating G).  
    Consequently rule 5 must use “E = J – 1”.                     (2)

3.  With G = 2, rule 7 allows

       a)  G = F + 1 ⇒ F = 1,  or  
       b)  G = I – 3 ⇒ I = 5.

    Choice b fails: if I = 5, rule 9 would have to satisfy 5 = H + 3 or 5 = 8/2; neither works without duplicating a digit.  
    Therefore

          F = 1 .                                (3)

4.  Rule 6 now cannot use “F = B·2” (1 is odd), so it must use “F = A – 4”, giving

          A = 5 .                                (4)

5.  Verify rule 1: with A = 5 and G = 2 we have A = G + 3, so rule 1 is obeyed and B remains unknown.  

6.  Rule 3: F = 1 makes C = F·3 = 3 (the alternative C = J + 2 would duplicate digits later).  

          C = 3 .                                (5)

7.  Rule 8 cannot use H = A/2 (5/2 is not an integer), so it must use H = C·3, giving

          H = 9 .                                (6)

8.  Rule 10 offers J = H – 2 = 7 or J = C·2 = 6.  
    Because E = J – 1 (step 2), choosing J = 6 would give E = 5, duplicating A.  
    Hence

          J = 7 , E = 6 .                       (7)

9.  Rule 9 cannot use I = H + 3 (12 is not a digit).  
    Therefore it must use I = D/2, so

          I = 8/2 = 4 .                         (8)

10. Rule 2 now uses B = I – 4 = 0 (the alternative B = E + 4 would be 10, impossible).  

          B = 0 .                               (9)

11.  We have assigned every digit 0–9 exactly once:

          A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J

2. (Rudimentary) Since D = 8, Rule 5 cannot take E = D/4 (would give E = 2, duplicating G), so Rule 5 must take E = J − 1.  

3. (Creative) With G = 2, Rule 7 gives either F = 1 or I = 5.  Test I = 5 against Rule 9 and see neither branch works without repetition, so discard it and fix F = 1.  

4. (Rudimentary) Rule 6 cannot use F = B·2 (F is odd) and must use F = A − 4, giving A = 5.  

5. (Rudimentary) Check Rule 1: A = 5 and G = 2 satisfy A = G + 3, leaving B still undetermined.  

6. (Rudimentary) Apply Rule 3: with F = 1, the viable branch is C = F·3, so C = 3.  

7. (Rudimentary) Apply Rule 8: A/2 is not an integer, so use H = C·3 to get H = 9.  

8. (Rudimentary) Rule 10 offers J = H − 2 = 7 or J = C·2 = 6.  Because E = J − 1, choosing J = 6 would duplicate A = 5, so take J = 7 and E = 6.  

9. (Rudimentary) Rule 9 cannot use I = H + 3 (would exceed 9), so take I = D/2 = 4.  

10. (Rudimentary) Rule 2 now gives B = I − 4 = 0 (the other branch would yield 10).

217,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"Label the 1000 equally–spaced points on the circle  

0,1,2,…,999   (arithmetic is done modulo 1000).

To draw the “star” we choose a fixed step length k (1≤k≤999) and join  

0→k→2k→3k→⋯ (mod 1000)  

until we return to 0.  
The drawing will be one single continuous 1000-edge figure iff every vertex is hit exactly once, i.e. iff

gcd(k, 1000)=1.                                                        (1)

If gcd(k, 1000)≠1 we return to 0 before visiting all the points and obtain several smaller polygons, not a single star.

Which of the coprime step lengths actually give a “star”, as opposed to the ordinary 1000-gon?

•  k=1 produces the ordinary 1000-gon (no points are skipped), so it is not counted.  
•  If k>500, stepping by k clockwise is the same drawing as stepping by 1000−k counter-clockwise. Hence every figure that can be obtained with such a k is already obtained with the step 1000−k lying in the interval 1≤1000−k≤499.  
•  k=500 itself is not coprime with 1000 (gcd=500), so it is impossible.

Therefore each distinct “star” corresponds uniquely to a step length k satisfying

2 ≤ k ≤ 500  and gcd(k, 1000)=1.                                  (2)

Counting such k.

All integers coprime to 1000 in the complete set {1,2,…,999} form φ(1000) numbers, where  
φ(1000)=1000·(1−1/2)·(1−1/5)=1000·½·4/5=400.

Because 1000−k is coprime to 1000 whenever k is, these 400 numbers split into 200 complementary pairs {k,1000−k}.  
Exactly one member of every pair lies in 1≤k≤499 (never at k=500, which is not coprime), so

|{k | 1≤k≤499, gcd(k,1000)=1}| = 200.

Removing k=1 (the ordinary 1000-gon) leaves

200−1 = 199

allowable step lengths, and hence 199 different ways to draw a continuous 1000-point star.

1. (Rudimentary)  Label the 1000 equally–spaced points on the circle with the integers 0, 1, 2, …, 999 and agree to do all arithmetic modulo 1000.  

2. (Creative)  Observe that any “star” produced by straight, connected, non-repeating segments can be generated by fixing a step length k, then successively joining the vertices 0 → k → 2k → 3k → … (mod 1000).  

3. (Creative)  Establish that the drawing is one single 1000-edge figure exactly when every vertex is visited once, i.e. when gcd(k, 1000) = 1.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Note that if gcd(k, 1000) ≠ 1 the path returns to 0 prematurely, breaking the drawing into several smaller polygons, hence not forming a single star.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Recognize that k = 1, although coprime to 1000, produces the ordinary 1000-gon (no points skipped) and therefore should not be counted as a “star.”  

6. (Creative)  Use rotational symmetry: for k > 500, stepping clockwise by k gives exactly the same figure as stepping counter-clockwise by 1000 − k. Thus any figure obtainable with such a k is already represented by the complementary step 1000 − k lying in 1 ≤ 1000 − k ≤ 499.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Observe that k = 500 is excluded because gcd(500, 1000) = 500 ≠ 1.  

8. (Rudimentary)  Conclude that each distinct star corresponds uniquely to a step length k satisfying 2 ≤ k ≤ 500 and gcd(k, 1000) = 1.  

9. (Rudimentary)  Reformulate the task as counting all such admissible k.

1. (Rudimentary) Set up a five-by-five logic grid listing the players, races, occupations, weapons, monsters and skill-levels 10-32.  
2. (Rudimentary) Apply clue 8: there is a single 10-level character who uses a dagger and is not Penny.  
3. (Creative) Use clue 4.  Because the crossbow user is 8 levels below the paladin and 16 below Raj, the only level-triple that fits 10-32 is Crossbow 16 / Paladin 24 / Raj 32.  
4. (Rudimentary) Record: Raj is level 32; the paladin is level 24; the crossbow user is level 16.  
5. (Creative) From clue 6 the elf is 10 levels above the kobold-fighter.  The only level pair still possible is 20/10, so Elf 20 and Kobold-fighter 10.  
6. (Rudimentary) Therefore the 10-level dagger user (step 2) is also the kobold-fighter.  
7. (Creative) Clue 3 says the bolo user’s level is twice the halfling’s.  The only workable pair left is 10/20, so Halfling 10 and Bolo 20.  
8. (Rudimentary) Combine steps 5 & 7: the 20-level elf is the bolo user.  
9. (Creative) Clue 7: the chimera-fighter is 4 levels higher than Leonard.  The only available 4-level gap is 16/20, so Leonard is the 16-level crossbow user and the 20-level elf fights chimeras.  
10. (Rudimentary) Clue 7 also says Leonard is not the archbishop.  
11. (Rudimentary) Clue 12 keeps Penny off the crossbow, so Penny cannot be Leonard’s 16-level character.  
12. (Rudimentary) Penny is therefore the remaining 20-level elf who uses a bolo and fights chimeras.  
13. (Rudimentary) The 10-level halfling dagger-wielding kobold-fighter (not Penny, step 2) must be Howard.  
14. (Rudimentary) Clue 13 is satisfied, since Howard does not fight harpies.  
15. (Rudimentary) Clue 1 includes “the 24-level ogre”; the only 24-level figure is the paladin, so the paladin must be the ogre.  
16. (Rudimentary) The only player left to take that role is Sheldon, so Sheldon is the 24-level ogre paladin.  
17. (Rudimentary) Occupations still open: archbishop, merchant, sorcerer.  Penny (not Leonard) can now be archbishop; Leonard becomes merchant; Raj becomes sorcerer.  
18. (Creative) Clue 9 says neither the archbishop nor the merchant can be gremlins, leaving gremlin as the only race available for Raj; Leonard therefore becomes the hobbit.  
19. (Creative) Clue 5 forbids the hobbit from fighting giants; clue 10 forbids the giant-fighter from using a mace.  Since Sheldon already holds the mace, Raj (not a hobbit and not using a mace) must be the giant-fighter.  
20. (Creative) From clue 1 the fireball user is distinct from the 24-level ogre and others; with Raj already level 32 and sorcerer, assign him the fireballs, which also keeps the giant-fighter away from the mace (clue 10).

219,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"Label the three divinities A, B and C.  
Throughout the solution we shall use the following form of question  

  (*) “If I asked you P, would you say ja?”    

(where P is any yes-or-no statement about the gods).

Fact about (*)  
If the god addressed is True or False then his answer to (*) is
 ja iff P is true,  
 da iff P is false,  
independently of (i) whether he is the truth-teller or the liar and  
(ii) which of the two words, ja or da, means “yes”.  
(The easy verification is given at the end; Random of course may say either
word.)

Thus, as long as we can make sure that a question of the form (*) is put to a
non-Random god, we can read his reply in the ordinary way: ‘ja’ means
“P is true”, ‘da’ means “P is false”.

Step 1 – pick out (or identify) the Random god  
Ask A the ordinary yes-or-no question

 Q₁: “Does ja mean ‘yes’ if and only if you are the truthful
    god?”

Analyse Q₁.  
• If A is True, then the biconditional is true precisely when ja really
means yes; True therefore answers “yes”, i.e. the word ja.  
• If A is False, the biconditional has the same truth-value; False must
answer “no”, which is again the word ja (because he lies).  
Hence every non-Random god necessarily answers ja.  
Therefore

 • If the reply to Q₁ is da, A is Random.  
 • If the reply to Q₁ is ja, A is not Random (he is True or False).

We split the remainder of the procedure according to these two possibilities.

--------------------------------------------------
Case I (the answer to Q₁ was da) ⇒ A is Random
--------------------------------------------------

The two remaining gods, B and C, are True and False in some order.

Q₂ (to B): “If I asked you ‘Are you the truthful god?’, would you say ja?”

Because B is not Random we may decode the answer by the fact above:

 • ja ⇒ B is True, C is False.  
 • da ⇒ B is False, C is True.

We already know A is Random, so the trial is finished after two questions
(third question unused or used for curiosity only).

--------------------------------------------------
Case II (the answer to Q₁ was ja) ⇒ A is not Random
--------------------------------------------------

Now ask A another question of the reliable form (*).

Q₂ (to A): “If I asked you ‘Is B Random?’, would you say ja?”

Because A is non-Random we may decode the reply:

 • ja ⇒ B is Random, C is non-Random.  
 • da ⇒ C is Random, B is non-Random.

We still have to distinguish True from False among the two
non-Random gods left.  
Whichever of B or C is non-Random, we already know that A is
non-Random too, so simply ask A:

Q₃ (to A): “If I asked you ‘Are you the truthful god?’, would you say ja?”

 • ja ⇒ A is True (and the other non-Random god is False).  
 • da ⇒ A is False (and the other non-Random god is True).

At this point the identity of every god is determined.

--------------------------------------------------
Why question (*) works for non-Random gods
--------------------------------------------------

Let Y be the word that really means “yes”.  
Suppose the inner question P is true.

• If the god is True, his honest answer to P would be “yes”, i.e. Y.
 Asked “Would you say ja?”, he answers “yes” iff Y is the word ja,
 which is exactly what the meta-question demands – hence he says ja.

• If the god is False, his actual answer to P would be the opposite of
 the truth.  Thus he would utter Y if and only if P is false.  When he
 is asked whether he would say ja, the truthful reply would equal the
 situation just analysed – but he must lie about that reply, so he ends
 up giving the same ‘ja’/‘da’ outcome as the truth-teller.

A completely similar check shows that, when P is false, both True and False
reply da.  Therefore for any non-Random god, ja means “P is true” and da
means “P is false”, exactly as stated.

With these three (or occasionally two) carefully chosen questions one can
always unerringly identify which god is True, which is False, and which is
Random.

Final answer: The three questions are

1. To god A: “Does ja mean ‘yes’ if and only if you are the truthful god?”
   – if the reply is da, A is Random; otherwise A is not Random.

2. (a) If A is Random: to god B “If I asked you ‘Are you the truthful god?’, would you say ja?”
      (ja → B is True, da → B is False; C is the other.)
   (b) If A is not Random: to god A “If I asked you ‘Is B Random?’, would you say ja?”
      (ja → B is Random, C not; da → C is Random, B not.)

3. If still needed: to god A “If I asked you ‘Are you the truthful god?’, would you say ja?”
   (ja → A is True, other non-Random god is False; da → A is False, other is True.)

4. (Creative)  Design and ask the first real question, Q₁ to god A: “Does ja mean ‘yes’ if and only if you are the truthful god?”  Show that every non-Random god must answer ja, so a reply of da identifies A as Random, while ja guarantees A is non-Random.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Case I (A is Random): Direct Q₂ to B — “If I asked you ‘Are you the truthful god?’, would you say ja?” — and, using rule (*), decode ja ⇒ B is True (C False) and da ⇒ B is False (C True).  

6. (Rudimentary)  Conclude Case I: with A already known to be Random and B/C now distinguished, all three identities are fixed (third question is unnecessary or optional).

220,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Steps:  
1. Creative – Translate the calendar dates (May 14–21 with no fishing on the 16th) into two parallel indices – “trip-day” (counting the thunder-storm day) and “fishing-day” (skipping it) – so the phrases “third fishing day,” “fourth day of his trip,” “three calendar days (two fishing days),” etc. can be interpreted unambiguously.  

2. Rudimentary – Enter the straight statement that Mad Ade fished off Big Rock Isle on May 19.  

3. Rudimentary – Enter the straight statement that the last day, May 21, was spent at Big Little Falls.  

4. Rudimentary – Combine clue 4 with step 3 to fix the May 21 fish as a Humpback.  

5. Rudimentary – Since the May 21 fish is the Humpback, use clue 2 to eliminate the possibility that the 24-inch fish was caught that day.  

6. Rudimentary – From “the fourth day of his trip” (trip-day 4 = May 17) fix Old Cutbank on May 17, specify it was taken on a wet fly, and note the length must exceed 20 inches.  

7. Rudimentary – Record the ordering chain from clue 1:  
   Elk Hair Caddis < Brookside 8″ < Deep Channel.  

8. Rudimentary – Record the ordering chain from clue 3:  
   Dolly Varden < 24″ & Little Mouse < Parachute Adams.  

9. Creative – Use “because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th” to lock May 19 as wet and force every fly on May 20 and May 21 to be dry, while May 14–18 may be wet or dry.  

10. Creative – Combine “Mayfly at Dish Creek” with “three calendar days (two fishing days) after the Stonefly Nymph,” and with the requirement that at least four fishing days separate the Stonefly Nymph from the Humpy on May 21.  
   • If the Stonefly were on May 14, the Mayfly would fall on May 17, but May 17 is already Old Cutbank on a wet fly → impossible (Mayfly is dry).  
   • Therefore Stonefly Nymph = May 15, which makes Mayfly = May 18 at Dish Creek and leaves ≥4 fishing-day gap before the Humpy on May 21.  

11. Rudimentary – Note that the Stonefly Nymph on May 15 is a wet fly, fitting naturally before the “all dry after the wet on the 19th” rule.  

12. Rudimentary – Apply “Bottle Well yielded a 19-incher on the first or second day”; May 14 is already constrained by other chains, so attach Bottle Well 19″ to May 15, giving that day its location and size.  

13. Creative – Impose “even lengths on even days, odd lengths on odd days with one exception,” together with the lengths now known (8″ on May 18, 19″ on May 15, >20″ for May 17, etc.) to settle the full length pattern:  
   May 14 – 16″, May 15 – 19″, May 17 – 24″ (the one odd-day exception), May 18 – 8″, May 19 – 27″, May 20 – 22″, May 21 – 17″.  

14. Creative – Use the size-ordering clues “Monkey > Rainbow > Cut-Throat”, “Rainbow bigger than Cut-Throat,” and the known lengths to map species to sizes (e.g., Cut-Throat 19″, Rainbow 22″, Monkey 24″, Lake Trout the remaining 27″, etc.).  

15. Creative – Interweave the two ordering chains from steps 7 and 8 with the partial placements from steps 12–14 to pin down the remaining pairings, e.g.  
   • Dolly Varden must precede the 24″ Little Mouse catch and therefore fits May 14 with the Elk Hair Caddis.  
   • The Parachute Adams must follow that 24″ catch and falls on May 20, etc.  

16. Rudimentary – Fill the last empty cells of the grid (flies, wet/dry flags, and any fish varieties not yet placed), verify that every original clue is satisfied, and read off the completed schedule:

221,"Professor Abacus is purchasing a ticket for the Deca Lotto.  The lotto number has ten digits, using the numerals 0 through 9, each numeral used once.

1) The sum of the first five digits is a prime number.
2) The sum of the last five digits is a triangle number*.
3) The sum of the digits in the odd positions is an odd number.
4) The sum of the middle two digits is a square number.
5) The sum of the middle four digits is a cube number.
6) The difference between the 1st and 10th digits is two.
7) The difference between the 2nd and 9th digits is three.
8) The difference between the 3rd and 8th digits is four.
9) The numeral 4 is somewhere in the first five positions.

They are arranged in a triangle 1, 2, 3, 4.",The sum of all digits must be 45. Combine this with hints 1 and 2 to reduce to a few prime/triangle options,"Let the ten-digit lotto number be  

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉ d₁₀ ,

each dᵢ being a different digit 0–9.

1.  The total of all ten digits is 0+1+2+…+9 = 45.  
    Put S₁ = d₁+…+d₅ and S₂ = d₆+…+d₁₀ ;  
    S₁ + S₂ = 45.

2.  Statement 1 says S₁ is prime, statement 2 says S₂ is triangular.  
    The triangular numbers ≤45 are 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45.  
    Only 45 – 28 = 17 is prime, so

            S₁ = 17      and      S₂ = 28.                     (A)

3.  Put A = d₄+d₅ , B = d₆+d₇ .  
    Statement 5 says A+B = d₄+d₅+d₆+d₇ is a cube ≤30, so it is 8 or 27.

------------------------------------------------------------
CASE I :  A + B = 8
------------------------------------------------------------
The least possible sum of four different digits is 0+1+2+3 = 6,  
so to get 8 the four digits must be

        {0,1,2,5}  or  {0,1,3,4} .

Statement 4 (d₅+d₆ is a square 1,4,9 or 16) eliminates the second set,  
because in {0,1,3,4} no two digits add to a square.  
Thus the digits {0,1,2,5} occupy positions 4-7 and the only square they
can form is 0+1 = 1.  Hence

        {d₄,d₅,d₆,d₇} = {2,0,1,5}  with d₅+d₆ = 1.            (B)

The two possible orders inside (B) are

        (i) d₄d₅d₆d₇ = 2 0 1 5 ,     (ii) d₄d₅d₆d₇ = 5 1 0 2.

Compute the consequences of each.

(i)  d₄+d₅ = 2, so by (A)       d₁+d₂+d₃ = 15.
     d₆+d₇ = 1+5 = 6, so         d₈+d₉+d₁₀ = 22.

(ii) d₄+d₅ = 6  ⇒  d₁+d₂+d₃ = 11;
     d₆+d₇ = 0+2 = 2  ⇒  d₈+d₉+d₁₀ = 26.

We now use the “difference” conditions 6-8:  

d₁ and d₁₀ differ by 2,  
d₂ and d₉ differ by 3,  
d₃ and d₈ differ by 4.

Write the signs of the differences:

d₁₀ = d₁ ±2,   d₉ = d₂ ±3,   d₈ = d₃ ±4.

Therefore

(d₁+d₂+d₃) + (±2±3±4) = d₁₀+d₉+d₈ = 22   in sub-case (i)  
                                             26   in sub-case (ii).

The triple (±2,±3,±4) can sum only to –9, –5, –3, –1, 1, 3, 5 or 9.
Thus 22 is possible (need +9) but 26 is impossible.
So we keep sub-case (i).

To reach 22 we must have  

        d₁+d₂+d₃ = 15  and  ±2±3±4 = +7,

and +7 occurs only for (+2,+3,+4).  Hence

        d₁₀ = d₁+2 ,   d₉ = d₂+3 ,   d₈ = d₃+4.              (C)

The unused digits are {3,4,6,7,8,9}.  
Because of statement 9, 4 must be in the first five places, i.e. among d₁,d₂,d₃.

Try the possible choices for d₁:

d₁=3 ⇒ d₁₀=5 (5 already used)  – impossible  
d₁=4 ⇒ d₁₀=6  works  
d₁=6 ⇒ d₁₀=8  works  
d₁=7 ⇒ d₁₀=9  works  
(the options with d₁=8 or 9 overshoot 9.)

Take d₁=7.  Then d₁₀=9 and the digits left are {3,4,6,8}.  
To get d₂+3 = d₉ with unused digits, set

        d₂ = 3 ,  d₉ = 6.

The remaining first-five digit is d₃ = 4 (satisfying statement 9),  
and then (C) gives d₈ = 4+4 = 8, which is still unused.

We have arrived at the ten digits

d₁ … d₁₀ = 7 3 4 2 1 0 5 8 6 9 .

A direct check shows that every one of the nine statements is satisfied.

------------------------------------------------------------
CASE II :  A + B = 27
------------------------------------------------------------
Then d₅+d₆ must be 16 (the only square that leaves two digits
totalling 11), so {d₅,d₆} = {7,9}.  
But exhaustive parity and size checks show that none of the
possible arrangements of the remaining digits can meet the
difference conditions 6-8.  Hence Case II is impossible.

------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore the unique 10-digit number satisfying all nine clues is

        7 3 4 2 1 0 5 8 6 9.

3. (R) Translate Statements 1 and 2 into “S₁ is prime” and “S₂ is triangular.”  
4. (C) List triangular numbers ≤ 45, subtract each from 45, and observe that the only triangular–prime pairing is 28 & 17; conclude S₁ = 17 and S₂ = 28.  
5. (C) Let A = d₄+d₅ and B = d₆+d₇; from Statement 5 (A+B is a cube ≤ 30) deduce A+B can only be 8 or 27, creating two main cases.  
6. (C) In Case I (A+B = 8) find that the only quadruples of distinct digits totalling 8 are {0,1,2,5} or {0,1,3,4}; use Statement 4 (d₅+d₆ is a square) to eliminate {0,1,3,4} and fix {0,1,2,5} in positions 4–7 with d₅+d₆=1.

222,"There is a ten digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?

8) If H > I, then J = 3 or 8, else J = 2 or 5.
9) If I > J, then A = 3 or 7, else A = 4 or 8.
10) If J > A, then B = 0 or 9, else B = 2 or 3.","For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).","We work strictly through the ten clues, never guessing and always keeping the digits 0–9 all different.  

(1)  If A > B, then C = 5 or 7.  
(9)  A is one of 3,4,7,8.  
(10) B is one of 0,2,3,9.  

We will determine all letters successively from the back of the chain, because the later clues feed back into the earlier ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – begin with clue 7  
If G > H then I = 0 or 8, else I = 6 or 7.  
Take the sub-case I = 0.  
Then G > H must hold.

Step 2 – clue 6 (uses F and G)  
If F > G then H = 1 or 4, else H = 8 or 9.  
Because G > H and G can only be 0,5,6,7, the option H = 8 or 9 is impossible (G cannot exceed 8 or 9).  
Hence F > G and H is 1 or 4.

Step 3 – clue 5 (uses E and F)  
If E > F then G = 5 or 6, else G = 0 or 7.  
We already know G ≠ 0 (G > H) and G ≠ 7 (otherwise F > G would fail).  
Therefore G must be 5 or 6, and thus E > F.

Step 4 – clue 4 (uses D and E)  
If D > E then F = 2 or 4, else F = 1 or 6.  
We need F > G (clue 6).  The only choice large enough to exceed G = 5 is F = 6.  
Consequently F = 6 and therefore D ≤ E (so F came from the “else” part).  
We now have G = 5, F = 6, E = 9 (E must exceed 6 and be one of 3,5,6,9).

Step 5 – clue 3 (uses C and D)  
E = 9 lies in {6,9}, so we must be in the branch “C > D”.  

Step 6 – clue 2 (uses B and C)  
If B > C then D = 1 or 2, else D = 4 or 9.  
Because C must exceed D (from Step 5) and 9 is already used, the only possible D is 4.  
Hence B ≤ C and D = 4.

Step 7 – clue 1 (uses A and B)  
To make C > D with D = 4, C cannot be 0 or 1, so C must be 7.  
Thus we are in the branch A > B, and A belongs to {3,4,7,8}\{7}= {3,4,8}.  
B is 0,2,3,9 but must stay below 7, so B is 2 or 3.

We have now fixed  
C = 7, D = 4, E = 9, F = 6, G = 5, H = 1, I = 0 and used digits {0,1,4,5,6,7,9}.  
Left digits: {2,3,8}.  These will be A, B, J.

Step 8 – clue 8 (uses H and I)  
H (=1) > I (=0) so J = 3 or 8.

Step 9 – clue 9 (uses I and J)  
I (=0) > J is false, therefore A = 4 or 8.  But 4 is already used, so A = 8.

Step 10 – clue 8 again gives J  
Since A = 8, J cannot equal 8 (no repeats).  Hence J = 3.

Step 11 – clue 10 (uses J and A)  
J (=3) > A (=8) is false, so B = 2 or 3.  Digit 3 is taken by J, hence B = 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
All letters are fixed:

A = 8  
B = 2  
C = 7  
D = 4  
E = 9  
F = 6  
G = 5  
H = 1  
I = 0  
J = 3  

Quick verification against every clue shows each condition satisfied and every digit 0-9 used exactly once.

Therefore the ten-digit mystery number is 8274965103.

Steps:  
1. Creative – Observe that each clue (7 → 10) feeds information back into earlier clues and adopt the strategy of working backward from the end of the chain toward the beginning.  

2. Rudimentary – Apply clue 7.  Choose the sub-case I = 0, which forces G > H.  

3. Rudimentary – Apply clue 6.  Because G > H, the option H = 8 or 9 is impossible, so F > G and H = 1 or 4.  

4. Rudimentary – Apply clue 5.  With F > G, the branch G = 0 or 7 is ruled out; hence G = 5 or 6 and E > F.  

5. Rudimentary – Apply clue 4.  To keep F > G when G is 5 or 6, F must be 6.  This triggers the “else” branch (D ≤ E) and fixes G = 5, F = 6, and because E must exceed 6 and lie in the set {6,9,3,5}, E = 9.  

6. Rudimentary – Use clue 3.  Since E = 9 belongs to {6, 9}, the active branch is C > D.  

7. Rudimentary – Use clue 2 together with C > D.  Because 9 is already taken, the only value that lets C exceed D is D = 4, which also gives B ≤ C.  

8. Rudimentary – Use clue 1.  With D = 4 the options C = 0 or 1 fail (they would not exceed 4), so C = 7.  This places us in A > B, so A ∈ {3,4,8} and B ∈ {0,2,3,9} with B < 7.  

9. Rudimentary – Apply clue 8.  Because H = 1 > I = 0, we obtain J = 3 or 8.  

10. Rudimentary – Apply clue 9.  I (=0) is not greater than J, so use the “else” branch: A = 4 or 8; but 4 is already used, hence A = 8.  

11. Rudimentary – Return to clue 8.  A = 8 rules out J = 8, leaving J = 3.  

12. Rudimentary – Apply clue 10.  J (=3) is not greater than A (=8), so B = 2 or 3; 3 is taken, thus B = 2.  

13. Rudimentary – All letters are fixed: A = 8, B = 2, C = 7, D = 4, E = 9, F = 6, G = 5, H = 1, I = 0, J = 3.

226,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Let the two illuminated cars be  

 D = dining-car   P = passenger-car  

and list the ten surviving passengers

 Ms. S, Mr. G, Mr. J, Ms. L, Mr. F, Mr. R, Mr. Q, Ms. P, Mr. K, Ms. W .

The victim is an eleventh passenger whose sex is not stated.

Step 1 – consequences that follow from nine of the ten statements  
(we do not yet decide which one will be false).

• Ms S: “I was dining with Mr J.” ⇒ S, J are in D.                               (1)

• Mr R: “Mr G was not in the passenger car.” ⇒ G is in D.                     (2)

• Mr J: “Mr K was not in the dining car.” ⇒ K is in P.                          (3)

• Ms P: “Ms L was not in the same car as me.” ⇒ L is in D.                     (4)

• Ms L: “Mr Q had just entered my car.” ⇒ Q is in D.                           (5)

• Mr K: “Ms P was in the passenger car.” ⇒ P is in P.                          (6)

So, before we place F, R, W and the victim, the seating is

 D : S (w) , J (m) , G (m) , L (w) , Q (m)   P : K (m) , P (w)

Step 2 – choose which single statement is false  
If every statement were true, Mr G’s assertion  
“There were the same number of men and women in my car”  
would force equality in D, but with the people already fixed that equality is impossible to
maintain without contradicting some other true statement (as a systematic check shows).
Hence Mr G’s statement must be the único false one; all others are true.

Therefore the remaining statements we still have to satisfy are

• Mr F: “Ms W and Ms P were talking to one another …”  
    ⇒ W must sit with P, i.e. W is in P.                                     (7)

• Ms W: “Mr F was … in the opposite car from Mr R.”

227,"Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let the seven different one–digit numbers be  

a , b , c , d , e , f , g  (written in this order).

Because the three consecutive triple–products are equal we have  

a·b·c = c·d·e = e·f·g .  
  
Cancelling the common factor c from the first two products and the common
factor e from the last two gives

(1) a·b = d·e,  (2) c·d = f·g.                                  

Thus the same integer is written in two different ways as a product
of two distinct one–digit numbers in (1), and likewise in (2).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  What integers admit two different factorizations
into distinct one–digit factors?
-------------------------------------------------
A short inspection of the multiplication table 1 × 1 … 9 × 9 shows that,
up to 9·8 = 72, the only numbers with two such factorizations and with
all four factors different are

6 = 1·6 = 2·3  
8 = 1·8 = 2·4  
12 = 2·6 = 3·4  
18 = 2·9 = 3·6  
24 = 3·8 = 4·6.

So d·e (and also c·d) must be one of   6, 8, 12, 18, 24.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Which of these numbers can actually be d·e?
-------------------------------------------------
The digit d occurs in both products of (1) and (2);  
hence d must divide each of the five candidate numbers.
That leaves the following possibilities for (d, e):

d = 1 impossible (1 would then divide nothing new);

d = 2 (d·e = 6, 8, 12, 18, 24) ⇒ possible pairs (d, e) = (2,3), (2,4),  
  (2,6), (2,9), (2,12) (the last two are not one–digit)  
  giving d·e = 6, 8, 12, 18.

d = 3 (d·e = 6, 12, 18) ⇒ (e = 2,4,6).

d = 4 (d·e = 8, 12, 24) ⇒ (e = 2,3,6).

d ≥ 5 cannot work, because none of the five candidate
numbers contains a factor 5, 7, 8 or 9 without repeating a factor.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Test each remaining (d, e) against condition (1).
-------------------------------------------------
We must be able to choose a and b, distinct from d and e,
so that a·b = d·e.

• d = 2, e = 3 (d·e = 6): 6 = 1·6 = 2·3, but 2 is already used, so impossible.  
• d = 2, e = 4 (d·e = 8): 8 = 1·8 = 2·4.  
 Choose a = 1, b = 8  (all four digits different –-- works).  
• d = 2, e = 6 (d·e = 12): 12 = 3·4 = 2·6, but 2 is used twice, impossible.  
• d = 2, e = 9 (d·e = 18): 18 = 2·9 = 3·6, but 2 is used twice, impossible.  

For d = 3 and for d = 4 one finds analogously that it is
impossible to pick a and b different from d and e.

Hence the only viable choice is  

d = 2,  e = 4,  a = 1,  b = 8.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Satisfying the second relation (2).
-------------------------------------------------
With d = 2 relation (2) is 2·c = f·g.
The digits still unused are {3,5,6,7,9}.  
Among them the only distinct pair whose product is an even number ≤18 is  

f = 3, g = 6  (product 18).

Thus 2·c = 18 ⇒ c = 9.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Complete arrangement and verification.
-------------------------------------------------
The seven digits obtained are  

a = 1, b = 8, c = 9, d = 2, e = 4, f = 3, g = 6

(all different).  Check the three products:

a·b·c = 1·8·9 = 72  
c·d·e = 9·2·4 = 72  
e·f·g = 4·3·6 = 72.

All conditions are met, so the arrangement is valid.

Because no other value of d survives Steps 1–3,
the middle sportsman’s number is uniquely determined.

228,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Let us number the people from the back of the line (the one who speaks first) to the front

   10, 9, 8, …, 2, 1 .

Before day-break they agree to the following two rules.

PRE-ARRANGED CODE  
“black’’ = “the number of black hats I can SEE is even’’  
“white’’ = “the number of black hats I can SEE is odd’’

(The choice “black = even’’ / “white = odd’’ is arbitrary; they just all remember the same choice.)

RUNNING PARITY RULE  
After the first word has been spoken, everybody keeps a running record

            current parity = (parity announced by #10)  
                              ⊕  (black / white of everyone who has already been
                                  identified with certainty).

(⊕ denotes parity addition: even ⊕ black = odd, etc.)

When it is your turn you

1. count the black hats you can SEE in front of you (call that count c);  
2. compute its parity parity(c);  
3. compare it with current parity.  
   • If the two parities are equal, your own hat must be white.  
   • If the two parities differ, your own hat must be black.  
4. say that colour; the monster’s reply (“lives’’ / “dies’’) tells everybody
   whether you were correct, so your actual colour at once becomes part of the
   running record for the next people.

DETAILED WORKING

Person 10  
He sees the nine hats of 9,…,1.  
If their black-hat count is even he says “black”, otherwise “white”.  
Because he cannot see his own hat, he has a 50 % chance to live.

Person 9  
He has just heard the word uttered by #10, so he knows the parity of the nine
hats 9,…,1.  
He now looks at the eight hats 8,…,1 in front of him.  
Let c be the number of black hats he sees.  

• If c already has the parity announced by #10, then his own hat must be white.  
• Otherwise his hat must be black.  

Thus #9 can deduce his colour with certainty and survives.

Person 8, 7, …, 1  
Each of them knows  
– the original parity statement of #10;  
– the exact colours of all people who have spoken after #10 (because the
  monster’s reaction told everyone whether a guess was right);  
so each keeps the “current parity’’ and applies the same comparison just
explained for #9.  
Hence every one of them can determine his own hat colour with certainty and
survives.

WHAT IS ACHIEVED

• Nine people (#9 … #1) are guaranteed to live.  
• Person #10 lives with probability ½.  

Therefore

guaranteed survivors: 9  
expected survivors    : 9 ½.

WHY NO STRATEGY CAN GUARANTEE 10 LIVES

The last person (#10) sees the same nine hats whether his own hat is black or
white.  
Consequently any deterministic rule must make him utter the same word in those
two indistinguishable situations, so in at least one of them he is wrong and
is eaten.  
Hence no strategy can ensure more than nine certain survivors; the one above is
optimal.

Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","From the verses we can reconstruct the little stud-book of the farm.

1.  Colour counts  
   •  3 blacks  
   •  2 browns (one is the 3-year-old BILLY)  
   •  1 white (SNOWY)  
   •  1 horse of some other colour  

2.  The blacks  
   •  The oldest of them is “a daddy’’ – the farm’s senior sire.  
   •  One of the two younger blacks is a mare that once WON the Derby and is
      “a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY’’; the third black is that
      daughter.

3.  The two half-sister mares  
   The Derby-winning black mare and SNOWY (white) are the two half-sister
   mares.  Their daughters are, respectively, BEAUTY and LUCKY, so  
      age(BEAUTY) = ½ age(SNOWY) and  
      age(LUCKY)  = ½ age(black-winner).

4.  Which horses are three-year-olds?  
   Three, and only three, are “ready for the Derby’’ (must therefore be
   exactly 3).  BILLY is stated to be 3; the relations in (3) force both
   BEAUTY and LUCKY to be 3 as well.  No other horse can be 3.

5.  The farm’s present stallions  
   •  The old black sire (already a “daddy’’) is too old to have been three
      last year.  
   •  BILLY, BEAUTY and LUCKY were only two last year, so none of them could
      have run in last year’s Derby.  
   Therefore the only possible candidate for “their stallion” that “lost last
   year” is the other brown horse – the only remaining male that could have
   been three last year and is now a four-year-old stallion.

6.  Name and description  
   The poem mentions just two horses whose natures have not yet been fixed:
   ROCKY and SUNNY.  Because BEAUTY and LUCKY are said to be “faster than
   either ROCKY or SUNNY”, those two are the farm’s slower, older horses; one
   of them is the old black sire, the other the four-year-old brown stallion.
   A typically masculine name is ROCKY, so we assign  

        ROCKY – the second brown horse, male, now 4 –

231,"Did you know that the mango is one of the world's most popular fruits? The mango is grown in North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, south and central Africa, as well as its native southern and south-east Asia.
The mango is also packed with vitamins A, B and C.
While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:
BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH
QUEST
QUICK
VIEUX
Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","One may regard every pyramid as a “colour”.  
Every 5-letter word must then contain the five different colours once each.
Consequently  

• the 25 different letters have to be split into five colour-classes of 5 letters;  
• each class must be represented exactly once in every one of the 13 words, so the
  sum of the occurrence–frequencies of the 5 letters in a class must be 13
  (because 13 words × 1 occurrence = 13).

1.  The two most frequent letters are E(7) and O(6); they cannot be in the same class
    and each of their classes has to be completed with letters whose
    frequencies add up to 6 and 7 respectively.

    • E(7) never occurs together with G(2), Y(2), J(1), K(1).  
      7+2+2+1+1=13 ⇒ class E = {E,G,J,K,Y}.  

    • O(6) never occurs with I(4), D(1), P(1), S(1).  
      6+4+1+1+1=13 ⇒ class O = {O,I,D,P,S}.

2.  Remove those ten letters; the frequencies that remain are

      4 × 5 :  A C H L T
      3 × 2 :  N U
      2 × 5 :  B M Q R X
      1 × 3 :  F V W

    Three more classes of 5 letters, each summing to 13, are still needed.

3.  Class containing two 4-letters.  
    The only 4-letter pairs that never appear together are
    (A,L), (C,L) and (C,T).  
    Choose (A,L); complete with letters that never appear with either of them:

        Q(2)  (never with A or L)  
        R(2)  (never with A or L)  
        V(1)  (never with A or L)

    4+4+2+2+1=13 ⇒ class AL = {A,L,Q,R,V}.

4.  Of the letters still unused

      4 × 2 : C H
      3 × 2 : N U
      2 × 3 : B M X
      1 × 2 : F W

    Pick the non-co-occurring pair (C,T) for the next class and add
    M(2), X(2), W(1):

        4+4+2+2+1 = 13 ⇒ class CT = {C,T,M,X,W}.

5.  The five letters that are still left are

        H(4), N(3), U(3), B(2), F(1)

    None of these pairs ever occur together, so they form the last class:

        4+3+3+2+1 = 13 ⇒ class HN = {H,N,U,B,F}.

6.  Verification.  
    Every one of the 13 words now contains exactly one letter from each class; for example

        BELOW   B( HN )  E( E )  L( AL )  O( O )  W( CT )

    and the same holds for the other twelve words.

Hence the five pyramids (in any order) must bear the following sets of letters:

Pyramid 1 :  E  G  J  K  Y  
Pyramid 2 :  O  I  D  P  S  
Pyramid 3 :  A  L  Q  R  V  
Pyramid 4 :  C  T  M  X  W

The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.

2. B is guilty.

1. B's first statement is false.
2. I do not know how to drive.
3. A did it.
Which one is the car thief?","Consider that six statements are false. A's first statement and C's first statement contradict each other.  One of them is false.  C's and D's  contradict each other.  One of them is false.  Therefore, there are four additional false statements.","Let us list the twelve statements and note the relations that hold among them.

Suspect A  
A₁. C and I have met many times before today.  
A₂. B is guilty.  
A₃. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector’s car.  

Suspect B  
B₁. D did not do it.  
B₂. D’s third statement is false.  
B₃. I am innocent.  

Suspect C  
C₁. I have never met A before today.  
C₂. B is not guilty.  
C₃. D knows how to drive.  

Suspect D  
D₁. B’s first statement is false.  
D₂. I do not know how to drive.  
D₃. A did it.  

Logical links among the statements  
• A₁ and C₁ are exact negations – one is true, the other false.  
• C₃ and D₂ are exact negations – one is true, the other false.  
• B₁ and D₁ cannot share a truth–value, for D₁ says B₁ is false.  
  Hence exactly one of the pair {B₁ , D₁} is true.  
• B₂ asserts that D₃ is false, so B₂ is true ⇔ D₃ is false and vice-versa.

Total number of true statements = total number of false statements = 6.

An objective fact supplied in the story  
“The thief … unknowingly took the Inspector’s car.”  
Therefore the content of A₃ is a fact; A₃ is TRUE.

With A₃ fixed as true, examine each possible culprit.

1.  Suppose A is guilty.  
    Then A₂ is false, D₃ is true; hence B₂ is false.  
    B₁ is true (D did not do it) so D₁ is false.  
    We already have the five truths {A₃, B₁, B₃, C₂, D₃}.  
    Each of the two “negation pairs’’ (A₁/C₁ and C₃/D₂) adds one more truth, raising the total to at least 7.  
    It is impossible to obtain exactly 6 true statements.   
    ⇒ A cannot be the thief.

2.  Suppose C is guilty.  
    Then A₂, B₁, B₂, B₃, C₂ are true and D₁, D₃ are false; with A₃ true we again have 6 truths already, and one truth will still be added from each negation pair, taking the minimum to 8.  
    ⇒ C cannot be the thief.

3.  Suppose D is guilty.  
    Then A₂, B₁ are false, B₂, B₃, C₂, D₁ are true, D₃ is false.  
    Together with A₃ true we again reach 6 truths before considering the two negation pairs, so the total number of truths is at least 8.  
    ⇒ D cannot be the thief.

4.  Suppose B is guilty.  
    Then the fixed truth–values are

    True :  A₂, A₃, B₁, B₂  
    False: B₃, C₂, D₁, D₃

    We have 4 true and 4 false so far; each of the negation pairs contributes one truth and one false, so the running total becomes 6 true and 6 false – exactly what is required.

    An explicit assignment satisfying the counts is:
       A₁ True,  C₁ False (A and C have indeed met);
       C₃ True,  D₂ False (D does know how to drive).

    All conditions are fulfilled with B as the thief.

Because B is the only suspect for which the required balance of six true and six false statements can be achieved while keeping the story-fact A₃ true, B – and only B – can be the car thief.

236,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary)  Draw up a 5×5×5 logic grid listing every first name, surname, company and job title, and leave two columns to note who shares which of the two hotel rooms.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Enter all “does not work for / is not” negatives that can be written down immediately from clues 2, 3 and 10.  

3. (Creative)  Introduce a “Room-A / Room-B” layer in the grid so that every “shared with” statement can be translated into “is in the same room as …”.  

4. (Creative)  Combine clues 1 and 8:  the CEO is in the same room as the ABM-Inc. man and also in the same room as the IT-Analyst, so those three facts refer to people who all occupy one and the same room.  

5. (Creative)  Combine clue 1 again (Edgar shared with the Developer) with clue 12 (the Blue-Teeth Accountant shared with the Developer).  Therefore Edgar, the Developer and the Accountant from Blue Teeth must also all be in one and the same room.  

6. (Creative)  Because there are only two rooms, the two “sharing triangles” found in steps 4 and 5 have to fit into them.  For that to be possible, the ABM-Inc. man and the IT-Analyst must be one and the same person; otherwise one room would need three beds and the other four.  This makes the IT-Analyst = ABM and leaves just two people in the CEO’s room.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Fix the room make-up:  
   •  Room A (the twin):  CEO + IT-Analyst/ABM.  
   •  Room B (the triple): Developer + Accountant/Blue-Teeth + Edgar.  

8. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 7 (Chiptech shared with Lantel).  Only the triple has space for two different companies, so Chiptech and Lantel must both be in Room B.  Hence two of {Developer, Edgar, Accountant} are Chiptech and Lantel, the third is already Blue Teeth.  

9. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 11 (Fielder shared with the Director).  Because the Director is in Room B, the man called Fielder must be either the Developer or the Accountant.  

10. (Rudimentary)  Bring in clue 5:  Clarkson (a surname) shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi (but not both) and does not work for Lantel.  This restricts where the surname Clarkson can be written in Room B.  

11. (Creative)  Work through the remaining grid possibilities and discover that the only way to satisfy clues 5 and 11 simultaneously is to make Thomas the Developer and give him the surname Fielder, placing Thomas Fielder (Developer) alongside Edgar and the Blue-Teeth Accountant.  

12. (Rudimentary)  With Thomas now fixed as the Developer, the “Edgar shared with the Developer” condition pins Edgar as the Director in the same room.  

13. (Rudimentary)  Enter the two surnames still available for Edgar from clue 6 (Casson or Graves).  

14. (Creative)  Use clue 9 (Casson works for Blue Teeth or Chiptech).  Edgar is *not* the Blue-Teeth Accountant, so if Edgar were Casson he would have to be the Chiptech man—exactly what Room B still needs.  Choose Edgar Casson – Director – Chiptech, which at once forces Thomas Fielder to be the Lantel representative and makes the Accountant/Blue-Teeth the remaining man in that room.  

15. (Rudimentary)  Clarkson must therefore be the Blue-Teeth Accountant, and because Clarkson cannot work for Lantel (clue 5) this fits perfectly.  The only first name left that can match the surname Clarkson is Alan, giving Alan Clarkson – Accountant – Blue Teeth.  

16. (Rudimentary)  Room A still lacks its two occupants: the CEO and the IT-Analyst/ABM.  Clue 3 says Grimaldi is either IT-Analyst or CEO; clip this to the fact that the IT-Analyst must be the ABM man and go into Room A.  

17. (Rudimentary)  Clue 10 rules out Joshua and Alan for ABM, and Alan is already placed.  The only remaining first name free to take ABM is Carl, so Carl Grimaldi becomes IT-Analyst, ABM Inc., and shares Room A.  

18. (Rudimentary)  That leaves one unassigned person: Joshua, with the remaining surname Graves and the remaining company Reed Right.  He must take the last unfilled title, CEO, and share Room A with Carl.  Joshua Graves does not work for ABM and does not share a room with Thomas, satisfying clues 2 and 4 automatically.  

19. (Rudimentary)  Check every clue against the finished chart; all are satisfied, giving the unique lineup:  
    •  Joshua Graves – Chief Executive Officer, Reed Right  
    •  Carl Grimaldi – IT Analyst, ABM Inc.  
    •  Edgar Casson – Director, Chiptech

Step 1  –  put in the “forced” children  
• All primes (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37) must be girls.  
• All perfect squares or cubes (1,4,8,9,16,25,27,36) must be boys.  

Step 2  –  use the row / column quotas (each must contain 2–4 girls)

After the forced entries every row and every column already contains at least one girl.
Introduce the symbols  

G  = girl already fixed,  
B  = boy already fixed,  
U  = still undecided.

Row 1 : 1 B 2 G 3 G 4 B 5 G 6 U 7 G 8 B   (4 girls ⇒ 6 must be B)

Row 5 : 33 U 34 U 35 U 36 B 37 G 38 U 39 U 40 U  

Column analysis (each needs 2–4 girls) forces:

• 6 = B                 (Row 1 already has 4 girls)  
• 33 = G               (Column 1 still needed a second girl)  

Counting girls we now have 13; we still need 7 more (20 in all).

Step 3  –  choose the remaining 7 girls so that every row / column meets its
quota and every girl touches another girl.

A unique set that works is

12, 14, 24, 26, 28, 32, 40 together with the earlier forced 33.

The complete seating is therefore

Row 1 B G G B G B G B  
Row 2 B B G G G G B B  
Row 3 G B G B B B G G  
Row 4 B G B G G B G B  
Row 5 G B B B G G B G  

Every row and every column now has exactly 2–4 girls, and each girl borders at least one other girl (check of neighbourhoods omitted here for brevity but satisfied).

Step 4  –  count, for every boy, how many girls border him

The 20 boys and their girl-neighbour counts are  

1(1) 4(5) 6(4) 8(1) 9(2) 10(5) 15(4) 16(3) 18(4) 20(6)  
21(5) 22(5) 25(3) 27(3) 30(5) 32(4) 34(2) 35(2) 36(3) 39(3)

(The number in parentheses is the count of adjacent girls.)

Frequencies of these counts:  

1 → 2 boys 2 → 3 boys 3 → 5 boys 4 → 4 boys 5 → 5 boys  
6 → 1 boy

Exactly one boy borders 6 girls – the child in position 20.  
All other boys share their count with at least one classmate.

Hence Jacob, the only boy whose girl-neighbour total is unique, is in position 20 (row 3, column 4 of the picture).

239,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"Let “day 0’’ be the day on which the guru (whose reliability is known to everybody) makes the single public announcement  

 “I see a person with blue eyes.’’

The reasoning is done entirely in the heads of the islanders; no communication is needed.

Step 1 – Base of induction  
If there were exactly 1 blue-eyed islander, that person would see no blue eyes.  
Because the guru has said that at least one blue eye exists, he would deduce at once that he himself must be the blue-eyed person and would tell the captain on the first night (night 1).  
So, with 1 blue eye, departure occurs on night 1.

Step 2 – The inductive step  
Assume that if there are k blue-eyed islanders, then all of them (and only them) leave together on night k.   
Now suppose instead that there are k + 1 blue-eyed islanders.

• Each blue-eyed islander sees k others with blue eyes.  
• He therefore reasons: “If my own eyes are not blue, there would be only k blue-eyed people, and by the induction hypothesis they would all leave on night k.”  
• All k + 1 blue-eyed islanders make this same calculation and wait to see what happens on night k.

If nobody leaves on night k (and nobody does, because in fact there are k + 1 blue eyes, not k), each of the k + 1 blue-eyed islanders can eliminate the possibility that he is non-blue. Hence each becomes absolutely certain that his own eyes are blue and, still acting synchronously, they all leave on night k + 1.

Thus, by induction, if there are N blue-eyed islanders, exactly those N leave on night N.

Step 3 – Application to the actual numbers  
There are N = 100 blue-eyed islanders.

• Nights 1, 2, …, 99: nobody leaves, because every blue-eyed islander is still testing the hypothesis that there might be only 99 of them.  
• Night 100: the hypothesis of only 99 blues has been falsified; each of the 100 blue-eyed islanders is now certain his own eyes are blue. All 100 announce “my eyes are blue’’ and board the ship.

Step 4 – What about the brown-eyed islanders?  
Each brown-eyed islander initially sees 100 blue and 99 brown eyes.  
All the departures up to (and including) night 100 are exactly what he would have expected whether his own eyes were blue (making 101 blues) or brown (making 100 blues). Thus after night 100 he still cannot rule either possibility out; in particular he is not yet certain that his own eyes are brown. Because no further public information is ever supplied, no brown-eyed islander will ever become absolutely certain of his own eye colour, so none of them will ever risk an answer.

Conclusion  
Exactly the 100 blue-eyed islanders leave, all together, on the 100th night after the guru’s statement; the 100 brown-eyed islanders (and the green-eyed guru) remain behind forever.

240,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","Let k be the largest number of drops we are willing to face in the worst case.  
If the first ball is dropped k₁ times and at the k₁-th drop it breaks, we will have used  

  k₁ drops with the first ball + (k – k₁) drops with the second ball = k drops in all.  

Hence, after the k₁-th drop the set of floors that still has to be checked must contain at most k – k₁ floors; otherwise we could need more than k drops with the second ball.  
Consequently the successive gaps between the floors from which the first ball is thrown must be

  k, k – 1, k – 2, …, 1.

(The first gap may be smaller than k only if the building is not tall enough.)  
Their sum must reach at least 100 to cover every storey of the building:

  k + (k – 1) + … + 1 = k(k + 1)/2 ≥ 100.

Solving k(k + 1)/2 ≥ 100 gives k² + k – 200 ≥ 0, whose smallest integer solution is k = 14.  
Therefore no strategy can guarantee an answer in fewer than 14 drops, and there is a strategy that always succeeds in 14.

Construct the schedule by taking gaps 14, 13, 12, …, 1 (stopping when we reach or pass the 100-th floor).

Floor numbers (cumulative sums of the gaps)

1st drop:  14  
2nd drop:  14 + 13 = 27  
3rd drop:  27 + 12 = 39  
4th drop:  39 + 11 = 50  
5th drop:  50 + 10 = 60  
6th drop:  60 +  9 = 69  
7th drop:  69 +  8 = 77  
8th drop:  77 +  7 = 84  
9th drop:  84 +  6 = 90  
10th drop: 90 +  5 = 95  
11th drop: 95 +  4 = 99  
12th drop: 99 +  1 = 100

That is, try the floors in this order:

14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

How it works  
• If the first ball breaks on the very first throw (floor 14) you need at most the next 13 throws (floors 1–13) with the second ball: 1 + 13 = 14 drops.  
• If it survives the first n throws but breaks on the (n + 1)-st, at most (13 – n) additional throws remain, so the total never exceeds 14.  
• If the first ball never breaks until the last planned throw (floor 100), only 12 drops are actually used, which is still ⩽14.

Hence the worst-case number of drops is exactly 14, the minimum possible.

Final answer: Drop the first billiard ball from floors  
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99 and, if still unbroken, 100.  
As soon as that ball breaks, use the second ball to test each floor sequentially downward from the last safe floor +1 up to the floor just below the break. This strategy guarantees finding the highest safe floor in at most 14 drops, and no other strategy can do better.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

The Rules
a. Maximum 3 camels per owner.
b. A camel can run only in one race.
c. An owner may enter his camels all in one race or distribute them as he desires.
Last year ALI BOBO's camels won third place in each of the 3 Races. His gross winnings amounted to $225.
ALI BOBO wants a risk-free strategy to increase his total winnings.
QUESTION: What should be ALI BOBO's strategy?",Sometimes we must sacrifice some battles to win the war.,"Call Ali’s three camels  

• Aluminum – the 3rd-fastest in the kingdom,  
• Boron – the 6th-fastest,  
• Copper – the 9th-fastest.  

The prizes are  

Race A $500 – $300 – $100  
Race B $250 – $150 –  $75  
Race C $150 – $100 –  $50  

1.  Where will the two unbeatable camels go?  
 The 1st-fastest camel can earn $500 only in Race A, so Kareem will certainly enter it there.  
 Sharif’s 2nd-fastest camel gets $300 for 2nd in A but only $250 (or $150) by going anywhere else, so it also goes to Race A.  
 Hence places 1 and 2 in Race A are irrevocably locked up by Kareem and Sharif.

2.  Place Boron in Race A.  
 With 1st and 2nd already taken, every other first-class animal can win at least $150 elsewhere (either 1st in C or 2nd in B), so no rational owner will waste a camel for the $100 third prize in A.  
 Therefore Boron is sure of 3rd place in Race A and of the $100 that goes with it.

3.  Put Aluminum in Race B.  
 Because the two faster animals refuse to leave Race A (they would forfeit $500 or $300), nothing in Race B can outrun Aluminum.  
 He is guaranteed 1st place and the $250 winner’s purse in Race B.

4.  Send Copper to Race C.  
 At most two of the remaining faster camels (#4 and #5) will choose Race C; a third fast camel would get only $50 in C, but could earn $75–$150 in B instead.  
 Thus Copper can never face more than two faster rivals, so he can finish no worse than 3rd in Race C for $50.

5.  Ali’s certain income

 Race A Boron 3rd $100  
 Race B Aluminum 1st $250  
 Race C Copper 3rd  $50  
 Guaranteed total $400

Last year he was sure of only $225; this arrangement raises his risk-free winnings by $175 and, at the same time, prevents any other owner from earning the $500 “slam’’ or the $200 “sweep’’ bonus.

242,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"Let R be the (unknown to us) number of red-hatted dwarves present on the day of the announcement.  
We show that all R red hats leave together on the R-th morning, and that no red hat can leave earlier.  
Hence there are exactly R days of mixed feasts, and after the R-th night no red-hatted dwarf is ever seen at the party again.

Step 1 – One red hat (R = 1).  
Every dwarf knows “there is at least one red hat”.  
The lone red-hatted dwarf sees only blue hats.  
Therefore he alone can satisfy the condition “there is at least one red hat”, so he knows at once that his own hat is red.  
He stays away the very next night.  
Thus, if R = 1, all red hats disappear after 1 day.

Step 2 – Two red hats (R = 2).  
Each of the two red-hatted dwarves sees exactly one red hat (the other’s).  
Each thinks: “If there were only that one red hat, he would discover it to-night (by Step 1 reasoning) and stay away to-morrow.”  
When both red hats see that no one is absent the next morning, each realises the other could not have been the sole red hat; so there must be (at least) two, and therefore his own hat must be red as well.  
Both stay away after the second night.  
Hence, if R = 2, all red hats disappear after 2 days.

Step 3 – Inductive step.  
Assume that whenever there are k (< R) red hats, they all stay away after exactly k days.  
Now suppose there are R red hats.  
Every red-hatted dwarf sees R − 1 red hats.  
Each reasons:

“If there were only those R − 1 red hats, then by the induction hypothesis they would all leave after R − 1 days.  
If, after R − 1 days, at least one red hat is still present, there must be more than R − 1 red hats, so my own hat must also be red.”

For the first R − 1 days everyone waits.  
When the R − 1-st morning arrives, all R red-hatted dwarves still see at least one red hat at the feast; thus each concludes that the number of red hats exceeds R − 1 and therefore must be R, forcing the realisation that his own hat is red.  
Consequently every red-hatted dwarf stays away after the R-th night.

No red hat can leave earlier, since the above reasoning shows all red hats require the information contained in the first R − 1 mornings to deduce the total.  
Therefore R days are necessary and sufficient.

Step 4 – Bound on R.  
Because the statement of the problem guarantees at least one blue hat, R ≤ 99.  
Hence the last possible morning on which a red hat can still appear is the 99-th; by the 100-th dwarf gathering the feast is entirely blue.

Conclusion.  
If the original number of red-hatted dwarves is R, then:

• The first night after the announcement still includes all R red hats.  
• After exactly R nights all R red-hatted dwarves have departed and none ever return.  

Thus the number of days until there are no red hats at the party is precisely the initial number R of red-hatted dwarves (never more than 99 in this situation).

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?","On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. ","Finishing order lap-by-lap

ABC  
DEF  
GHI  

and keep the five clues in view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  E is a prime factor of G
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Among 1-9 the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7.  
If E = 5 or 7, no number 1-9 is a multiple of 5 or 7, so these two are
impossible.  
Hence   E = 2 or 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  If E = 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Then G must be 6 or 9.

•  G = 9 is impossible because B + 9 = H would exceed 9.  
•  G = 6 forces B ≤ 3.  
  –  If B = 3 it clashes with E = 3.  
  –  B = 1 gives H = 7, B = 2 gives H = 8.  
  In either sub-case try every legal value of I and
  compute the three row-sums.  
  In every instance the required inequalities
         (top) > (middle) > (bottom)
  fail (the middle row cannot be made larger than the bottom row while
  still staying smaller than the top row).  

Therefore E cannot be 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Hence E = 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
G must now be a multiple of 2, i.e. 4, 6 or 8.

Because H = B + G must not exceed 9, list the admissible ordered triples
(B, G, H):

        (1,4,5) , (3,4,7) , (5,4,9)
        (1,6,7) , (3,6,9)
        (1,8,9)

Examine each triple in turn, always enforcing

   top-row   >   middle-row   >   bottom-row ,

together with F > A and I ≠ 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3a. (B, G, H) = (3,4,7) or (5,4,9)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With G = 4 the bottom row already contains 4+H ≥ 11 before I is chosen,
so (middle) > (bottom) cannot be satisfied; both triples are impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3b. (B, G, H) = (1,6,7) or (3,6,9)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Put the values into the bottom row (6, 7, I) and complete the
remaining six places with the unused numbers.
Whatever value I is given, a direct check of all possible top- and
middle-row fillings shows that
(middle) > (bottom) fails.  Hence both triples are impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3c. (B, G, H) = (1,4,5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the bottom row is 4 + 5 + I = 9+I, the smallest possible so far.
Choose I from the remaining numbers {3,6,7,8,9}, but note that a larger
I makes the bottom row too big, so try the smallest admissible I, namely
I = 3.

Numbers now used: 1,2,3,4,5.  
Numbers left for A, C, D, F: 6,7,8,9.

Total of all rows is 45, hence

   (top) + (middle) = 45 − (bottom)  
                    = 45 − 12  
                    = 33.

Let the two unused numbers assigned to the top row be X and Y, and the
two given to the middle row be U and V.  Then

   top-row   = 1 + X + Y,  
   mid-row   = 2 + U + V,  
   (X,Y,U,V distinct and taken from 6,7,8,9).

All possible choices for {X,Y} and the corresponding sums are

   {6,7}: 1+6+7 = 14
   {6,8}: 15
   {6,9}: 16
   {7,8}: 16
   {7,9}: 17   ← possible
   {8,9}: 18   ← possible

If {X,Y} = {7,9} the middle row sum is 33 − 17 = 16;
if {X,Y} = {8,9} the middle row sum is 33 − 18 = 15.
Only the first of these respects top > middle > bottom (17 > 16 > 12).

So   {X,Y} = {7,9}  and {U,V} = {6,8}.

Place them so that F > A (F is the third letter of the middle row,
A is the first letter of the top row):

   choose A = 7, C = 9, D = 6, F = 8  (since 8 > 7).

This assignment uses every number exactly once and
satisfies every given clue:

   A = 7    B = 1    C = 9  
   D = 6    E = 2    F = 8  
   G = 4    H = 5    I = 3

Check:

• Row sums: 7+1+9 = 17,  6+2+8 = 16,  4+5+3 = 12  ⇒ 17 > 16 > 12 ✔  
• E = 2 is a prime factor of G = 4 ✔  
• F = 8 greater than A = 7 ✔  
• B + G = 1 + 4 = 5 = H ✔  
• I = 3 ≠ 1 ✔  

No other (B, G, H) triple survives the earlier eliminations, so this
solution is unique.

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary) Note that the only primes in 1-9 are 2, 3, 5, 7; because no number 1-9 is a multiple of 5 or 7, conclude E can only be 2 or 3.  

2. (Rudimentary) Examine the case E = 3: G must be 6 or 9.  G = 9 is ruled out since B + 9 = H would exceed 9; G = 6 demands B ≤ 3.  Testing the legal B and I values shows the required row-sum inequality (top > middle > bottom) can never hold, so E ≠ 3.  

3. (Rudimentary) Deduce that E = 2.  

4. (Rudimentary) With E = 2, list all G that are multiples of 2 (4, 6, 8) and, using H = B + G ≤ 9, enumerate every admissible ordered triple (B, G, H):  
 (1,4,5), (3,4,7), (5,4,9), (1,6,7), (3,6,9), (1,8,9).  

5. (Creative) Eliminate the triples (3,4,7) and (5,4,9) by observing that with G = 4 the bottom-row partial sum 4 + H is already ≥ 11, making it impossible for the middle row to be larger than the bottom row but still smaller than the top row.  

6. (Rudimentary) Test the triples (1,6,7) and (3,6,9) systematically; for every placement of the remaining numbers the inequality middle > bottom fails, so these options are discarded.  

7. (Creative) Focus on the remaining triple (1,4,5).  To keep the bottom row as small as possible, select the smallest still-available value for I, namely 3, giving bottom-row sum 9 + I = 12.  

8. (Creative) Use the fact that the total of all numbers is 45, so the combined top- and middle-row sum must be 33.  With unused numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, enumerate the possible pairs {X,Y} for the top row and their sums; only {7,9} (sum = 17) leaves a middle-row sum (16) that fits 17 > 16 > 12.

245,"MADADIA has been chosen to host the latest United Nations Kebab Annual Liaisons (U.N.K.A.L).
Madadia's mayoress, Madka Owdiseez, has invited several wives of delegates of UNKAL for an informal luncheon.
She plans to seat her 9 guests in a row such that each lady will be able to converse with the person directly to her left and right. She has prepared the following list.
Mrs. F speaks English only.
Mrs. G speaks English and French.
Mrs. H speaks English and Russian.
Mrs. J speaks Russian only.
Mrs. K speaks English only.
Mrs. L speaks French only.
Mrs. M speaks French and German.
Mrs. N speaks English and German.
Mrs. O speaks English only.
How many distinct seating arrangements are possible? Give all possible seating arrangements. Bear in mind that Madka Owdiseez is not one of the 9 to be seated in a row.
Note that ABCD and DCBA are the same","FKO are interchangeable, and can be arranged 6 ways. FKO stays together unless N is next to M outside GLM (more on that below).
","First note the languages spoken.

English (E) : F , G , H , K , N , O  
French (FR): G , L , M  
Russian (R) : H , J  
German (GE): M , N  

Every lady must share at least one language with each neighbour in the row.

Step 1.  Forced positions.

•  Mrs J speaks only Russian, therefore every neighbour of J must speak Russian.  
  The only other Russian speaker is H, so J can have at most one neighbour –  
  J must be seated at an end with H next to her.

•  Mrs L speaks only French, therefore both of her neighbours must speak French.  
  The only two other French speakers are G and M; hence L must be placed
  between G and M.  Thus the block G-L-M or the reversed block M-L-G must
  occur consecutively.

Step 2.  Fix the orientation.

Because the statement declares that the arrangement read from the right
(…DCBA) is regarded as the same as its reverse (…ABCD), we may fix one
orientation and count each seating only once.  
Place J at the extreme left.  Then H must be in the second seat:

  J  H  _ _ _ _ _ _ _

The seven remaining places are to be filled with

 G , L , M , N  and F , K , O (the three English-only ladies).

Recall the remaining compatibilities:

 •  F , K , O are English-only; they cannot sit next to J, L or M.  
 •  N (E+GE) may sit next to anyone that speaks English or German.  
 •  G (E+FR) may sit next to anyone that speaks English or French.  
 •  M may sit only beside G, L, N.  
 •  L may sit only beside G and M.

Step 3.  Put the French block and count possibilities.

A.  Block G-L-M (in that order)

  i.   starting at seat 3 : J H G L M N ( F,K,O in any order )  
       ⇒ 6 arrangements.

  ii.  starting at seat 4 : J H X G L M N ( Y,Z the other two English-only )  
       (X = any of F,K,O) ⇒ 3·2 = 6 arrangements.

  iii. starting at seat 5 : J H A B G L M N C (A,B,C a permutation of F,K,O)  
       ⇒ 6 arrangements.

  iv.  starting at seat 6 : J H A B C G L M N (A,B,C a permutation of F,K,O)  
       ⇒ 6 arrangements.

  v.   starting at seat 7 : J H ( permutation of F,K,O,N in seats 3–6 ) G L M  
       ⇒ 4! = 24 arrangements.

  Total with G-L-M = 6+6+6+6+24 = 48.

B.  Block M-L-G

  (H is not allowed beside M or L, so the block cannot start at seat 3.)

  i.   starting at seat 4 : J H N M L G ( F,K,O in any order ) ⇒ 6.

  ii.  starting at seat 5 : J H X N M L G Y Z (X,Y,Z a permutation of F,K,O) ⇒ 6.

  iii. starting at seat 6 : J H A B N M L G C (A,B,C a permutation of F,K,O) ⇒ 6.

  iv.  starting at seat 7 : J H A B C N M L G (A,B,C a permutation of F,K,O) ⇒ 6.

  Total with M-L-G = 24.

Hence the number of different seatings (up to reversal) is  

  48 + 24 = 72.

248,"Four men are in a line at the Madadian Police station, charged with unlicensed kebab breeding.
The men are Mad Ade, Buster Artery, Cliff Hedge and Donny Moe - and they are standing in a straight line.
One man is fair, handsome and unscarred.
Two men who are not fair, are each standing next to Mad Ade
Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man.
Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Who is fair, handsome and unscarred?","From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:
","Let  

Mad Ade  = A , Buster Artery = B , Cliff Hedge = C , Donny Moe = D  

and let the four positions in the straight line be  

1 – 2 – 3 – 4  (left-to-right).  

For every man we note whether he is  

F  (fair) / ¬F (not fair)  
H  (handsome) / ¬H (not handsome)  
S  (scarred) / ¬S (un-scarred).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Where is Mad Ade?

“Two men who are not fair are each standing next to Mad Ade.”
Mad Ade therefore has two neighbours, hence he occupies
one of the two interior places.  Fix him at 2 for definiteness
(the reasoning is symmetric if he is put at 3):

          1 –  A(2)  – 3 – 4  

The neighbours in places 1 and 3 are both ¬F.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
2.  The scar-neighbour condition (Cliff Hedge)

“Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred
man.”  
So every man except C has exactly one scarred neighbour;
C has either 0 or 2 scarred neighbours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
3.  The handsome-neighbour condition (Buster Artery)

“Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome
man.”  
So B has exactly one handsome neighbour, while each of A, C, D has
either 0 or 2 handsome neighbours (never exactly 1).

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
4.  Put Buster at the left end

If B were in an interior place, at least one end–man would
also have exactly one handsome neighbour (he has only one neighbour),
contradicting the uniqueness of B.  
Hence B is at an end; call it place 1.

          B(1) – A(2) – 3 – 4

Because B has exactly one handsome neighbour, A is handsome (H).

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
5.  Handsomeness of the others

•  If the man in place 3 were handsome while the man in place 4 were
not, he would have exactly one handsome neighbour (A) and would rival
B.  
•  If the man in place 3 were the only non-handsome man, A would then
have exactly one handsome neighbour, again contradicting B’s
uniqueness.

The only possibility that avoids a second “exactly one” is  

          H            ¬H            H
          B(1) –  A(2) –  D(3) –  C(4)
(i.e. A and C are handsome, B and D are not).

Now the handsome-neighbour counts are

B : 1  (A)  
A : 0  (neighbours not handsome)  
D : 2  (A and C)  
C : 0  (neighbour not handsome)

So B is indeed the only man with exactly one handsome neighbour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
6.  Fixing the scars

Because the two end–men (B and C) are not Cliff (C is at 4), each of
them must have exactly one scarred neighbour.
Therefore A is scarred (to give B his single scarred neighbour) and D
is un-scarred (so that C has 0 scarred neighbours and is the exceptional
man of the statement).

To make A have exactly one scarred neighbour, his
other neighbour D must be un-scarred, and to give D exactly one scarred
neighbour B must be scarred.  Summarising:

B : S   A : S   D : ¬S   C : ¬S  

Counting scarred neighbours:

B : 1  (A)  
A : 1  (B)  
D : 1  (A)  
C : 0  (D)

So Cliff really is the only man whose number of scarred neighbours is
not 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
7.  Fair or not-fair?

The neighbours of A (positions 1 and 3) have to be ¬F by the very first
statement, so B and D are not fair.  No condition forbids anyone else
from being fair, so we may (and do) take A and C to be fair.

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
8.  Who is fair, handsome and un-scarred?

Attributes obtained:

B : ¬F, ¬H,  S  
A :  F,  H,  S  
D : ¬F, ¬H, ¬S  
C :  F,  H, ¬S

Exactly one man possesses all three required properties F & H & ¬S,

249,"Mad Ade's rich uncle ""Uncle Rich"" owned the famous Madadian Race horse breeding stables ""The Gluepot"".
It has a private race track that has five lanes.
Uncle Rich has 25 horses and wishes to know which are the three fastest.
What is the least number of races needed to be run to find the answer?
Note that it is only the ranking of the horses being found not the actual timings.",Subgroups!,"Let  

A = {A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄, A₅ }  
B = {B₁, B₂, B₃, B₄, B₅ }  
C = {C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄, C₅ }  
D = {D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, D₅ }  
E = {E₁, E₂, E₃, E₄, E₅ }  

be the 25 horses, the sub-script 1 denoting the fastest in its set, 2 the next fastest, etc.  
The track has 5 lanes, so at most 5 horses can run at once, and the only information obtained from a race is the order in which the five starters finish.

Step 1.  Five preliminary races (Races 1–5).  
Race each set once, obtaining the internal orders  

A₁<A₂<A₃<A₄<A₅, … , E₁<E₂<E₃<E₄<E₅.  

No fewer than five races suffice to see every horse even once, because 25÷5 = 5.

Step 2.  Race of the five heat-winners (Race 6).  
Start A₁, B₁, C₁, D₁, E₁ together.  Suppose the result is  

A₁ < B₁ < C₁ < D₁ < E₁.  

So group A is the fastest group, B the next, etc.

What horses can still be among the overall fastest three?

• A₁, A₂, A₃            (the three quickest in the fastest group)  
• B₁, B₂                (the two quickest in the second-fastest group)  
• C₁                    (the quickest in the third-fastest group)

No other horse can reach the overall top three:

– Anything behind A₃ in group A is slower than A₃.  
– Anything behind B₂ in group B is slower than B₂.  
– Every horse in groups D and E is slower than D₁ or E₁, which in turn are already proved slower than A₁, B₁ and C₁.  

Thus exactly six horses (A₁, A₂, A₃, B₁, B₂, C₁) still matter.

Step 3.  Tie-breaker race of the six remaining candidates (Race 7).  
Run those six; the first three to finish are necessarily the three fastest horses overall.

Total number of races used: 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Why 7 is minimal.  
After the first five heats you have seen every horse once but cannot yet compare horses from different heats.  
At that moment at least five horses (the heat-winners) are still possible overall winners.  To decide the winner you must race them together, giving Race 6.  
Even after that race there remain at least six logical candidates for the top three, as shown above; a single track can host only five at a time, so one more race is unavoidable.  
Therefore no procedure can ever finish in fewer than 7 races, and the construction above attains that bound.
