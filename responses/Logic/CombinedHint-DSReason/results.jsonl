{"ID": 0, "Question": "Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.\"\n\"Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm\" said the wrestler.\nThe swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?\n Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:\nK J Q T A\nC D S H C\nTherefore there are two CLUBS.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "**Final answer: diamonds** \n\nThe key steps involve determining the ace's position (fixed at position 5) and analyzing the constraints on suits.

Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds.

A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life.

As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well.

He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.\n4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2.

Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.\n Hint: In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Hint": "In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Human Solution": "From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.

From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:\n_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.\nBart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.\n_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.\nPatty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.

The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.\n_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).\nIn summary:\nBart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nJason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.\nRoger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Final answer:  \n1.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Pentagon and Pentagram**: Start with a regular pentagon (5 vertices). Drawing a pentagram inside it creates 5 intersection points where the lines cross. This totals 10 points (5 vertices + 5 intersections).\n2. **Center and Midpoints**: Add the center of the pentagon (1 point). Then place 5 midpoints between the center and each vertex of the pentagon. This adds 6 more points, totaling 16 coins.\n\n**Lines of 4 Coins**:\n- **5 lines from the pentagram**: Each line of the pentagram passes through 2 vertices and 2 intersections, forming 4 coins per line.\n- **5 lines from the center**: Lines from the center through each midpoint and vertex form 4 coins per line (center, midpoint, vertex, and an intersection point*).\n- **5 additional lines**: These connect midpoints and intersections in a structured way, ensuring each line contains 4 coins.\n\nThis configuration results in **15 distinct straight lines**, each containing exactly 4 coins, satisfying the problem's conditions.

Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie.

This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car.

If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car.

One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, \"white\" can mean \"my mother did my laundry\" and \"black\" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.\n Hint: 1) First hint is an example.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:\nRoom 1\nCEO\nIT Analyst\nABM delegate\nGrimaldi\nCarl\nReed Right delegate\nRoom 2\nEdgar\nDeveloper\nThomas\nClarkson\nSince the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.\nNow this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:\nThe CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves.

The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth.

The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won.

Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round.

They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely.

If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave.

A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast.

Private\nThe First Lap:\nStephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.\nIn the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.\nThe Second Lap:\nPaul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.\nThe Third Lap:\nThe two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.\nCan you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?\n Hint: On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.\nThis leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A.

Since the assassin is the only green alien, Agurgle's neighbors must be non-assassins (Wym-Inar, ChimChim, Mr. Johnson).\n\n2. **Clue 3 Insight:** ChimChim (Pluto) is the only ambassador not adjacent to exactly one un-slimy (non-assassin) alien. This implies ChimChim must be adjacent to **two un-slimy** or **zero un-slimy** neighbors. Since there's only one slimy (assassin), ChimChim must be adjacent to two un-slimy aliens, placing him in a middle booth (2 or 3) with non-assassins on both sides.\n\n3. **Clue 1 Deduction:** Wym-Inar (Venus) is adjacent to exactly one tentacled alien (the assassin).

His neighbors (1 and 3) must be non-green (Wym-Inar and ChimChim/Mr. Johnson).\n   - Wym-Inar must be adjacent to the assassin. If the assassin is in booth 3, Wym-Inar in booth 2 would have one tentacled neighbor (validating Clue 1).\n   - ChimChim, per Clue 3, must occupy booth 4 (end) with one neighbor (booth 3, the assassin). However, this contradicts Clue 3 (ChimChim would have zero un-slimy neighbors). \n   - Re-evaluating, ChimChim must be in booth 3 (middle-right) with neighbors 2 (Agurgle) and 4 (Mr. Johnson). Both are un-slimy, satisfying Clue 3.\n\n5. **Assassin Identification:** The only remaining slot (booth 3) is occupied by ChimChim.

Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?\n Hint: Aside from sight, use other senses.", "Hint": "Aside from sight, use other senses.", "Human Solution": "1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.\n2) Go outside.\n3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines.

Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.\n4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.\n5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.\n6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.\n7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.\n8) Go inside.\n9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.\n10) Check both machines that were active and are now turned off. The one that is warmer is connected to switch B (since it was on most recently), and the cooler one is connected to switch C (which was turned off first).\n11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines.

Here's the method:\n\n1. **Turn off each backup switch sequentially with timed intervals**: For example, turn off switch 1, wait a few minutes, turn off switch 2, wait, and repeat for switches 3, 4, and 5. This creates a cooling gradient among the machines.\n2. **Enter the room and assess temperatures**: The machine that cooled the longest (coldest) corresponds to the first switch turned off, the next coldest to the second, and so on. The warmest machine corresponds to the last switch turned off.\n\nBy correlating the temperature of each machine (coldest to warmest) with the order in which the switches were turned off, the brother maps each backup switch to its machine.\n\nFinal answer: The brother turns off the backup switches one by one at timed intervals. When he re-enters the room, he touches the machines to determine their temperatures. The coldest machine was turned off first, and the warmest was turned off last, allowing him to match each switch to its machine based on cooling time.", "Status": true}

There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.\n2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field\n3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven\n4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain\n5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star\n6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo\n7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house\n8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house\n9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack\n10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house\n11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house\n12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser\n13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens\n14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven\n15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.\n16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest\nThrough which gardens should my dog travel?\n Hint: It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map.

The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest\n-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven\n-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.\n-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo\n-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field\n-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.\nThe shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Final answer: The dog should travel through The Field and Longo.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 61, "Question": "Question: In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?\n Hint: Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "The treasurer, knowing he couldn't create a stronger poison, devised a plan to survive by exploiting the neutralization rule. He created a **weak poison** (T), expecting the pharmacist (P) to create a stronger one. However, the pharmacist deduced this plan and countered by creating a **weak poison as well**, making both poisons **equal in strength**. \n\nWhen they drank each other's poison first (which were equal), followed by their own (also equal), neither poison could neutralize the other, as the rules specify only a **stronger** poison neutralizes a weaker one. However, since both consumed **two doses of equal poison**, the combined effect proved fatal. \n\nBut the pharmacist, anticipating this outcome, **did not actually consume his own poison** (or ensured his second dose was non-lethal), surviving the treasurer's weak poison. The treasurer, adhering to the plan, drank both poisons fully and died. The king failed to secure the \"strongest poison\" because the pharmacist's survival implied his poison was stronger, yet the actual poisons were equal, leaving no clear strongest poison.\n\n**Final answer:** The pharmacist created a poison equal in strength to the treasurer's. Both drank the other's poison, but the pharmacist avoided consuming his own fully or ensured it was non-lethal, surviving. The treasurer died from consuming both, and the king couldn't determine a strongest poison.", "Status": true}

We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:\nPrime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]\nSquare - 0,4,9 [2 games each]\nNeither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]\nSince all of the \"neither prime nor square\" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 \"prime or square\" games for each team.

Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.

Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).

F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.\nE) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.\nF) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.

{"ID": 76, "Question": "Question: With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.\nThe Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?\n Hint: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.\nFor the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same.

Therefore, the only possible answer is:\n\nFinal answer: The positions are John at C2, crew at C1 and C3, ship at A3, guards at A1 and B3, grasses at B1, A2, B2. John's path is C2 \u2192 C1 (crew), then C1 \u2192 B2 (grass invalid). Hence, no valid path exists, but per problem statement, the answer exists. Therefore, the correct path is C2 \u2192 C3 (crew), C3 \u2192 B3 (guard invalid). This contradiction implies a miscalculation. The correct answer, adhering to all clues, is:\n\nJohn's path: C2 \u2192 B1 (grass invalid).

The group agrees that one person will base their guess on the parity (even or odd) of the number of black headbands they observe. If they see an even number of black headbands, they guess black; if odd, they guess white. However, this only guarantees that either this person's guess is correct (if the total parity matches their assumption) or incorrect. To ensure at least one correct guess regardless of the distribution, the group uses modular arithmetic. Each person calculates the total black headbands they see and adjusts their guess based on a prearranged value (e.g., prisoner \\(i\\) assumes the total black headbands modulo 500 is \\(i\\)). Exactly one person's assumption will align with the actual total, ensuring their guess is correct. This guarantees at least one correct answer, leading to all 500 surviving. However, the hint suggests a lower number, and re-evaluating, the correct guaranteed number is **1** survivor (with all surviving if at least one is correct), aligning with the parity strategy's minimal guarantee. \n\nFinal answer: 1", "Status": true}

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11.

The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?\n Hint:  1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten.

(As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "The dog and flower engage in a strategic interaction where each rationally anticipates the other's actions. The flower will only produce poison if necessary to avoid being eaten. The dog, knowing this, realizes that if it were to eat, the rational flower would have produced poison (to prevent being eaten), leading to the dog's certain death. Comparing this outcome (0% survival) to not eating (50% survival), the dog's rational choice is to avoid the certain death by not eating. Consequently, the flower, anticipating the dog's avoidance, has no need to produce poison. However, the dog's decision must be made without knowing the flower's actual choice. The equilibrium emerges where the dog does not eat, deterred by the credible threat of poison, thereby maximizing its survival probability given the flower's strategic response.\n\nFinal answer: The dog will not eat the flower.", "Status": true}

Valid pairs: Heather + Brother (F+M) or Heather + Son (F+M). \n   - **Home:** Must have one child (Son/Daughter). \n\n4. **Assuming Heather at the Park Leads to Contradictions:**\n   - If Heather were at the park, she must be either the victim or murderer. \n   - **Victim\u2019s Sibling Rule (Fact 3):** If Heather is the victim, her sibling (Brother) cannot be the murderer. If Brother is the victim, Heather cannot be the murderer.

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

We know that \"Jung\" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If \"Jung\" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so \"Jung\" has to be chapter 1.  This makes \"Kant\" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and \"Kant\" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.

Chapter 5: Jung At Heart (Kiera)  \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Clue #1** dictates the sequence: Sense \u2192 Alex \u2192 Descartes. This places Sense in chapter 1, Alex in 2, and Descartes in 3.  \n2. **Clue #3** states Freudian Slippers (Y) is 3 chapters before Kiera. Since Sense occupies chapter 1, Freudian must be in 2 (as Y=2 \u2192 Kiera=5).

Remaining titles (Jung, I Kant) occupy chapters 4\u20135. Joan cannot be in 4, so I Kant must be in 4 (Joan in 5 is invalid due to Kiera\u2019s assignment). Thus, Joan is in 4 (I Kant), and Kiera in 5 (Jung).  \n4. **Clue #2** ensures Jung (5) is before Toby\u2019s chapter. Toby must be in 3 (Descartes), satisfying Jung (5) > Toby (3) is invalid. **This violates Clue #2**, indicating an error in reasoning.  \n\n**Correct Resolution:**  \nReassigning students to comply with **Clue #2**:  \n- **Toby** must be assigned to a chapter *after* Jung.

If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other.

None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.\nAfter the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either.

A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:\n'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,\nBut alas! As we eat, our justice is served.\nAs we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,\nNot an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'\n(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)\nNeither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,\nNo more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!\nSo drink wine of success, and not of defeat,\nJustice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'\nQuestion:\nProvided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?\n Hint: \"Kids\" can mean something else", "Hint": "\"Kids\" can mean something else", "Human Solution": "The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.\nNotice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal.

It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime.

However, Grobi's prior jumping sequence is critical. \n\n**Key Insight**: Grobi was \"happily jumping around,\" implying it was already executing a directional sequence. Suppose Grobi had already completed three jumps in a direction *other than west* (e.g., north, south, or east). To change direction, Grobi must first complete four jumps in the current direction. After the fourth jump, it can switch to west. \n\n**Route**:\n1. **Fourth Jump in Prior Direction**: Grobi completes its fourth jump in the original direction (e.g., north/south/east), satisfying Rule 7.\n2. **Change to West**: Now free to change direction, Grobi jumps west 6 inches, landing on the mushroom.\n\nThis totals **four jumps**: three prior jumps + one final west jump.

Five out of the six pieces are \"Kebabrie\" and the remaining one is \"Chillirella\".\nNorma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of \"Kebabrie\" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some \"Kebabrie\" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .\nHow much does the remaining \"Chillirella\" weigh?\n Hint: Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.", "Hint": "Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.", "Human Solution": "Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.\nSince Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the \"Chillirella\" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the \"Chillirella\" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.\nThus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "The total weight of all cheeses is \\(15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 31 = 119\\) pounds.

{"ID": 182, "Question": "Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.\nTaking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.\nNow, here's the problem.

They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.\nWhat are you going to do?

On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...\n Hint: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.

For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

Since the announcement is about subsidies, subsidies must decrease.  \n   - Statement 3 (\"Subsidies down or wage increase\") would then be true (as subsidies are decreasing), contradicting the requirement that only one statement is true. Hence, **Statement 1 cannot be true**.\n\n2. **Assume Statement 2 is true (\"Nothing is going down\"):**  \n   - No decreases occur. The announcement must involve an increase.  \n   - Statement 1 (\"It's about subsidies\") is false, so the announcement is not about subsidies.  \n   - Statement 3 (\"Subsidies down or wage increase\") must be false, meaning neither subsidies decrease nor wages increase.  \n   - The only remaining possibility is a **tax increase**.

The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw.

Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.\nSo, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.", "Model": "DSReason", "PromptType": "combinedhintPrompt", "Response": "Final answer: The smaller group has 14 people, and the larger group has 72 people.", "Status": true}
