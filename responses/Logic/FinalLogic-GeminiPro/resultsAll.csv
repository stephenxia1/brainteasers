0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"This problem is a variation of the classic ""prisoners and light switch"" puzzle. Here, there are N=23 prisoners. There are two light switches, A and B, initially both OFF. Each time a prisoner visits the switch room, they must flip exactly one switch. The goal is for a prisoner to declare ""We have all visited the switch room"" if and only if it's true.

Here's a strategy that the prisoners can agree upon:

**1. Roles Assignment:**
   - Designate one prisoner as the ""Counter"".
   - The other N-1 = 22 prisoners are ""Workers"".

**2. Switch Assignment and Initial State:**
   - Switch B will be used as the ""signal switch"". Workers use it to indicate they have visited.
   - Switch A will be used as an ""auxiliary switch"". It is flipped when the protocol doesn't require flipping switch B, simply to satisfy the ""must flip one switch"" rule.
   - The initial state of the switches is (A=OFF, B=OFF).

**3. Counter's Internal State:**
   - The Counter must keep an internal count of how many workers have signaled. Let's call this `workers_counted`. Initially, `workers_counted = 0`.

**4. Worker's Internal State:**
   - Each Worker must remember if they have successfully signaled their presence before. Let's call this personal flag `i_have_signaled`. Initially, `i_have_signaled = false` for all workers.

**5. Protocol for the Counter:**
   When the Counter enters the switch room:
   a. Check the state of switch B.
   b. If switch B is ON:
      i. Increment `workers_counted` by 1.
      ii. Flip switch B to OFF. (This is the one flip for this visit).
   c. If switch B is OFF:
      i. Flip switch A. (This is the one flip for this visit). `workers_counted` remains unchanged.
   d. After performing the action, if `workers_counted` == N-1 (which is 22 for this problem):
      i. Declare: ""We have all visited the switch room.""

**6. Protocol for a Worker:**
   When a Worker enters the switch room:
   a. Check the state of switch B and their personal `i_have_signaled` flag.
   b. If switch B is OFF AND `i_have_signaled` is false:
      i. Flip switch B to ON. (This is the one flip for this visit).
      ii. Set their personal `i_have_signaled` flag to true. (They have now signaled their first visit).
   c. Else (meaning either switch B is ON, or `i_have_signaled` is true, or both):
      i. Flip switch A. (This is the one flip for this visit).

**Reasoning for why this strategy works:**

*   **Signaling Visit:** Each worker needs to signal their visit to the counter. A worker signals by changing switch B from OFF to ON. Crucially, each worker does this only once, thanks to their `i_have_signaled` flag. Once a worker has set B to ON, on any subsequent visit they will find either B ON (their signal or another's is pending) or B OFF (their signal was counted) AND their `i_have_signaled` flag will be true. In these cases, they will flip switch A, leaving switch B for other workers or the counter.
*   **Counting Signals:** The Counter's job is to count these signals. When the Counter finds switch B ON, it means a worker has signaled. The Counter then increments their `workers_counted` and turns B OFF, making B available for the next worker to signal. If B is already OFF when the Counter visits, it means no worker has signaled since the last time B was turned OFF (or it's the beginning). In this case, the Counter flips switch A.
*   **Correctness of Declaration:** The Counter makes the declaration when `workers_counted` reaches N-1 (22). This means the Counter has observed N-1 distinct workers turning switch B ON. Each of these N-1 workers must have visited the switch room at least once to turn B ON. The Counter themself has also visited the room (multiple times, to count all signals). Therefore, when the Counter makes the declaration, all N (23) prisoners have indeed visited the switch room.
*   **""Must Flip One Switch"" Rule:** The strategy ensures every prisoner flips exactly one switch on every visit. Switch A serves as the ""sacrificial"" switch when the main protocol logic for switch B doesn't apply to the current visitor. The state of switch A is irrelevant to the counting logic.
*   **Initial State:** The known initial state (A=OFF, B=OFF) is important. B being OFF means no signals are pending at the start, and `workers_counted` is correctly 0.
*   **Liveness (Progress):** The warden's guarantee (""given enough time, everyone will eventually visit ... as many times as everyone else"") ensures the protocol will make progress:
    *   If there's an unsignaled worker, they will eventually visit the room. If B is OFF when they visit, they will turn it ON. If B is ON, they will flip A and wait for a future turn.
    *   If B is ON (a worker has signaled), the Counter will eventually visit to process the signal, increment the count, and turn B OFF.
    *   This prevents scenarios like B staying ON indefinitely (blocking new signals if the Counter never comes) or B staying OFF indefinitely (if unsignaled workers are never chosen).

**Example walk-through (N=3, Counter needs to count 2):**
Initial: (A=OFF, B=OFF). Counter.count=0. W1.signaled=false, W2.signaled=false.

1.  W1 visits. B is OFF, W1.signaled=false. W1 flips B to ON. W1.signaled=true. State: (A=OFF, B=ON).
2.  W2 visits. B is ON. W2.signaled=false. W2 flips A. State: (A=ON, B=ON). (W2 still needs to signal).
3.  Counter visits. B is ON. Counter.count becomes 1. Counter flips B to OFF. State: (A=ON, B=OFF).
4.  W1 visits. B is OFF, W1.signaled=true. W1 flips A. State: (A=OFF, B=OFF).
5.  W2 visits. B is OFF, W2.signaled=false. W2 flips B to ON. W2.signaled=true. State: (A=OFF, B=ON).

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

The P.S. section says:
""Isaac Newton:
Near orange bags lying east.
Gets as strange equally slowly.""

Let's look at the first letters of each word in the lines following ""Isaac Newton"":

1.  ""**N**ear **o**range **b**ags **l**ying **e**ast.""
    Taking the first letter of each word gives: N O B L E

2.  ""**G**ets **a**s **s**trange **e**qually **s**lowly.""
    Taking the first letter of each word gives: G A S E S

Putting these together, we get ""NOBLE GASES"".
Isaac Newton was a scientist, and Noble Gases are a group of chemical elements. This connection seems strong.

The Noble Gases are:
*   Helium (He)
*   Neon (Ne)
*   Argon (Ar)
*   Krypton (Kr)
*   Xenon (Xe)
*   Radon (Rn)
*   (Oganesson (Og) - more recently discovered/synthesized)

Now, we need to relate this to the rest of the postcard. The postcard states:
""A relative of mine was expelled.
It was my niece.
Wouldn't you agree?
It was because she joined a band of bikers.
She's doing lots of things wrong.
She always shows a lot of toughness.""

The line ""It was my niece."" seems particularly highlighted.
Let's look at the word ""niece"".
N I E C E

Which of the Noble Gases could be related to ""niece""?
The letters N and E are prominent in ""niece"".
The Noble Gas NEON has the chemical symbol Ne.
The word ""Neon"" itself uses the letters N and E from ""niece"".

Let's consider the line ""Near orange bags lying east.""
The acrostic is NOBLE. The word ""orange"" is interesting. Neon gas, when electrically excited in a tube (like in a neon sign), glows a distinct reddish-orange color. This could be a subtle hint confirming Neon.

So, the P.S. leads us to the category ""Noble Gases"".
The main text, specifically ""It was my niece"", points to ""Neon"" (containing N and E from niece, and Ne being its symbol).
The ""orange"" in the P.S. could also hint at the color of neon signs.

The password is likely one of the noble gases, and ""Neon"" fits best with the clue ""my niece"" and the subtle hint of ""orange"".

Let's assemble the logic:
1.  The P.S. is the key.
2.  The lines attributed to Isaac Newton:
    *   ""Near orange bags lying east"" -> First letters spell N.O.B.L.E.
    *   ""Gets as strange equally slowly"" -> First letters spell G.A.S.E.S.
3.  This gives ""NOBLE GASES"", a scientific category appropriate for a clue associated with Isaac Newton.
4.  The main body of the postcard emphasizes ""It was my niece.""
5.  The word ""niece"" contains the letters N and E.
6.  Among the noble gases, NEON (symbol Ne) directly relates to these letters.
7.  A supporting hint: ""orange"" in ""Near orange bags lying east"" could allude to the characteristic reddish-orange glow of neon in discharge tubes.

Therefore, the password seems to be NEON.

Final answer: NEON",True

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.
A) H can not be 8.  C can not be 1.  C can not be 0.  B can not be 9.  D can not be 1.  D can not be 2.  F can not be 1.

4.  **The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.** (So we have a Green-White block)
5.  **The green house's owner drinks coffee.**
    Possible positions for Green-White:
    *   H1(Green)-H2(White): No, H2 is Blue.
    *   H2(Green)-H3(White): No, H2 is Blue.
    *   H3(Green)-H4(White): If H3 is Green, its owner drinks Coffee. But H3 drinks Milk (Clue 8). So this is not possible.
    *   H4(Green)-H5(White): This is the only option. So H4 is Green, H5 is White. H4 owner drinks Coffee.

1.  **The Brit lives in the red house.**
    *   If H1 is Red, then Brit lives in H1. But Norwegian lives in H1 (Clue 9). Impossible.
    *   Therefore, H3 must be Red, and the Brit lives in H3.
    This means H1 must be the remaining color, Yellow.

    We need a (Cigar, Pet) slot. Brit (H3) is a candidate. If so, Brit smokes Pall Mall and rears birds.
    Other houses with unknown (Cigar, Pet): H1 (Dunhill, ?), H2 (?, Horse), H4 (?, ?), H5 (?, ?).
    So it must be H3 (Brit), H4, or H5.

12. **The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.**
    We need a (Cigar, Beverage) slot.
    Possible houses: H2 (Bev ?, Cigar ?), H5 (Bev ?, Cigar ?). H1 Bev is unknown but Cigar is Dunhill.
    Let's hold this.

3.  **The Dane drinks tea.**
    We need a (Nationality, Beverage) slot.
    Possible houses: H2 (Nat ?, Bev ?), H5 (Nat ?, Bev ?).
    Let's combine this with clue 12.
    Beverages: Tea, Coffee, Milk, Beer, Water. Used: Milk (H3), Coffee (H4). Remaining: Tea, Beer, Water.
    Case A: Dane/Tea in H2. Then Bluemasters/Beer must be in H5. Water is left for H1.
    Case B: Dane/Tea in H5. Then Bluemasters/Beer must be in H2. Water is left for H1.

    Let's test Case A:
    H2: Dane, Tea.
    H5: Drinks Beer, Smokes Bluemasters.
    H1: Drinks Water (only remaining beverage for H1).

13. **The German smokes Prince.**
    Nationalities remaining for H4, H5: German, Swede.
    Cigars remaining for H2, H4: Blends, Prince (H5 has Bluemasters from Case A).
    Since German smokes Prince, German/Prince must be H4. (Cannot be H2 because Dane is in H2).
    H4: German, Prince.
    This implies the remaining nationality (Swede) is in H5.
    And the remaining cigar (Blends) is in H2.
    Let's update the table for Case A:

2.  **The Swede keeps dogs as pets.**
    In Case A, the Swede is in H5. So H5 keeps Dogs.

    Pets used: Horse (H2), Birds (H3), Dogs (H5). Remaining: Cats, Fish. For H1, H4.

    Let's quickly check if Case B was viable:
    If Dane/Tea in H5. H2 drinks Beer, smokes Bluemasters. H1 drinks Water.
    H5: Dane, Tea. H2: Beer, Bluemasters.
    German smokes Prince. Nationalities for H2, H4: German, Swede.
    So German/Prince must be H4. (Cannot be H2 because H2 has Bluemasters).
    H4: German, Prince.
    This implies Swede in H2.
    Table for Case B start:
    | Category     | House 1   | House 2         | House 3   | House 4 | House 5 |
    |--------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|---------|---------|

    | Cigar        | Dunhill   | Bluemasters     | Pall Mall | Prince  | Blends  |
    Clue 2: The Swede keeps dogs as pets. Swede is in H2. So H2 keeps dogs.
    But we already know H2 keeps Horse (from Clue 11). A house cannot have two pets.
    So Case B is impossible. Case A is the correct path.

    Continuing with Case A (our current main table):
    Pets remaining for H1 and H4 are Cats and Fish.

10. **The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.**
    The owner who smokes Blends is in H2 (Dane).
    The neighbors of H2 are H1 and H3.
    H3 has Birds.
    So H1 must be the one who keeps cats.
    | Category     | House 1   | House 2 | House 3   | House 4 | House 5       |

    The only remaining pet is Fish. The only remaining pet slot is H4.
    So, H4 owner keeps Fish. The owner of H4 is the German.

15. **The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.**
    The owner who smokes Blends is in H2.
    Neighbors are H1 and H3.
    H1 drinks Water. This is consistent with our table.
    H3 drinks Milk.
    This clue confirms our deduction that H1 drinks Water.

All clues have been used and the table is complete.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?
Looking at the table, the Fish is in House 4, and the owner of House 4 is the German.

Let's double check all conditions with the final table:
1.  The Brit lives in the red house. (H3: Brit, Red) - Check.
2.  The Swede keeps dogs as pets. (H5: Swede, Dogs) - Check.
3.  The Dane drinks tea. (H2: Dane, Tea) - Check.
4.  The green house is on the immediate left of the white house. (H4 Green, H5 White) - Check.
5.  The green house's owner drinks coffee. (H4 Green, Coffee) - Check.
6.  The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. (H3 Pall Mall, Birds) - Check.
7.  The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. (H1 Yellow, Dunhill) - Check.
8.  The owner living in the center house drinks milk. (H3 Milk) - Check.
9.  The Norwegian lives in the first house. (H1 Norwegian) - Check.
10. The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. (H2 Blends, next to H1 Cats) - Check.
11. The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill. (H2 Horse, next to H1 Dunhill) - Check.
12. The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer. (H5 Bluemasters, Beer) - Check.
13. The German smokes Prince. (H4 German, Prince) - Check.
14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. (H1 Norwegian, next to H2 Blue) - Check.
15. The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water. (H2 Blends, next to H1 Water) - Check.

All conditions are satisfied. The German owns the fish.

Final answer: The German",True
16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)
15, 16, 17, 24, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True
20,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"The optimal strategy relies on the last person in line (P10, who sees 9 hats) conveying a crucial piece of information to the others, at the cost of their own guess being only 50% accurate. All other 9 people can then determine their hat color with 100% certainty.

Here's the strategy:

**1. The Agreement (Made the Night Before):**
The 10 people agree on the following:
*   They will assign a numerical value to hat colors: Black = 1, White = 0.
*   The last person in line (P10) will observe the hats of the 9 people in front (P1 to P9). P10 will calculate the sum of the values of these 9 hats (i.e., count the number of black hats).
*   P10 will use their guess to communicate the *parity* of this sum (whether the number of black hats P10 sees is even or odd).
    *   If P10 sees an **odd** number of black hats on P1-P9, P10 will guess their own hat is ""**black**"".
    *   If P10 sees an **even** number of black hats on P1-P9, P10 will guess their own hat is ""**white**"".
    *   This guess by P10 for their *own* hat has a 50% chance of being correct, as P10 has no information about their own hat.

**2. Execution of the Strategy:**

*   **Person 10 (P10 - sees 9 hats):**
    *   Counts the number of black hats on P1 through P9.
    *   If the count is odd, P10 announces ""black"" as the guess for their own hat.
    *   If the count is even, P10 announces ""white"" as the guess for their own hat.
    *   P10 has a 50% chance of survival. Everyone else hears P10's guess. Let's call the parity P10 announced `TargetParity` (0 for even/""white"", 1 for odd/""black"").

*   **Person 9 (P9 - sees 8 hats):**
    *   P9 heard P10's guess. P9 now knows the `TargetParity` of black hats P10 saw on P1-P9. For example, if P10 said ""black"", P9 knows the sum of black hats on P1-P9 was odd.
    *   P9 looks at the hats of P1 through P8 and counts the number of black hats they see. Let this be `Sum_P9_sees`.
    *   P9 calculates the parity of `Sum_P9_sees`. Let this be `Parity_P9_sees`.
    *   P9 can now determine their own hat color. The sum of black hats P10 saw is `Sum_P9_sees + (P9's hat color)`. The parity of this sum must equal `TargetParity`.
        *   In terms of parity: `(Parity_P9_sees XOR P9's_hat_parity) = TargetParity`.
        *   Therefore, `P9's_hat_parity = (TargetParity XOR Parity_P9_sees)`.
    *   If `P9's_hat_parity` is 1 (odd), P9's hat is black. P9 announces ""black"".
    *   If `P9's_hat_parity` is 0 (even), P9's hat is white. P9 announces ""white"".
    *   P9's guess is 100% correct. P9 survives. Everyone hears P9's guess and sees P9 survive, confirming P9's hat color.

*   **Person 8 (P8 - sees 7 hats):**
    *   P8 heard P10's guess (knows `TargetParity`).
    *   P8 heard P9's guess and knows P9 survived. So, P8 knows P9's actual hat color (let its parity be `H9_parity`).
    *   P8 looks at the hats of P1 through P7 and counts the number of black hats. Let this be `Sum_P8_sees`.
    *   P8 calculates the parity of `Sum_P8_sees`. Let this be `Parity_P8_sees`.
    *   P8 knows that the parity of the sum of black hats on P1-P9 is `TargetParity`. This sum can be broken down: `(Sum_P8_sees) + (P8's hat color) + (P9's hat color)`.
    *   In terms of parity: `(Parity_P8_sees XOR P8's_hat_parity XOR H9_parity) = TargetParity`.
    *   Therefore, `P8's_hat_parity = (TargetParity XOR Parity_P8_sees XOR H9_parity)`.
    *   P8 determines their hat color based on `P8's_hat_parity` and announces it.
    *   P8's guess is 100% correct. P8 survives. Everyone hears P8's guess and sees P8 survive.

*   **General Case for Person k (P(k), where k ranges from 9 down to 1):**
    *   P(k) has heard P10's guess, so they know the `TargetParity` (the parity of black hats on P1 through P9).
    *   P(k) has heard the guesses of P(k+1) through P9 and knows they all survived. Thus, P(k) knows the actual hat colors (and their parities) for P(k+1) through P9. Let `Parity_Known_Hats_Behind = (H(k+1)_parity XOR H(k+2)_parity XOR ... XOR H9_parity)`. For P9, this sum is empty, so its parity is 0.
    *   P(k) looks at the hats of P1 through P(k-1). P(k) counts the black hats they see. Let `Parity_Visible_Hats_Front = (parity of black hats on P1 through P(k-1))`. For P1, this sum is empty, so its parity is 0.
    *   P(k) knows: `(Parity_Visible_Hats_Front XOR P(k)'s_hat_parity XOR Parity_Known_Hats_Behind) = TargetParity`.
    *   Therefore, `P(k)'s_hat_parity = (TargetParity XOR Parity_Visible_Hats_Front XOR Parity_Known_Hats_Behind)`.
    *   P(k) determines their hat color based on `P(k)'s_hat_parity` and announces it.
    *   P(k)'s guess is 100% correct. P(k) survives.

**3. Outcome:**
*   Person 10 has a 50% chance of survival.
*   Persons 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 will all be able to determine their hat color with 100% certainty and will survive.

**Survival Rate:**
*   **Guaranteed survivors:** 9 people (P1 to P9).
*   **Probabilistic survivor:** 1 person (P10) with a 50% chance.
*   This means in the best case, all 10 survive. In the worst case, 9 survive.
*   The expected number of survivors is 9 + 0.5*1 = 9.5.

This is the optimal strategy because:
1.  The first person to guess (P10) has no information about their own hat color. Thus, any guess they make about their own hat has at best a 50% chance of being correct (assuming random hat distribution).
2.  P10's single word guess (""white"" or ""black"") can convey one bit of information. The parity of the hats they see is exactly one bit of information.
3.  This one bit of information is sufficient to allow every subsequent person to deduce their hat color with certainty.

Final answer: The strategy is as follows:
1.  All 10 people agree beforehand that ""black"" means ""odd"" and ""white"" means ""even"" when spoken by the first guesser (P10).
2.  P10 (last in line, sees 9 hats) counts the number of black hats on the 9 people in front.
    *   If this number is odd, P10 guesses their own hat is ""black"" (conveying ""odd"" to the others).
    *   If this number is even, P10 guesses their own hat is ""white"" (conveying ""even"" to the others).
    P10 has a 50% chance of survival.
3.  Let the parity P10 conveyed be `TargetParity` (1 for odd/black, 0 for even/white).
4.  Each subsequent person P(k) (from P9 down to P1):
    a. Knows `TargetParity` from P10's announcement.
    b. Knows the actual hat colors of P(k+1) to P9 (because they announced their correct color and survived). Let `Parity_Known_Hats_Behind` be the parity of the sum of black hats from P(k+1) to P9.
    c. Observes the hats P1 to P(k-1). Let `Parity_Visible_Hats_Front` be the parity of the sum of black hats from P1 to P(k-1).
    d. Calculates their own hat's parity: `P(k)'s_hat_parity = (TargetParity XOR Parity_Visible_Hats_Front XOR Parity_Known_Hats_Behind)`.
    e. If `P(k)'s_hat_parity` is 1, they announce ""black"". If 0, they announce ""white"". This guess is 100% correct.
This strategy guarantees the survival of 9 people, and the 10th person (P10) has a 50% chance of survival. Thus, 9.5 people survive on average.",True
23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:30        Elena        0:50 later, 1:30 after Derec, 1:20 after Adele
7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).

Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.

1: M
2: A

The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.

27,"You roll five dice. The computer calculates the score. Your job is to find out what the computer based the score on.
If you roll 5, 4, 6, 3, and 5, the score is 10.
If you roll 1, 3, 3, 4, and 2, the score is 4.
If you roll 1, 6, 2, 6, and 4,the score is 0.
What is the method?",Think of the title. The score is never odd. Picture the dice in your head.,"Only the dice that have a centre dot are counted (3 and five). Count the number of dots around the centre dot. These ""petals"" are the score. A five on the die gets a score of 4, and a three on the die gets a score of 2.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Let's analyze the dice rolls and scores to find a pattern.

We are given:
1.  Roll: 5, 4, 6, 3, 5 -> Score: 10
2.  Roll: 1, 3, 3, 4, 2 -> Score: 4
3.  Roll: 1, 6, 2, 6, 4 -> Score: 0

Let's examine each roll for common features like pairs, straights, sums, etc.

**Roll 1: 5, 4, 6, 3, 5**
*   Sorted: 3, 4, 5, 5, 6
*   Sum: 5+4+6+3+5 = 23
*   Pairs: One pair of 5s.
*   Other dice (not in the pair): 3, 4, 6. Their sum is 3+4+6 = 13.
*   Score: 10.

**Roll 2: 1, 3, 3, 4, 2**
*   Sorted: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4
*   Sum: 1+3+3+4+2 = 13
*   Pairs: One pair of 3s.
*   Other dice (not in the pair): 1, 2, 4. Their sum is 1+2+4 = 7.
*   Score: 4.

**Roll 3: 1, 6, 2, 6, 4**
*   Sorted: 1, 2, 4, 6, 6
*   Sum: 1+6+2+6+4 = 19
*   Pairs: One pair of 6s.
*   Other dice (not in the pair): 1, 2, 4. Their sum is 1+2+4 = 7.
*   Score: 0.

Observations:
*   In all three examples, there is exactly one pair of identical dice. The other three dice are unique.
*   Let's assume the scoring method relies on this condition (exactly one pair).

Let's look at the relationship between the ""sum of other dice"" and the score for each case where there's one pair:

*   **Case 1 (Pair of 5s):**
    *   Dice in pair: 5, 5.
    *   Other dice: 3, 4, 6. Sum = 13.
    *   Score = 10.
    *   Difference: 13 - 10 = 3.

*   **Case 2 (Pair of 3s):**
    *   Dice in pair: 3, 3.
    *   Other dice: 1, 2, 4. Sum = 7.
    *   Score = 4.
    *   Difference: 7 - 4 = 3.

*   **Case 3 (Pair of 6s):**
    *   Dice in pair: 6, 6.
    *   Other dice: 1, 2, 4. Sum = 7.
    *   Score = 0.
    *   If we try the same pattern: (Sum of other dice) - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4. This is NOT 0.

This suggests that the pair of 6s might be a special case.

Let's formulate a hypothesis:
1.  The scoring method applies if there is exactly one pair of identical dice. If there are no pairs, two pairs, three-of-a-kind, etc., the score is 0 (this is an assumption, as no such examples are given, but it makes the rule more complete).
2.  If there is exactly one pair:
    a.  If the pair is two 6s, the score is 0.
    b.  If the pair is not two 6s (i.e., two 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s), the score is the sum of the other three (non-paired) dice, minus 3.

Let's test this hypothesis:

*   **Roll 1: 5, 4, 6, 3, 5**
    *   Is there exactly one pair? Yes, a pair of 5s.
    *   Is the pair 6s? No.
    *   Score = (sum of other three dice) - 3.
    *   Other dice: 4, 6, 3. Sum = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13.
    *   Score = 13 - 3 = 10. This matches.

*   **Roll 2: 1, 3, 3, 4, 2**
    *   Is there exactly one pair? Yes, a pair of 3s.
    *   Is the pair 6s? No.
    *   Score = (sum of other three dice) - 3.
    *   Other dice: 1, 4, 2. Sum = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.
    *   Score = 7 - 3 = 4. This matches.

*   **Roll 3: 1, 6, 2, 6, 4**
    *   Is there exactly one pair? Yes, a pair of 6s.
    *   Is the pair 6s? Yes.
    *   Score = 0. This matches.

The hypothesis holds for all given examples.

The method appears to be:
1.  Check if the five dice contain exactly one pair (i.e., two dice show the same number, and the other three dice all show different numbers from each other and from the pair).
2.  If this condition is not met (e.g., no pairs, two pairs, three-of-a-kind, etc.), the score is 0.
3.  If there is exactly one pair:
    a.  If the value of the dice in the pair is 6, the score is 0.
    b.  Otherwise (if the pair is 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s), the score is calculated by summing the values of the other three dice (the ones not forming the pair) and then subtracting 3 from this sum.

Final answer: The method is as follows:
1.  The computer first checks if there is exactly one pair among the five dice (meaning two dice show the same number, and the other three dice are all different from each other and from the paired number).
2.  If there is not exactly one pair (e.g., all dice are different, there are two pairs, three of a kind, etc.), the score is 0.
3.  If there is exactly one pair:
    a.  If the pair consists of two 6s, the score is 0.
    b.  If the pair consists of any other number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s), the score is the sum of the values of the other three dice (the ones not forming the pair), minus 3.",True
28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated","Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.

'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners.

    *   Historically and popularly, people refer to the **SEVEN** Seas (though modern oceanography has different divisions, the classic concept is strong in culture).
    *   Both of these point to the number **SEVEN**.

3.  **The incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____'**:

From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.

Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"This is a classic logic puzzle that relies on inductive reasoning and the concept of common knowledge.

Let's denote the day the Guru makes her statement as Day 0. The first night they can leave is Night 1, then Night 2, and so on.

The Guru's Statement: ""I see a person with blue eyes.""
What this statement does:
1.  It confirms that there is at least one person with blue eyes on the island.
2.  Crucially, this fact becomes *common knowledge*. Every islander knows it, every islander knows that every other islander knows it, and so on, ad infinitum. This is because all islanders heard the Guru, know the Guru always tells the truth, and know that all other islanders are perfect logicians who also heard the Guru.

Let's analyze the situation for increasing numbers of blue-eyed people:

Case 1: Suppose there was only 1 blue-eyed person (and 199 brown-eyed).
*   This one blue-eyed person (B1) looks around and sees 199 brown-eyed people. Before the Guru spoke, B1 wouldn't know their own eye color. They might think, ""Perhaps everyone has brown eyes, including me.""
*   After the Guru's statement, B1 thinks: ""The Guru says there is at least one blue-eyed person. I see no one else with blue eyes. If my eyes were brown, then there would be no blue-eyed people for the Guru to see, which contradicts her statement. Therefore, I must be the blue-eyed person.""
*   B1 would be certain of their blue eyes and would leave on Night 1.
*   The brown-eyed people would each see B1 (blue) and 198 other brown-eyed people. When B1 leaves on Night 1, they would then deduce they must be brown-eyed (otherwise B1 wouldn't have been so certain) and could leave on Night 2.

Case 2: Suppose there were only 2 blue-eyed people (B1, B2) (and 198 brown-eyed).
*   B1 sees one other blue-eyed person (B2) and 198 brown-eyed people.
*   B2 sees one other blue-eyed person (B1) and 198 brown-eyed people.
*   B1 thinks: ""I see B2 has blue eyes. The Guru confirmed there's at least one blue-eyed person. What if my eyes are brown? If I am brown-eyed, then B2 is the *only* blue-eyed person on the island. In that scenario (Case 1), B2 would look around, see no other blue eyes, and deduce (because of the Guru's statement) that they must be blue-eyed. B2 would then leave on Night 1. So, I will wait to see if B2 leaves on Night 1.""
*   B2 reasons identically about B1.
*   Night 1 passes, and no one leaves. (B2 didn't leave because B2 saw B1 with blue eyes, so B2 wasn't in the 'Case 1' situation from their perspective. Similarly for B1.)
*   On the morning of Day 2, B1 thinks: ""B2 did not leave on Night 1. My hypothesis was: 'If I am brown-eyed, B2 would have left on Night 1.' Since B2 did not leave, my hypothesis must be false. The only way for it to be false is if my premise ('I am brown-eyed') is false. Therefore, I must be blue-eyed.""
*   B2 reasons identically.
*   Both B1 and B2 become certain they have blue eyes and will leave on Night 2.

Generalization (Inductive Step):
Assume that if there are `k` blue-eyed people, they all figure it out and leave on Night `k`.

Now, consider the situation if there are `k+1` blue-eyed people.
*   Each of these `k+1` blue-eyed people sees `k` other blue-eyed people.
*   Let's call one such blue-eyed person Alex. Alex sees `k` other blue-eyed people.
*   Alex thinks: ""I see `k` blue-eyed people. The Guru confirmed there's at least one. What if my eyes are brown? If I am brown-eyed, then there are exactly `k` blue-eyed people on the island (the ones I am looking at). Based on our established pattern (the inductive hypothesis), these `k` blue-eyed people would all deduce their eye color and leave on Night `k`. So, I will wait to see if they leave on Night `k`.""
*   Every one of the `k+1` blue-eyed people reasons this way.
*   Nights 1, 2, ..., `k` pass. No one leaves. (This is because for anyone to leave on Night `k`, they would have had to see `k-1` blue eyes, which didn't happen as everyone in this group sees `k` blue eyes).
*   On the morning of Day `k+1` (after Night `k` has passed), Alex thinks: ""Those `k` blue-eyed people I see did *not* leave on Night `k`. My hypothesis was: 'If I am brown-eyed, those `k` people would have left on Night `k`.' Since they did not leave, my hypothesis must be false. The only way for it to be false is if my premise ('I am brown-eyed') is false. Therefore, I must be blue-eyed.""
*   All `k+1` blue-eyed people simultaneously reach this conclusion. They will all leave on Night `k+1`.

Applying to the problem:
There are 100 blue-eyed people and 100 brown-eyed people.
*   Each of the 100 blue-eyed people sees 99 other blue-eyed people (and 100 brown-eyed people).
*   Let's follow the logic for one blue-eyed person, Alice:
    Alice thinks: ""I see 99 blue-eyed people.
    Hypothesis: My eyes are brown.
    If my eyes are brown, then there are exactly 99 blue-eyed people on the island. According to the pattern, these 99 people would all deduce they are blue-eyed and leave on Night 99.
    So, I will wait until after Night 99.""
*   All 100 blue-eyed people reason this way.
*   Nights 1 through 98 pass. No one leaves. This is expected by Alice, as if she were brown-eyed, people would only leave on night 99.
*   Night 99 passes. No one leaves.
    (Why? Because each of the 100 blue-eyed people sees 99 others. For someone to leave on Night 99, they would have had to see 98 blue-eyed people, then hypothesize they were brown, then expect those 98 to leave on Night 98. Since that didn't happen, they would deduce they are blue and leave on Night 99. But everyone actually sees 99 blue eyes).
*   On the morning of Day 100, Alice thinks: ""The 99 blue-eyed people I see did *not* leave on Night 99. My hypothesis ('If my eyes are brown, they would have left on Night 99') is false. Therefore, my premise ('My eyes are brown') must be false. So, my eyes must be blue.""
*   All 100 blue-eyed people simultaneously reach this conclusion. They will all approach the captain on Night 100, state they have blue eyes, and leave the island.

What about the brown-eyed people?
*   Each of the 100 brown-eyed people sees 100 blue-eyed people (and 99 other brown-eyed people).
*   Let's follow the logic for one brown-eyed person, Bob:
    Bob thinks: ""I see 100 blue-eyed people.
    Hypothesis 1: My eyes are brown. If so, there are exactly 100 blue-eyed people. They will all deduce this and leave on Night 100.
    Hypothesis 2: My eyes are blue. If so, there are 101 blue-eyed people (the 100 I see, plus me). We would all deduce this and leave on Night 101.""
*   Bob waits. Nights 1 through 99 pass, and no one leaves. This is consistent with both his hypotheses.
*   On Night 100, all 100 blue-eyed people (that Bob can see) announce they have blue eyes and leave the island.
*   On the morning of Day 101, Bob thinks: ""The 100 blue-eyed people I could see left on Night 100. This exactly matches my Hypothesis 1 (I am brown-eyed). It falsifies Hypothesis 2 (I am blue-eyed, which would have meant we all leave on Night 101). Therefore, I must be brown-eyed.""
*   All 100 brown-eyed people simultaneously reach this conclusion. They will all approach the captain on Night 101, state they have brown eyes, and leave the island.

The question asks ""Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?"" This typically refers to the first group whose departure is directly triggered by the chain of deduction from the Guru's statement.

The 100 blue-eyed islanders leave on the 100th night.
The 100 brown-eyed islanders leave on the 101st night.

Final answer: The 100 blue-eyed islanders will all leave on the 100th night after the guru's announcement. The 100 brown-eyed islanders will subsequently deduce their own eye color and leave on the 101st night.",True

Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point.

If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.
Thus ( geography-history );
David - Gail - Waters - 16 -8;
Edward - Anne - O'Connell - 11- 12;

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?","On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.

2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

The first and second horses in Race #7 are the second and third horses of the entire stable.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this down step-by-step.

**Step 1: Initial Races to Rank All Horses within Groups**

1.  We have 25 horses and can race 5 at a time.
2.  To get an initial assessment, we divide the horses into 5 groups (A, B, C, D, E) of 5 horses each.
    *   Race 1: Group A (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 - where A1 is fastest, A2 second, etc.)
    *   Race 2: Group B (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5)
    *   Race 3: Group C (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)
    *   Race 4: Group D (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5)
    *   Race 5: Group E (E1, E2, E3, E4, E5)
3.  After these 5 races, we know the ranking within each group. For example, A1 is faster than A2, A2 is faster than A3, and so on.

**Races run so far: 5**

**Step 2: Finding the Fastest Horse Overall**

1.  The fastest horse overall must be one of the winners from the initial 5 races (A1, B1, C1, D1, E1). If the fastest horse wasn't a group winner (e.g., it was A2), then A1 would be even faster, which is a contradiction.
2.  Race these 5 winners against each other:
    *   Race 6: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1
3.  Let's assume, without loss of generality, that the outcome of this race is:
    A1 > B1 > C1 > D1 > E1 (where "">"" means ""is faster than"").
4.  Therefore, A1 is the fastest horse overall.

**Races run so far: 5 + 1 = 6**

**Step 3: Identifying Candidates for 2nd and 3rd Fastest**

We know A1 is the fastest. Now we need to find the 2nd and 3rd fastest.
Let's analyze the information we have from the 6 races, assuming A1 > B1 > C1 > D1 > E1 in Race 6.

*   **Guaranteed Fastest:** A1

*   **Horses that cannot be in the top 3:**
    *   D1, E1: Since A1, B1, and C1 are all faster than D1 and E1, D1 and E1 cannot be in the top 3.
    *   Any horse from Group D or Group E (except D1 and E1, which are already eliminated): For example, D2 is slower than D1. Since D1 is not in the top 3, D2 cannot be either. Same logic applies to D3, D4, D5, E2, E3, E4, E5.
    *   C2, C3, C4, C5: C1 is faster than these. Since A1 and B1 are faster than C1, it means A1, B1, and C1 are all faster than C2, C3, C4, C5. So these cannot be in the top 3 (unless C1 itself is 2nd or 3rd, which makes C2 a possibility only if C1 is 2nd and C2 is faster than B1's next best). Let's refine this.
        *   If C1 is 3rd, then C2 cannot be 2nd or 3rd (as A1 and B1 are faster).
        *   We know A1 > B1 > C1.
    *   B3, B4, B5: B1 is faster than these. A1 is faster than B1. So A1 and B1 are faster than B3, B4, B5. If C1 is also faster than B3, B4, B5 (which it is if C1 is faster than B1, which isn't necessarily true *yet* for B2 vs C1), then these are out. We know A1, B1 are faster than B2. We know B2 is faster than B3. So A1, B1, B2 are faster than B3. So B3, B4, B5 are out.
    *   A4, A5: A1, A2, A3 are all faster than A4 and A5. So A4 and A5 cannot be in the top 3.

*   **Potential Candidates for 2nd and 3rd place:**
    1.  **B1**: Came 2nd in the race of winners (Race 6). It's slower than A1.
    2.  **C1**: Came 3rd in the race of winners (Race 6). It's slower than A1 and B1.
    3.  **A2**: Came 2nd in its heat to A1. We know A1 > A2. We don't know how A2 compares to B1 or C1. A2 *could* be faster than B1.
    4.  **A3**: Came 3rd in its heat to A1 (and A2). We know A1 > A2 > A3. A3 *could* be faster than C1, or even B1 if A2 is faster than B1.
    5.  **B2**: Came 2nd in its heat to B1. We know A1 > B1 > B2. We don't know how B2 compares to C1 or A2/A3. B2 *could* be faster than C1.

    So the candidates for the 2nd and 3rd spots are: A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.
    These are 5 horses.

    Let's verify this list:
    *   A1 is 1st.
    *   Who could be 2nd? Either B1 (who lost to A1 in race 6) or A2 (who lost to A1 in heat A).
    *   Who could be 3rd?
        *   If B1 is 2nd: then C1 (lost to A1,B1 in race 6), A2 (lost to A1 in heat A), or B2 (lost to B1 in heat B) could be 3rd.
        *   If A2 is 2nd: then B1 (lost to A1 in race 6), A3 (lost to A1,A2 in heat A), or C1 (lost to A1,B1 in race 6) could be 3rd.

    The set of horses that could possibly be 2nd or 3rd overall are:
    *   The horse that came 2nd to A1 in Race 6 (this is B1).
    *   The horse that came 3rd to A1 in Race 6 (this is C1).
    *   The horse that came 2nd to A1 in A1's initial heat (this is A2).
    *   The horse that came 3rd to A1 in A1's initial heat (this is A3) - A3 could be 3rd if, for example, A1 > A2 > A3 and A3 is faster than B1, C1, B2.
    *   The horse that came 2nd to B1 in B1's initial heat (this is B2) - B2 could be 3rd if, for example, A1 > B1 > B2 and B2 is faster than C1 and A2,A3.

    These are 5 distinct horses: A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.

**Step 4: The Final Race to Determine 2nd and 3rd**

1.  We have 5 candidates for the 2nd and 3rd positions: A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.
2.  Race these 5 horses against each other:
    *   Race 7: A2, A3, B1, B2, C1
3.  The horse that finishes 1st in this race is the 2nd fastest horse overall.
4.  The horse that finishes 2nd in this race is the 3rd fastest horse overall.

**Races run so far: 6 + 1 = 7**

**Summary of Races:**
1.  5 initial races to rank horses within 5 groups.
2.  1 race of the 5 winners to find the fastest horse (A1).
3.  1 race of the 5 potential candidates for 2nd and 3rd (A2, A3, B1, B2, C1) to find the actual 2nd and 3rd fastest horses.

Total races = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Let's confirm this is the minimum.
We needed 5 races to see every horse.
We needed a 6th race to compare winners. This identified the fastest.
To find the 2nd and 3rd, consider the identified set: {A2, A3, B1, B2, C1}.
- A1 > B1 > C1
- A1 > A2 > A3
- B1 > B2
We have no direct comparison between (A2, A3) and (B1, C1, B2). For instance, we don't know if A2 > B1 or B1 > A2. We also don't know if B2 > C1 or C1 > B2. To resolve these unknowns among these 5 candidates to find the top two from this specific group (who will be 2nd and 3rd overall), one more race is indeed necessary.

Therefore, the minimum number of races is 7.

Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches.

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1.  **Calculate the total water needed for one boat to pass through all locks.**
    *   There are 13 locks.
    *   Each lock use loses 7000 L of water.
    *   For a boat to pass through all 13 locks (assuming it goes from bottom to top, or top to bottom, it will ""use"" each lock once, causing that lock to lose water that needs to be replenished at the top), the total water lost from the summit pound (the top level) that needs replenishing is:
        13 locks * 7000 L/lock = 91000 L

2.  **Calculate the water carrying capacity of the truck in Liters.**
    *   The truck can carry 22 tons of water.
    *   1 metric ton = 1000 kg.
    *   So, the truck can carry 22 tons * 1000 kg/ton = 22000 kg of water.
    *   The density of fresh water is approximately 1 kg/L.
    *   Therefore, the truck can carry 22000 kg / (1 kg/L) = 22000 L of water per trip.

3.  **Calculate the number of truck trips needed to replenish the water for one boat passage.**
    *   Total water needed: 91000 L
    *   Water per truck trip: 22000 L
    *   Number of trips = Total water needed / Water per trip
        Number of trips = 91000 L / 22000 L/trip ≈ 4.136 trips.

    *   Since the truck cannot make a partial trip to deliver a precise amount (it either delivers its full load or nothing, or we assume it can deliver partial loads but it's simpler to assume full loads are more efficient), it would need to make 5 full trips to ensure enough water is supplied.
        4 trips * 22000 L/trip = 88000 L (This is not enough)
        5 trips * 22000 L/trip = 110000 L (This is enough, with a surplus)

4.  **Assess the reasonableness of the contract.**
    *   To allow just *one* boat to pass through the canal system, 5 round trips with a 22-ton water truck are required.
    *   Consider the implications:
        *   **Time:** Loading the truck, driving from the bottom to the top (which could be a significant distance by road, even if the canal is shorter), unloading the water, and returning to the bottom for a refill would take a substantial amount of time for each trip. Multiplying this by 5 makes the process very slow for a single boat passage.
        *   **Cost:** Renting a 22-ton truck, fuel costs for 5 round trips, and driver wages would be considerable for each boat.
        *   **Efficiency:** Canals are designed to move boats with relative efficiency using water flow and lock mechanics. Relying on trucks to supply the primary water source is highly inefficient.
        *   **Scalability:** If more than one boat wishes to use the canal in a day, or even a week, the number of truck trips would multiply, making the operation extremely cumbersome and expensive.
        *   **The core problem:** A canal without a water supply at the top is fundamentally flawed. Historically, canals were fed by rivers, streams, reservoirs, or pumping stations at their summit level. Using trucks is a temporary, emergency measure, not a sustainable operational model.

    *   **Conclusion on reasonableness:**
        *   As a one-off emergency measure to move a single, very important boat, it *might* be considered if no other option exists and the urgency is extreme.
        *   As a regular operational contract for the canal, it is highly unreasonable. The cost, time, and logistical effort involved per boat passage are prohibitive for any normal canal operation. The canal is essentially non-functional for regular traffic without a proper water feed.

The question ""Is the contract reasonable?"" implies a general operational context unless specified as an emergency.

Therefore, for regular or even semi-regular use of the canal, this contract is not reasonable. It highlights a fundamental issue with the canal's water supply that trucking cannot sustainably solve.

Final answer: The contract is not reasonable.
Why:
1.  Total water needed for one boat passage: 13 locks * 7000 L/lock = 91000 L.
2.  Truck capacity: 22 tons = 22000 kg = 22000 L of water.
3.  Number of trips needed per boat passage: 91000 L / 22000 L/trip ≈ 4.136 trips. This means 5 full truck trips are required.
Requiring 5 round trips with a 22-ton truck to move water from the bottom to the top for a single boat passage is extremely inefficient, costly in terms of truck rental, fuel, and driver time, and very slow. This indicates a fundamental problem with the canal's water supply system, as canals are not designed to be replenished in this manner for regular operation. Such a contract would only make sense in a dire emergency for a single, crucial transit, but not for any form of sustained canal operation.",True

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"This is a classic scenario about risk and reward, and performance-based incentives.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **The Nature of the Job:** The job was ""difficult and dangerous."" This means there's a significant risk of failure, delays, or a subpar outcome.

2.  **Company A's Offer:** $800,000. This is a fixed price. If Company A takes the job and fails, or does a poor job, the Emperor might still be out a significant amount of money (depending on contract terms like progress payments), or at least face a difficult contractual dispute. The risk is largely on the Emperor if Company A isn't competent or lucky.

3.  **Company B's Initial Stance:** ""Not less than $1,000,000."" This suggests they believe the true cost and risk warrant a higher price.

4.  **Company B's ""Offer You Cannot Refuse"":** The key is that the payment amounts ($200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000) were likely tied to different levels of success or outcomes for the bridge project. The ""details"" Contractor B provided would have spelled this out.

    *   **$200,000:** This could be the payment if Company B attempts the bridge but fails to complete it or if the completed bridge is unusable or structurally unsound. This sum would likely cover some of B's initial outlay and effort, minimizing their total loss, while also being a relatively small loss for the Emperor in a failure scenario. It's much better for the Emperor to pay $200,000 for a failed project than potentially $800,000 (or a large portion of it) to Company A for a similar failure.
    *   **$750,000:** This could be the payment if Company B successfully completes the bridge to a satisfactory, agreed-upon standard. This is *less* than Company A's bid of $800,000. So, if Company B delivers a standard, good bridge, the Emperor saves money compared to Company A.
    *   **$1,000,000:** This would be the payment if Company B successfully completes the bridge and it exceeds expectations – perhaps it's completed ahead of schedule, with exceptional quality, innovative design, or under particularly challenging circumstances that were overcome. The Emperor *chooses* this payment level because he is thoroughly impressed and satisfied.

5.  **Why the Offer Sounded Good to the Emperor:**
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** The Emperor's biggest risk (a failed bridge and large financial loss) is significantly reduced. If the bridge isn't built properly, he only pays $200,000.
    *   **Potential Savings:** If the bridge is built to a good, standard quality, he pays $750,000, which is $50,000 less than Company A's offer.
    *   **Value for Money:** He only pays the highest amount ($1,000,000) if he receives an exceptional outcome that he deems worthy of that price. He is in control of this final assessment (""The decision is completely up to you in the end"").
    *   **Confidence:** Company B's willingness to structure their payment this way showed immense confidence in their ability to deliver a high-quality result. They were essentially betting on their own success.

6.  **How Company B Ended Up with $1,000,000:**
    Company B successfully completed the bridge project to an exceptionally high standard. The Emperor was so pleased with the outcome (perhaps the quality, the speed of completion, the aesthetics, or how well they handled unforeseen challenges) that he willingly chose to pay the highest agreed-upon amount of $1,000,000, as per the terms of their agreement. He felt he received excellent value for that price. Company B delivered on the promise of an outcome worthy of the top tier payment.

In essence, Company B proposed a performance-based contract where their earnings were directly tied to the quality and success of the project, with the Emperor having the final say on the assessment of that success.

Final answer: Company B's offer sounded good because it shifted a significant portion of the project risk from the Emperor to themselves. The payment structure was likely tiered: a low payment ($200,000) for failure or a very poor outcome, a moderate payment ($750,000, which was less than Company A's bid) for a satisfactory completion, and a high payment ($1,000,000) for an exceptional completion. This gave the Emperor a ""no-lose"" or ""less-lose"" scenario compared to a fixed-price contract with Company A, where failure could still be very costly. Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 because they successfully built the bridge to such an outstanding standard that the Emperor, as per their agreement, willingly chose to pay the highest amount, deeming the exceptional result well worth the cost.",True
58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field
-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.
The shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True
61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Here's what happened:

**Understanding the Rules and Baseline Expectations:**
1.  **The Rule:** If you drink poison A, you die unless you then drink poison B, where poison B is stronger than A. Poison B neutralizes A, but you are now under the effect of B.
2.  **The Contest:**
    *   Pharmacist (P) drinks Treasurer's (T) concoction.
    *   Treasurer (T) drinks Pharmacist's (P) concoction.
    *   Pharmacist (P) drinks his own concoction.
    *   Treasurer (T) drinks his own concoction.
3.  **Expected Outcome (No Tricks):** The Pharmacist is an expert and will make a poison (P_strong) much stronger than anything the Treasurer can make (T_weak).
    *   P drinks T_weak. (P has T_weak in system)
    *   T drinks P_strong. (T has P_strong in system)
    *   P drinks P_strong. P_strong neutralizes T_weak. P survives (affected by P_strong).
    *   T drinks T_weak. T_weak cannot neutralize P_strong. T dies from P_strong.
    *   Pharmacist wins, King gets P_strong.

**The Treasurer's Plan (as deduced by the Pharmacist):**
The Treasurer knew he couldn't win a direct contest of poison strength. His plan was based on outthinking the Pharmacist:
1.  **Treasurer's Assumption about the Pharmacist:** The Treasurer guessed that the Pharmacist might think: ""The Treasurer knows he can't win. He'll probably try to trick me. Maybe he'll give me water (or a very weak, harmless substance) in his first cup. If he gives me water, I don't want to drink my own super-strong poison afterwards unnecessarily. So, for my *own* second drink, I'll prepare water. But to fulfill the King's wish and prove my skill, I'll still give the Treasurer my strongest poison in *his* first cup.""
2.  **Treasurer's Deception:** Based on this, the Treasurer planned to do the *opposite* of what he hoped the Pharmacist would expect.
    *   **Cup T1 (for Pharmacist):** The Treasurer would prepare a genuine, moderately strong poison (T_poison).
    *   **Cup T2 (for Treasurer himself):** The Treasurer would prepare the same genuine poison (T_poison).
3.  **Treasurer's Intended Outcome:**
    *   P is expected by T to prepare: Cup P1 (for T) = P_strongest_poison; Cup P2 (for P himself) = Water.
    *   T prepares: Cup T1 (for P) = T_poison; Cup T2 (for T himself) = T_poison.
    *   **Execution if Pharmacist fell for it:**
        1.  P drinks T1 (T_poison). (P is now poisoned with T_poison).
        2.  T drinks P1 (P_strongest_poison). (T is now poisoned with P_strongest_poison).
        3.  P drinks P2 (Water). Water is weaker than T_poison, so it cannot neutralize it. **Pharmacist dies.**
        4.  T drinks T2 (T_poison). T_poison is weaker than P_strongest_poison. It cannot neutralize P_strongest_poison. **Treasurer dies.**

This was likely Treasurer's *initial* desperate plan to at least take the Pharmacist down with him. However, the riddle states ""survive and make sure the pharmacist dies"". So the Treasurer's more refined plan must have been:

**Treasurer's Refined Plan (to survive and make P die, as deduced by P):**
1.  The Treasurer will bring a genuine poison (T_P) in *both* his cups (the one he gives P, and the one he drinks himself).
2.  The Treasurer hopes the Pharmacist will overthink things and assume the Treasurer, knowing he can't win fairly, will bring *water* for the Pharmacist (T1=Water).
3.  If the Pharmacist believes T1 will be water, the Pharmacist might reason:
    *   ""To avoid drinking my own strong poison after just water, my second cup (P2) should be water.""
    *   ""And to expose the Treasurer's 'water trick' or to be 'magnanimous' since the Treasurer isn't playing seriously, my first cup (P1, for the Treasurer) should *also* be water.""
4.  So, the Treasurer's plan (T1=T_P, T2=T_P) relies on the Pharmacist preparing P1=Water, P2=Water.
    *   **Execution if Pharmacist fell for this refined plan:**
        1.  P drinks T1 (T_P). P is poisoned by T_P.
        2.  T drinks P1 (Water). T is fine.
        3.  P drinks P2 (Water). Water is weaker than T_P. P DIES from T_P.
        4.  T drinks T2 (T_P). T_P is stronger than Water. T_P ""neutralizes"" the water. T is affected by T_P but SURVIVES.

**The Pharmacist's Realization and Counter-Plan (What Actually Happened):**
The Pharmacist, after some thought, realized the Treasurer's likely multi-layered deceptive plan.
1.  **Pharmacist's Deduction:** ""The Treasurer thinks I'll try to outsmart him by expecting him to bring water, leading me to bring water for myself (and possibly for him). He will therefore bring actual poison.""
2.  **Pharmacist's Counter:** The Pharmacist decided to ignore any potential tricks and play it straight, but with full awareness. He would prepare his genuinely strongest poison (P_S) for both cups.
    *   Cup P1 (for Treasurer): P_S (Pharmacist's strongest poison).
    *   Cup P2 (for Pharmacist himself): P_S (Pharmacist's strongest poison).
3.  The Treasurer proceeds with his plan:
    *   Cup T1 (for Pharmacist): T_P (Treasurer's poison).
    *   Cup T2 (for Treasurer himself): T_P (Treasurer's poison).

**The Actual Events:**
1.  **Pharmacist drinks Treasurer's poison:** P drinks T1 (T_P). Pharmacist now has T_P in his system.
2.  **Treasurer drinks Pharmacist's poison:** T drinks P1 (P_S). Treasurer now has P_S in his system. (Note: P_S is much stronger than T_P).
3.  **Pharmacist drinks his own poison:** P drinks P2 (P_S). Since P_S is stronger than T_P, it neutralizes the T_P in his system. The Pharmacist is now under the effect of P_S, but he SURVIVES the contest.
4.  **Treasurer drinks his own poison:** T drinks T2 (T_P). Since T_P is weaker than P_S (which is already in his system), it cannot neutralize P_S. The Treasurer DIES from the Pharmacist's stronger poison.

**Outcome:**
*   The Treasurer died.
*   The Pharmacist survived.
*   The King didn't get what he wanted because the strongest poison (P_S), which the Pharmacist had prepared, was consumed during the contest. One dose was used by the Pharmacist to save himself, and the other dose was consumed by (and killed) the Treasurer. There was no sample of the ""strongest poison"" left for the King to possess. He only witnessed its effects and knew the Pharmacist could make it.

Final answer: The Treasurer planned to give the Pharmacist a real poison (T_P) and drink T_P himself, hoping the Pharmacist would, in an attempt to outsmart the Treasurer (by anticipating the Treasurer would bring water), fill both his own cups with water. This would lead to the Pharmacist drinking T_P then water (dying), and the Treasurer drinking water then T_P (surviving). The Pharmacist realized this plan. So, the Pharmacist prepared his actual strongest poison (P_S) for both his cups.
The sequence of events was:
1. Pharmacist drank the Treasurer's poison (T_P).
2. Treasurer drank the Pharmacist's strongest poison (P_S).
3. Pharmacist drank his own strongest poison (P_S), which neutralized T_P, so he survived.
4. Treasurer drank his own poison (T_P), which was weaker than P_S already in his system, so he died from P_S.
The King didn't get what he wanted (to possess the strongest poison) because both samples of the Pharmacist's strongest poison were consumed in the contest.",True

For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.

C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.

2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.

Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.

From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.

From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.

76,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

SQ Root of 25 = 5",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Okay, let's explore how ""3 + 4 = 5"" could be considered true, by stepping outside the bounds of standard arithmetic.

In standard, everyday arithmetic, using base 10 integers, 3 + 4 unequivocally equals 7. So, for 3 + 4 = 5 to be true, we must be operating under a different set of rules or interpretations.

Here are a few scenarios:

**1. Geometric Interpretation (Right-Angled Triangles - Pythagorean Theorem):**
This is the most common ""trick"" or non-standard interpretation for these specific numbers.
*   If '3' and '4' represent the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) of a right-angled triangle, and '5' represents the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse), then they are related by the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c².
*   In this case: 3² + 4² = 5²
    *   9 + 16 = 25
    *   25 = 25
*   So, if the ""+"" symbol isn't representing simple addition but rather the ""combination"" of two perpendicular lengths to find the resulting hypotenuse of the triangle they form, then one could *metaphorically* say that combining a length of 3 and a length of 4 (at a right angle) ""results in"" a hypotenuse of length 5.
*   This isn't 3 + 4 = 5 in an arithmetic sense, but rather (side 3) and (side 4) ""form a right triangle with"" (hypotenuse 5).

**2. Modular Arithmetic:**
We can consider arithmetic ""modulo n"". The expression a ≡ b (mod n) means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n, or equivalently, (a - b) is an integer multiple of n.
Let's see if there's an 'n' for which 3 + 4 ≡ 5 (mod n).
*   3 + 4 = 7.
*   So we are looking for an 'n' such that 7 ≡ 5 (mod n).
*   This means that (7 - 5) must be a multiple of n.
*   2 must be a multiple of n.
*   The positive integers 'n' for which 2 is a multiple are n = 1 and n = 2.
    *   Modulo 1: All integers are congruent modulo 1. So 7 ≡ 5 (mod 1) is true. This is a trivial case.
    *   Modulo 2:
        *   7 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1. So, 7 ≡ 1 (mod 2).
        *   5 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1. So, 5 ≡ 1 (mod 2).
        *   Since both 7 and 5 are congruent to 1 (mod 2), it is true that 7 ≡ 5 (mod 2).
        *   Therefore, 3 + 4 ≡ 5 (mod 2).

**3. Redefinition of Symbols:**
*   If the symbol ""+"" does not mean standard addition, or if the symbols ""3"", ""4"", or ""5"" do not represent their standard numerical values, then the equation could be made true by definition within a specific, newly defined system. For example:
    *   Let ""3"" represent the value 1.
    *   Let ""4"" represent the value 4.
    *   Let ""+"" represent standard addition.
    *   Let ""5"" represent the value 5.
    *   Then 1 + 4 = 5, which means ""3"" + ""4"" = ""5"" in this contrived system.
    *   Or, more abstractly, if we are working with elements of a set where operations are defined differently. For instance, if we are counting segments. If you have a line segment of 3 units and you add a segment of 4 units to it, but then 2 units of it ""disappear"" or are ""cancelled out"" by some rule, you might be left with 5 units. This is highly contrived.

**4. A Mistake or a Different Base (Less Likely for this Specific Result):**
*   It could simply be a statement of an error.
*   Could it be a different number base? If 3 + 4 = 5 in base 'b'. Since 3, 4, and 5 are all single digits, the base 'b' must be greater than 5 (i.e., b ≥ 6). In any such base, 3_b + 4_b = 7_10. For 7_10 to be represented as 5_b, this would mean 7 = 5, which is false. So, a simple change of base for the numbers themselves doesn't make 3+4 result in the digit 5, unless the sum 7 was represented as something like 12_b (which would mean b=5, but then '5' isn't a digit) or other multi-digit number that *looks* like '5' if there's a typo. This path doesn't lead to a clean ""5"".

**Conclusion:**

The most common and elegant ""solutions"" to how 3 + 4 = 5 can be possible are:
1.  **Geometric Interpretation (Pythagorean Triple):** If 3 and 4 are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 5. The ""+"" is a conceptual ""combining"" of sides.
2.  **Modular Arithmetic (Modulo 2):** 3 + 4 = 7, and 7 ≡ 5 (mod 2) because both 7 and 5 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

Without further context, the Pythagorean interpretation is often what is implied by this specific riddle.

Final answer: In standard arithmetic, 3 + 4 = 7, not 5. However, 3 + 4 = 5 can be considered true in specific contexts:
1.  **Geometric Context (Pythagorean Theorem):** If 3 and 4 are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) of a right-angled triangle, then the length of the longest side (hypotenuse) is 5. This is because 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, and 5² = 25. Here, the ""+"" isn't standard addition but rather a conceptual combination of sides to form the triangle.
2.  **Modular Arithmetic:** Specifically, in modulo 2 arithmetic.
    3 + 4 = 7.
    We want to check if 7 ≡ 5 (mod 2).
    7 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1. (7 = 3*2 + 1)
    5 divided by 2 gives a remainder of 1. (5 = 2*2 + 1)
    Since their remainders are the same when divided by 2, 7 ≡ 5 (mod 2). Thus, 3 + 4 ≡ 5 (mod 2).
3.  **Redefinition of Symbols:** If the symbols ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", or ""+"" are defined differently from their standard mathematical meanings, then any equation can be made true. For example, if ""+"" means ""take the first number, add 1, and then add the second number divided by 2"", then 3 + 1 + (4/2) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. This is just an example of how symbols can be redefined, though it doesn't lead to 5 in this specific instance without a very specific redefinition.",True

She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)

**1. Mary Beem's Immediate Family:**
*   Mary Beem: Victim, wife, mother of four, grandmother of nine.
*   Attendees at funeral: Direct descendants and their spouses.
*   Grandchildren: Not married, no kids.
*   No two people have the same first name.
*   The NOTE: ""Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids."" This refers to the couples formed by Mary's children and their spouses.

**2. Identifying Mary's Husband and some Children/Grandchildren:**
*   From ""The killer's sister ... her grandfather Bob"": Bob is a grandfather.
*   Clue 7: ""Bob was with his daughter Maria.""
    *   If Bob is Mary's husband, then Maria is one of Mary's 4 children.
*   Clue 4: ""Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.""
    *   Robin is Bob's daughter. Mo is her husband. They have at least two sons (grandchildren of Mary & Bob).
    *   This makes Robin another of Mary's children.
*   Clue 6: ""Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.""
    *   Myra is Mary's daughter (since Brad is Mary's grandchild). Myra has two children, one of whom is Brad.
    *   If Bob is Mary's husband, then his daughters are Maria and Robin. If Myra is also Bob's daughter (and thus Mary's daughter), and considering ""no two people have the same first name,"" it's highly likely that Maria and Myra are the same person. Let's assume **Maria = Myra**.
    *   So, Maria/Myra is Mary's daughter and has two children, one named Brad.

**So far, Mary and Bob's children:**
1.  Maria/Myra (daughter, has 2 children, one is Brad)
2.  Robin (daughter, married to Mo, has at least 2 sons)

**3. More of Mary's Children and Grandchildren:**
*   Clue 3: ""Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.""
    *   May is Mary's daughter. Ben is her husband. Missy and Bernie are Mary's grandchildren.
    *   This is the third child of Mary.
*   Clue 2: ""Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.""
    *   Bart, Buck, and Bruce are brothers and Mary's grandsons. They are children of Mary's fourth child.

**Mary and Bob's 4 Children:**
1.  Maria/Myra (daughter)
2.  Robin (daughter, married to Mo)
3.  May (daughter, married to Ben)
4.  A son or daughter (parent of Bart, Buck, and Bruce)

**4. Identifying the Fourth Child (Parent of Bart, Buck, Bruce):**
*   From ""The killer's sister ... her uncle (blood relative) Bill.""
    *   Bill is a blood uncle to the killer's sister. This means Bill is a brother to the killer's sister's parent.
    *   Therefore, Bill must be one of Mary and Bob's children (a son).
    *   Since Maria/Myra, Robin, and May are daughters, Bill must be the fourth child, and thus the father of Bart, Buck, and Bruce.

**Mary and Bob's 4 Children (Finalized):**
1.  Maria/Myra (daughter)
2.  Robin (daughter, married to Mo)
3.  May (daughter, married to Ben)
4.  Bill (son, father of Bart, Buck, Bruce)

**5. Grandchildren Count and Details:**
*   Total grandchildren = 9.
*   Maria/Myra's children: Clue 6 says she has two children, one is Brad. Clue 5: ""Bo was by himself... while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan."" If Bo and Molly are siblings, they could be Maria/Myra's two children. If Bo is Brad (Clue 6 mentions Myra consoling Brad, Clue 5 says Bo was grieving by himself - consistent for someone close to grandmother), then Maria/Myra's children are **Bo (Brad)** and **Molly**. (2 grandchildren)
*   Robin and Mo's children: ""their sons"" (plural, so at least 2). Given the ""4 couples each have at least 2 kids"" rule and we need to reach 9 grandchildren, let's assume they have exactly **2 sons** for now. (2 grandchildren)
*   May and Ben's children: **Missy** and **Bernie**. (2 grandchildren)
*   Bill's children: **Bart, Buck, Bruce**. (3 grandchildren)

Total grandchildren: 2 (from Maria/Myra) + 2 (from Robin) + 2 (from May) + 3 (from Bill) = 9. This matches.

**6. Spouses for Mary's Children (The 4 Couples):**
*   Robin is married to Mo. (Couple 1: Robin & Mo, 2 sons)
*   May is married to Ben. (Couple 2: May & Ben, Missy & Bernie)
*   Bill is the father of Bart, Buck, Bruce. He needs a wife (Mrs. Bill) to form the couple. (Couple 3: Bill & Mrs. Bill, Bart, Buck, Bruce)
*   Maria/Myra has children Bo (Brad) and Molly. She needs a husband.
    *   Clue 1: ""Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.""
        *   This means either Barry is married to Bill's sister, or Bill is married to Barry's sister.
        *   Bill's sisters are Maria/Myra, Robin (married to Mo), May (married to Ben).
        *   The only available sister for Barry to be married to is Maria/Myra. So, **Barry is Maria/Myra's husband**. (Couple 4: Maria/Myra & Barry, Bo/Brad & Molly)

**7. Verifying Cousin Megan:**
*   Clue 5: ""Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.""
    *   Molly's parents are Maria/Myra and Barry.
    *   Molly's aunts/uncles (parents of her cousins) are Robin, May, Bill.
    *   Robin's children: 2 sons. So Megan is not Robin's child.
    *   Bill's children: Bart, Buck, Bruce (all male). So Megan is not Bill's child.
    *   May's children: Missy (female), Bernie (male). So, **Megan must be Missy**. This works as Molly and Missy are daughters of sisters (Maria/Myra and May), making them cousins.

**8. Identifying the Killer's Sister:**
The killer's sister confirmed her distrust by talking to:
*   Her grandfather Bob. (All 9 grandchildren share Bob as a grandfather).
*   Her cousin Bo. (Bo is the son of Maria/Myra and Barry).
*   Her uncle (blood relative) Bill. (Bill is the son of Mary and Bob).

Let's call the killer's sister ""KS"".
*   KS's uncle is Bill. This means KS's parent must be a sibling of Bill. Bill's siblings are Maria/Myra, Robin, and May. So KS is a daughter of one of these three.
    *   Daughters of Maria/Myra: Molly.
    *   Daughters of Robin: None (only sons).
    *   Daughters of May: Missy (also known as Megan).
*   So, KS is either Molly or Missy.
*   KS's cousin is Bo.
    *   If KS is Molly: Bo is Molly's brother, not her cousin. So Molly is NOT the killer's sister.
    *   If KS is Missy: Missy's mother is May. Bo's mother is Maria/Myra. May and Maria/Myra are sisters. Therefore, Missy and Bo are cousins. This FITS.

So, the killer's sister is **Missy**.

**9. Identifying the Killer:**
*   The killer is the sibling of the killer's sister (Missy).
*   Missy's parents are May and Ben.
*   Missy's sibling (from Clue 3) is **Bernie**.

Therefore, Bernie is the killer.

**Family Tree Summary:**

1. The first three guests were, in some order: the person surnamed Ivens, the person from Berkeley and the antique car collector.
2. Damien's segment was sometime before Lautremont's segment.
3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.
10. The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15.","Females are Alice, Cathy and Francine; males are Brandon, Damien and Evan.","6:45, Damien Ivens, Oakland, Beekeeper
7:00, Alice Lautremont, Palo Alto, Antique car collector

7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.
Since Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto. Likewise, Kreiger, who must be from Daly City, cannot be Francine, and must be named Evan. This leaves Francine at 8:00.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point

2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).","Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

104,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)

(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

Each vote is either aye (Y) or nay (N). We can represent Y as 1 and N as 0 for counting purposes.
Let A_j be the number of aye votes for proposal j, and N_j be the number of nay votes for proposal j.
There are 5 council members, so A_j + N_j = 5 for each proposal j.

1.  **Clue 2: Total Aye and Nay Votes**
    There are 5 members and 5 proposals, so 5 * 5 = 25 total votes cast.
    Let Total_A be the total number of aye votes and Total_N be the total number of nay votes.
    We are given Total_A = Total_N + 1.
    Since Total_A + Total_N = 25, we can substitute: (Total_N + 1) + Total_N = 25 => 2 * Total_N = 24 => Total_N = 12.
    So, Total_A = 13.
    The sum of aye votes across all proposals is A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + A_5 = 13.

2.  **Clue 1: Distinct Number of Aye Votes per Proposal**
    Each proposal received a different number of aye votes. The number of aye votes A_j can range from 0 to 5.
    So, {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5} is a set of 5 distinct numbers from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
    The sum of all possible aye counts is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
    Since the sum of the A_j for the five proposals is 13 (from Clue 2), the number from {0,1,2,3,4,5} that is *not* in {A_1, ..., A_5} must be 15 - 13 = 2.
    So, the number of aye votes for the proposals are a permutation of {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}.

3.  **Clue 7: Relation between A_2 and A_3**
    A_3 = A_2 + 1.

    - If A_2 = 0, A_3 = 1. This pair (0,1) is valid.
    - If A_2 = 1, A_3 = 2. This is invalid, as 2 is not in the set {0,1,3,4,5}.
    - If A_2 = 3, A_3 = 4. This pair (3,4) is valid.
    - If A_2 = 4, A_3 = 5. This pair (4,5) is valid.
    - If A_2 = 5, A_3 = 6. This is invalid, as A_3 cannot exceed 5.

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"This is a problem that can be solved using game theory and logical deduction, by considering the rationality of both the dog and the flower.

Let's define the preferences and outcomes for both the dog and the flower.

**Dog's Preferences (from best to worst):**
1.  Eat flower, flower is not poisonous (Dog survives 100%).
2.  Don't eat flower (Dog survives 50% from virus, dies 50% from virus). This is the baseline.
3.  Eat flower, flower is poisonous (Dog dies 100%).

Let's assign utility values for the dog:
*   Eat non-poisonous flower: +10 (certain survival)
*   Don't eat flower: 0 (50% chance of survival, 0.5 * (+10 for survive) + 0.5 * (-10 for die from virus) = 0, or simply the baseline)
*   Eat poisonous flower: -10 (certain death)

**Flower's Preferences (from best to worst):**
1.  Flower survives, no poison made (lives without effort).
2.  Flower survives, poison made (lives, but with effort).
3.  Flower is eaten (dies). The effort of making poison is wasted if eaten anyway.

Let's assign utility values for the flower:
*   Survives, no poison: +10
*   Survives, poison made: +5 (still good to survive, but poison is costly)
*   Eaten (dies): -10 (whether it made poison or not, being eaten is the worst outcome for its survival; if eaten, making poison was also wasted effort, so it might even be -11, but -10 is sufficient to mark it as worst).

Both the dog and the flower know each other's rationality and preferences. We need to determine their actions. This is a sequential decision-making process, even though the actions might seem simultaneous, the reasoning is based on anticipating the other's rational response.

**Step 1: Flower's Analysis (anticipating the dog's actions)**

The flower needs to decide whether to make poison or not. It will do so by considering what the rational dog would do in response to each choice.

*   **Scenario A: Flower does NOT make poison (NP).**
    *   The flower knows the dog is rational.
    *   If the dog eats the non-poisonous flower, the dog gets 100% survival (utility +10).
    *   If the dog does not eat, the dog has a 50% chance of survival (utility 0).
    *   A rational dog will choose the action that maximizes its utility. Comparing +10 and 0, the dog will choose to **eat the flower**.
    *   Flower's outcome in Scenario A: Eaten (utility -10 for the flower).

*   **Scenario B: Flower DOES make poison (P).**
    *   The flower knows the dog is rational.
    *   If the dog eats the poisonous flower, the dog dies (utility -10).
    *   If the dog does not eat, the dog has a 50% chance of survival (utility 0).
    *   A rational dog will choose the action that maximizes its utility. Comparing -10 and 0, the dog will choose **not to eat the flower**.
    *   Flower's outcome in Scenario B: Survives, but made poison (utility +5 for the flower).

**Step 2: Flower's Decision**

The flower compares its own outcomes from Scenario A and Scenario B:
*   Outcome if it doesn't make poison (NP): Flower is eaten (utility -10).
*   Outcome if it makes poison (P): Flower survives with effort (utility +5).

A rational flower will choose the action that maximizes its utility. Comparing -10 and +5, the flower will choose to **make poison**. This is consistent with assumption 6: ""the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it."" In this case, making poison does prevent the dog from eating it.

**Step 3: Dog's Analysis (knowing the flower's rational decision)**

The dog is rational and knows the flower is rational. The dog can perform the same analysis (Steps 1 and 2) that the flower did.
*   The dog deduces that the flower, being rational, will have analyzed the situation as above and will have concluded that making poison is its best strategy.
*   Therefore, the dog knows (through",True

115,"One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?",Think about the letters in each name. ,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, list all the people and their groups, and then determine the number of vowels in their first names (A, E, I, O, U, treating Y as a consonant unless explicitly stated otherwise, which seems to be the case here based on Larry/Curly).

**Groups and Individuals (Vowel Count in First Name):**

1.  **KINGS:**
    *   James (J**a**m**e**s): 2 vowels
    *   Saul (S**au**l): 2 vowels
    *   Henry (H**e**nry): 1 vowel (Y is not a vowel here, otherwise Henry's actions wouldn't match Larry/Curly's)

2.  **QUEENS:**
    *   Victoria (V**i**ct**o**r**ia**): 4 vowels
    *   Elizabeth (**E**l**i**z**a**b**e**th): 4 vowels
    *   Candace (C**a**nd**a**c**e**): 3 vowels

3.  **RELIGIOUS FIGURES:**
    *   Pope (P**o**p**e**): 2 vowels
    *   Mother Teresa (M**o**th**e**r T**e**r**e**s**a**): 5 vowels (treating ""Mother Teresa"" as her identifying name unit as presented)
    *   Gandhi (G**a**ndh**i**): 2 vowels

4.  **STOOGES:**
    *   Moe (M**oe**): 2 vowels
    *   Larry (L**a**rry): 1 vowel (Y is not a vowel here)
    *   Curly (C**u**rly): 1 vowel (Y is not a vowel here)

**The Pattern Set by the Stooges:**

1.  **Moe (2 vowels) taps:**
    *   James (2 vowels) twice
    *   Gandhi (2 vowels) twice
    *   Pope (2 vowels) twice
    *   Saul (2 vowels) twice
    *   *Observation:* Moe has 2 vowels. He taps people with 2 vowels, twice.

2.  **Larry (1 vowel) taps:**
    *   Henry (1 vowel) once
    *   Curly (1 vowel) once
    *   *Observation:* Larry has 1 vowel. He taps people with 1 vowel, once.

3.  **Curly (1 vowel) taps:**
    *   Henry (1 vowel) once
    *   Larry (1 vowel) once
    *   *Observation:* Curly has 1 vowel. He taps people with 1 vowel, once.

**The Pattern seems to be:** A person with 'N' vowels in their first name taps other individuals who also have 'N' vowels in their first name, 'N' times.

**Let's verify this pattern with the KINGS:**

1.  **James (2 vowels) taps:**
    *   Pope (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   Saul (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   Gandhi (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   Moe (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   *Confirmation:* James follows the pattern.

2.  **Saul (2 vowels) taps:**
    *   Gandhi (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   Moe (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   James (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   Pope (2 vowels) twice (Matches)
    *   *Confirmation:* Saul follows the pattern.

3.  **Henry (1 vowel) taps:**
    *   Larry (1 vowel) once (Matches)
    *   Curly (1 vowel) once (Matches)
    *   *Confirmation:* Henry follows the pattern.

**Let's verify this pattern with the QUEENS:**

1.  **Elizabeth (4 vowels) and Victoria (4 vowels) tap each other four times each.**
    *   Elizabeth (4 vowels) taps Victoria (4 vowels) four times. (Matches)
    *   Victoria (4 vowels) taps Elizabeth (4 vowels) four times. (Matches)
    *   *Confirmation:* Elizabeth and Victoria follow the pattern.

**The Pattern is Confirmed:** People with N vowels in their name tap other people with N vowels in their name, N times.
**Stipulation:** Religious Figures do not tap anyone, but they can be tapped.

**Now let's determine who taps whom, and therefore, who gets tapped:**

*   **People with 1 vowel:** Henry (1), Larry (1), Curly (1).
    *   Henry taps Larry and Curly.
    *   Larry taps Henry and Curly.
    *   Curly taps Henry and Larry.
    *   *Tapped:* Henry, Larry, Curly.

*   **People with 2 vowels:** James (2), Saul (2), Pope (2), Gandhi (2), Moe (2).
    *   James taps Saul, Pope, Gandhi, Moe.
    *   Saul taps James, Pope, Gandhi, Moe.
    *   Moe taps James, Saul, Pope, Gandhi.
    *   Pope (RF) does not tap.
    *   Gandhi (RF) does not tap.
    *   *Tapped:* James, Saul, Pope, Gandhi, Moe.

*   **People with 3 vowels:** Candace (3).
    *   Are there any other people with 3 vowels? No.
    *   Therefore, Candace has no one to tap according to the pattern.
    *   And, more importantly for this question, no one has 3 vowels to tap Candace.
    *   *Tapped:* Candace is NOT tapped.

*   **People with 4 vowels:** Victoria (4), Elizabeth (4).
    *   Victoria taps Elizabeth.
    *   Elizabeth taps Victoria.
    *   *Tapped:* Victoria, Elizabeth.

*   **People with 5 vowels:** Mother Teresa (5).
    *   Are there any other people with 5 vowels? No.
    *   Therefore, Mother Teresa (even if she weren't an RF) would have no one to tap.
    *   And, no one has 5 vowels to tap Mother Teresa.
    *   *Tapped:* Mother Teresa is NOT tapped.

**Summary of who gets tapped:**
*   James: Yes (by Moe, Saul)
*   Saul: Yes (by Moe, James)
*   Henry: Yes (by Larry, Curly)
*   Victoria: Yes (by Elizabeth)
*   Elizabeth: Yes (by Victoria)
*   Candace: No (no one else has 3 vowels to tap her)
*   Pope: Yes (by Moe, James, Saul)
*   Mother Teresa: No (no one else has 5 vowels to tap her)
*   Gandhi: Yes (by Moe, James, Saul)
*   Moe: Yes (by James, Saul)
*   Larry: Yes (by Henry, Curly)
*   Curly: Yes (by Henry, Larry)

The ""Untouchables"" are those who are not tapped.
Based on our analysis, the individuals who are not tapped are Candace and Mother Teresa.

Final check:
Candace has 3 vowels. No other person has 3 vowels. So no one can tap Candace according to the pattern ""person with N vowels taps another person with N vowels"".
Mother Teresa has 5 vowels. No other person has 5 vowels. So no one can tap Mother Teresa according to the pattern.

The stipulation about Religious Figures not tapping anyone is relevant for who *performs* taps (Pope and Gandhi don't tap despite having 2 vowels), but it doesn't prevent them from *being tapped* if the pattern dictates it (which it does for Pope and Gandhi).

The untouchables are Candace and Mother Teresa.

116,"Four members of the Madadian pro-celebrity Kebab wrestling team took part in a charity pool match to raise money for new spandex sequined grease proof leotards
Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff and Hayden Seek participated in the POOL competition.
FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"To determine who won the competition and the total points scored by each player, we need to find the scores of each player in every game they played. Let the players be Al Gore-Rhythm (AG), Annie Buddyhome (AB), Dan Druff (DD), and Hayden Seek (HS). There are 15 points (balls) in each game, so if player X scores Px points against player Y, player Y scores 15 - Px points. Each player plays against every other player once, so there are C(4,2) = 6 games in total.

Let's use the given outcomes to find the scores in each game:

1.  **Outcome 3: Dan Druff (DD) beat Hayden Seek (HS) by 5 points in the match between them.**
    Let DD_vs_HS be DD's score against HS, and HS_vs_DD be HS's score against DD.
    DD_vs_HS + HS_vs_DD = 15
    DD_vs_HS - HS_vs_DD = 5
    Adding these two equations: 2 * DD_vs_HS = 20 => DD_vs_HS = 10.
    So, HS_vs_DD = 15 - 10 = 5.
    *   In the game DD vs HS: DD scored 10 points, HS scored 5 points.

2.  **Outcome 5: Al Gore-Rhythm (AG) scored twice as many points as Dan Druff (DD) in their game.**
    Let AG_vs_DD be AG's score against DD, and DD_vs_AG be DD's score against AG.
    AG_vs_DD + DD_vs_AG = 15
    AG_vs_DD = 2 * DD_vs_AG
    Substituting the second into the first: 2 * DD_vs_AG + DD_vs_AG = 15 => 3 * DD_vs_AG = 15 => DD_vs_AG = 5.
    So, AG_vs_DD = 2 * 5 = 10.
    *   In the game AG vs DD: AG scored 10 points, DD scored 5 points.

3.  **Outcome 6: Hayden Seek (HS) scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm (AG) than he did against Dan Druff (DD).**
    We know from step 1 that HS_vs_DD = 5 points.
    So, HS_vs_AG = HS_vs_DD - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 points.
    In the game AG vs HS, HS scored 4 points. Therefore, AG scored AG_vs_HS = 15 - HS_vs_AG = 15 - 4 = 11 points.
    *   In the game AG vs HS: AG scored 11 points, HS scored 4 points.

4.  **Outcome 7: Dan Druff (DD) scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome (AB).**
    So, DD_vs_AB = 7 points.
    In the game AB vs DD, DD scored 7 points. Therefore, AB scored AB_vs_DD = 15 - DD_vs_AB = 15 - 7 = 8 points.
    *   In the game AB vs DD: AB scored 8 points, DD scored 7 points.

5.  **Outcome 1: Hayden Seek (HS) finished with 18 points.**
    HS plays three games: against AG, DD, and AB.
    HS_total = HS_vs_AG + HS_vs_DD + HS_vs_AB.
    From step 3, HS_vs_AG = 4 points.
    From step 1, HS_vs_DD = 5 points.
    So, 18 = 4 + 5 + HS_vs_AB => 18 = 9 + HS_vs_AB => HS_vs_AB = 9 points.
    In the game AB vs HS, HS scored 9 points. Therefore, AB scored AB_vs_HS = 15 - HS_vs_AB = 15 - 9 = 6 points.
    *   In the game AB vs HS: AB scored 6 points, HS scored 9 points.

6.  **Outcome 4 and 2: Determine scores for AG vs AB and AG's total points.**
    Outcome 4: There was one point difference in the match between Annie Buddyhome (AB) and Al Gore-Rhythm (AG).
    Let AG_vs_AB be AG's score against AB, and AB_vs_AG be AB's score against AG.
    AG_vs_AB + AB_vs_AG = 15.
    |AG_vs_AB - AB_vs_AG| = 1.
    This means the scores are 8 and 7. So, either (AG:8, AB:7) or (AG:7, AB:8).
    Now, let's calculate AG's total points. AG plays against AB, DD, and HS.
    AG_total = AG_vs_AB + AG_vs_DD + AG_vs_HS.
    From step 2, AG_vs_DD = 10 points.
    From step 3, AG_vs_HS = 11 points.
    So, AG_total = AG_vs_AB + 10 + 11 = AG_vs_AB + 21.
    Outcome 2: Al Gore-Rhythm (AG) finished with an odd number of total points.
    If AG_vs_AB = 7 (so AB scored 8), then AG_total = 7 + 21 = 28 points (even). This contradicts Outcome 2.
    If AG_vs_AB = 8 (so AB scored 7), then AG_total = 8 + 21 = 29 points (odd). This is consistent with Outcome 2.
    Therefore, AG_vs_AB = 8 and AB_vs_AG = 7.
    *   In the game AG vs AB: AG scored 8 points, AB scored 7 points.
    AG's total score is 29 points.

Now we have the scores for all games:
*   AG vs AB: AG 8, AB 7
*   AG vs DD: AG 10, DD 5
*   AG vs HS: AG 11, HS 4
*   AB vs DD: AB 8, DD 7
*   AB vs HS: AB 6, HS 9
*   DD vs HS: DD 10, HS 5

Now, we calculate the total points for each player:

*   **Al Gore-Rhythm (AG):**
    AG_total = AG_vs_AB + AG_vs_DD + AG_vs_HS = 8 + 10 + 11 = 29 points.

*   **Annie Buddyhome (AB):**
    AB_total = AB_vs_AG + AB_vs_DD + AB_vs_HS = 7 (vs AG) + 8 (vs DD) + 6 (vs HS) = 21 points.

*   **Dan Druff (DD):**
    DD_total = DD_vs_AG + DD_vs_AB + DD_vs_HS = 5 (vs AG) + 7 (vs AB) + 10 (vs HS) = 22 points.

*   **Hayden Seek (HS):**
    HS_total = HS_vs_AG + HS_vs_AB + HS_vs_DD = 4 (vs AG) + 9 (vs AB) + 5 (vs DD) = 18 points.
    (This matches Outcome 1, HS finished with 18 points).

The total points for each player are:
*   Al Gore-Rhythm: 29 points
*   Annie Buddyhome: 21 points
*   Dan Druff: 22 points
*   Hayden Seek: 18 points

To find the winner of the competition, we compare their total points:
Al Gore-Rhythm: 29 points
Dan Druff: 22 points

Hayden Seek: 18 points

Al Gore-Rhythm has the highest score (29 points).

1.  **I am always excited:** This strongly suggests the **exclamation mark (!)**.

2.  **I tell people where things are at:** This points to the **""at"" symbol (@)**.

3.  **You can play a game on me:** This refers to a **keyboard** itself, as many games are played using one. The ""We"" are likely characters *on* the keyboard.

4.  **I'm very rich:** This suggests the **dollar sign ($)**.

5.  **I give percentages:** This points to the **percent sign (%)**.

6.  **I am always looking up:** This describes the **caret symbol (^)**, which points upwards.

7.  **And.........:** This clearly indicates the **ampersand (&)**, which means ""and"".

8.  **I look like a light in the sky:** This refers to the **asterisk (*)**, which means ""little star"".

9.  **I keep things arranged that are to my right:** This describes an **opening parenthesis ( ( )**, which groups or arranges the content that follows it (to its right).

10. **I keep things arranged that are to my left:** This describes a **closing parenthesis ( ) )**, which completes the grouping or arrangement of the content that preceded it (to its left).

All these symbols (!, @, $, %, ^, &, *, (, )) are found on the number row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, typically accessed by holding down the Shift key and pressing a number key (Shift+1 for !, Shift+2 for @, Shift+4 for $, Shift+5 for %, Shift+6 for ^, Shift+7 for &, Shift+8 for *, Shift+9 for (, Shift+0 for ) ). Clue 3 refers to the keyboard itself as the platform for these symbols.

Therefore, ""We"" are these symbols.

Use your keyboard like a grid. Tab, caps lock and shift are the vertical side of the grid and one  through nine are the horizontal side of the grid. For example shift five would be B.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Okay, let's break this code step by step, assuming a standard QWERTY keyboard layout and interpreting the instructions as follows:

*   **Shift <number>**: Refers to pressing the Shift key and the number key on the top row of the keyboard to get the symbol.
*   **Caps lock <number>**: Refers to the Nth letter of the alphabet, typed in uppercase.
*   **Tab <number>**: Refers to the Nth letter of the alphabet, typed in lowercase (unless a ""Caps Lock"" state is implied to be persistent, but usually these codes are character by character). We'll assume it means the Nth letter, and ""Caps lock"" specifically makes *that* letter uppercase.

Let's decode each instruction:

**Line 1:**
1.  **Shift three**: On a standard QWERTY keyboard, Shift + 3 = **#**
2.  **Caps lock one**: The 1st letter of the alphabet is A. Caps lock implies uppercase. So, **A**.
3.  **Shift six**: On a standard QWERTY keyboard, Shift + 6 = **^**

So, Line 1 gives: **#A^**

**Line 2:**
4.  **Tab six**: The 6th letter of the alphabet is F. Tab implies lowercase. So, **f**.
5.  **Tab nine**: The 9th letter of the alphabet is I. Tab implies lowercase. So, **i**.
6.  **Tab seven**: The 7th letter of the alphabet is G. Tab implies lowercase. So, **g**.

So, Line 2 gives: **fig**

**Line 3:**
7.  **Tab four**: The 4th letter of the alphabet is D. Tab implies lowercase. So, **d**.
8.  **Tab three**: The 3rd letter of the alphabet is C. Tab implies lowercase. So, **c**.
9.  **Caps lock one**: The 1st letter of the alphabet is A. Caps lock implies uppercase. So, **A**.
10. **Caps lock three**: The 3rd letter of the alphabet is C. Caps lock implies uppercase. So, **C**.

So, Line 3 gives: **dcAC**

**Line 4:**
11. **Tab five**: The 5th letter of the alphabet is E. Tab implies lowercase. So, **e**.
12. **Caps lock six**: The 6th letter of the alphabet is F. Caps lock implies uppercase. So, **F**.
13. **Tab eight**: The 8th letter of the alphabet is H. Tab implies lowercase. So, **h**.
14. **Caps lock two**: The 2nd letter of the alphabet is B. Caps lock implies uppercase. So, **B**.
15. **Shift 10**: This refers to the ""0"" key on the number row (as it's the 10th digit if you count 1-9 then 0). Shift + 0 = **)**

So, Line 4 gives: **eFhB)**

124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

125,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z

Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:

126,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,True

129,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.

131,"In the following code, each symbol stands for one of five letters.
@ stands for E, C, O, N, or A
6 stands for L, E, P, W, or T
& stands for E, S, B, R, or G
^ stands for N, H, A, T, or K
The four letter code word, 6@&^, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?",Directionality,East and West.,GeminiPro,basicprompt,"The problem asks us to find two four-letter English words that are opposites. These words must be formed from the code `6@&^`, where each symbol represents a letter from a specific set. The key is that the code `6@&^` can be translated into these two different words, meaning the letter chosen for each symbol can change between the two words, as long as the chosen letter comes from the allowed set for that symbol.

Let's list the possible letters for each symbol:
1.  `6`: {L, E, P, W, T}
2.  `@`: {E, C, O, N, A}
3.  `&`: {E, S, B, R, G}
4.  `^`: {N, H, A, T, K}

We need to find Word1 (L1 L2 L3 L4) and Word2 (M1 M2 M3 M4) such that:
*   L1 and M1 are from `6`'s set.
*   L2 and M2 are from `@`'s set.
*   L3 and M3 are from `&`'s set.
*   L4 and M4 are from `^`'s set.
*   Word1 and Word2 are opposites.

Let's try some common four-letter opposite pairs and see if they fit the letter constraints for each position.

Consider the pair **EAST** and **WEST**. These are four-letter words and are opposites (directions).

Let's check if **EAST** can be formed:
*   1st letter (from `6`): E. Is E in {L, E, P, W, T}? Yes.
*   2nd letter (from `@`): A. Is A in {E, C, O, N, A}? Yes.
*   3rd letter (from `&`): S. Is S in {E, S, B, R, G}? Yes.
*   4th letter (from `^`): T. Is T in {N, H, A, T, K}? Yes.
So, EAST can be formed by choosing `6`=E, `@`=A, `&`=S, `^`=T.

Now let's check if **WEST** can be formed using the same symbol constraints:
*   1st letter (from `6`): W. Is W in {L, E, P, W, T}? Yes.
*   2nd letter (from `@`): E. Is E in {E, C, O, N, A}? Yes.
*   3rd letter (from `&`): S. Is S in {E, S, B, R, G}? Yes.
*   4th letter (from `^`): T. Is T in {N, H, A, T, K}? Yes.
So, WEST can be formed by choosing `6`=W, `@`=E, `&`=S, `^`=T.

Both words can be formed according to the rules, and they are opposites.
For EAST:
`6` represents E
`@` represents A
`&` represents S
`^` represents T

For WEST:
`6` represents W
`@` represents E
`&` represents S (same as for EAST)
`^` represents T (same as for EAST)

This fits all the conditions of the problem.

Let's briefly consider another pair like LOST / FOUND.
LOST:
L (from `6` - yes)
O (from `@` - yes)
S (from `&` - yes)
T (from `^` - yes) -> LOST is possible.
FOUND:
F (from `6` - no, F is not in {L,E,P,W,T}) -> FOUND is not possible as the first word.
(FOUND is also 5 letters, so it wouldn't qualify anyway).

What about LOST / KEPT?
LOST (as above) is possible.
KEPT:
K (from `6` - no, K is not in {L,E,P,W,T}) -> KEPT is not possible.

The pair EAST / WEST works perfectly.

Final answer: EAST and WEST",True
132,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.

Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8
5+7
Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.

The words for the numbers end in vowels.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Let's analyze the sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12.
We want to find the next number in this sequence.

First, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:
Term 2 - Term 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
Term 3 - Term 2 = 3 - 2 = 1
Term 4 - Term 3 = 5 - 3 = 2
Term 5 - Term 4 = 9 - 5 = 4
Term 6 - Term 5 = 12 - 9 = 3

So, the sequence of differences is: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3.
Let this sequence of differences be D1 = [1, 1, 2, 4, 3]. We need to find the next term in this sequence of differences, let's call it 'y'. Once we find 'y', the number on the last stone will be 12 + y.

Let's examine the sequence D1 = [1, 1, 2, 4, 3] for a pattern.
We can look at two interleaved sequences within D1:
1.  The terms at odd positions in D1: D1[1], D1[3], D1[5], ...
    These are: 1 (the first term), 2 (the third term), 3 (the fifth term).
    This sequence is 1, 2, 3. It appears to be an arithmetic progression, increasing by 1 each time. The next term in this odd-position sequence would be 3 + 1 = 4 (this would be the 7th term of D1).

2.  The terms at even positions in D1: D1[2], D1[4], D1[6], ...
    These are: 1 (the second term), 4 (the fourth term). We are looking for the next term in this sequence, which will be the 6th term of D1 (our 'y').
    This sequence is 1, 4.
    If this is an arithmetic progression, the common difference is 4 - 1 = 3.
    So, the next term would be 4 + 3 = 7.
    Thus, y = 7.

According to this pattern:
The sequence of differences D1 is formed by:
-   Odd positions: 1, 2, 3, (4, ...)
-   Even positions: 1, 4, 7, (10, ...)
So, D1 = [1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 4, 10, ...].

The next difference we need is the 6th term of D1, which we found to be 7.

Now, we add this difference to the last known term of the original sequence (12):
Number on the last stone = 12 + 7 = 19.

Let's verify this overall pattern:
Original sequence:
1
1 + 1 (1st diff, odd group) = 2
2 + 1 (2nd diff, even group) = 3
3 + 2 (3rd diff, odd group) = 5
5 + 4 (4th diff, even group) = 9
9 + 3 (5th diff, odd group) = 12
12 + 7 (6th diff, even group) = 19

This pattern seems consistent and is based on simple arithmetic progressions for the interleaved difference sequences.

Alternative for the even positions in D1:
If the sequence 1, 4, ... was based on squares (1^2, 2^2, ...), then the next term would be 3^2 = 9.
In this case, y = 9.
The number on the last stone would be 12 + 9 = 21.
The sequence of differences D1 would be [1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 9].
Odd positions: 1, 2, 3 (arithmetic, add 1)
Even positions: 1, 4, 9 (squares)
This is also a plausible pattern. However, patterns that use the same type of progression (e.g., both arithmetic) for interleaved sequences are often considered simpler or more standard in such puzzles than mixing",True

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

    But Clue #4 states Kitchen was cleaned on Wednesday. Since Den and Kitchen are different rooms, this is a contradiction. So, Day X cannot be Monday.
*   If Day X is Tuesday:
    *   Tuesday: 1 message.
    *   Wednesday: Cleaned Bathroom.
    *   Thursday: Cleaned Den.
    But Clue #4 states Kitchen was cleaned on Wednesday. Since Bathroom and Kitchen are different rooms, this is a contradiction. So, Day X cannot be Tuesday.
*   If Day X is Wednesday:
    *   Wednesday: 1 message.
    *   Thursday: Cleaned Bathroom.
    *   Friday: Cleaned Den.
    Clue #4 states Kitchen was cleaned on Wednesday. This means on Wednesday, Emily cleaned the Kitchen AND received 1 message. This is consistent.

So, we can update the table based on this deduction:
| Day       | Room Cleaned | Number of Messages |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| Monday    |              |                    |
| Tuesday   |              |                    |
| Wednesday | Kitchen      | 1                  |
| Thursday  | Bathroom     |                    |
| Friday    | Den          |                    |

The remaining rooms to be assigned are Bedroom and Living Room. These must be cleaned on Monday and Tuesday.
The remaining message counts to be assigned are 2, 3, 4, 5 for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

Let M_Day represent the number of messages received on that day.
Let M_RoomCleaned represent the number of messages received on the day that specific room was cleaned.

**Clue #1: Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.**
This translates to: M_DayBedroomCleaned < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday.

**Clue #3: She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.**
This translates to: M_DayDenCleaned < M_DayBedroomCleaned.

Combining these two inequalities:
M_DayDenCleaned < M_DayBedroomCleaned < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday.

We know:
*   Den was cleaned on Friday, so M_DayDenCleaned = M_Friday.
*   The Bedroom was cleaned on either Monday or Tuesday.
    *   If Bedroom was cleaned on Monday, then M_DayBedroomCleaned = M_Monday.
    *   If Bedroom was cleaned on Tuesday, then M_DayBedroomCleaned = M_Tuesday.

Let's test the case where Bedroom was cleaned on Tuesday:
If M_DayBedroomCleaned = M_Tuesday, the inequality becomes: M_Friday < M_Tuesday < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday.
The part M_Tuesday < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday implies M_Tuesday < M_Tuesday, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, the Bedroom was not cleaned on Tuesday.

So, the Bedroom must have been cleaned on Monday. This means M_DayBedroomCleaned = M_Monday.
The inequality becomes: M_Friday < M_Monday < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday.

The messages for Friday, Monday, Thursday, and Tuesday must be 2, 3, 4, and 5 in some order (since 1 message was on Wednesday).
Given the strict inequality M_Friday < M_Monday < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday, we can assign the message counts:
*   M_Friday = 2
*   M_Monday = 3
*   M_Thursday = 4
*   M_Tuesday = 5

Now we can update the messages in our table:
| Day       | Room Cleaned | Number of Messages |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| Monday    |              | 3                  |
| Tuesday   |              | 5                  |
| Wednesday | Kitchen      | 1                  |
| Thursday  | Bathroom     | 4                  |
| Friday    | Den          | 2                  |

We deduced that the Bedroom was cleaned on Monday.
The only remaining room is the Living Room, and the only day left to assign a room is Tuesday. So, the Living Room was cleaned on Tuesday.

Let's complete the table:
| Day       | Room Cleaned | Number of Messages |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| Monday    | Bedroom      | 3                  |
| Tuesday   | Living Room  | 5                  |
| Wednesday | Kitchen      | 1                  |
| Thursday  | Bathroom     | 4                  |
| Friday    | Den          | 2                  |

Let's verify this solution against all clues:
1.  **Clue #1:** Emily received more messages on Thursday (4) than on the day she cleaned her bedroom (Monday, 3 messages), but fewer than on Tuesday (5 messages).
    Is 3 < 4 < 5? Yes, this is true. (M_Monday < M_Thursday < M_Tuesday)
2.  **Clue #2:** Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message (Wednesday, 1 message) and one day before she cleaned the den (Friday).
    Bathroom was cleaned on Thursday. Thursday is the day after Wednesday. Den was cleaned on Friday. Thursday is one day before Friday. Yes, this is true.
3.  **Clue #3:** She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday, 3 messages) than when she cleaned the den (Friday, 2 messages).
    Is 3 > 2? Yes, this is true. (M_Monday > M_Friday)
4.  **Clue #4:** Emily cleaned the kitchen on Wednesday.
    Yes, Kitchen is on Wednesday.

All clues are satisfied.

Final schedule:
*   **Monday:** Cleaned Bedroom, received 3 messages.
*   **Tuesday:** Cleaned Living Room, received 5 messages.
*   **Wednesday:** Cleaned Kitchen, received 1 message.
*   **Thursday:** Cleaned Bathroom, received 4 messages.
*   **Friday:** Cleaned Den, received 2 messages.

Final answer:
Monday: Emily cleaned the Bedroom and received 3 messages.
Tuesday: Emily cleaned the Living Room and received 5 messages.
Wednesday: Emily cleaned the Kitchen and received 1 message.
Thursday: Emily cleaned the Bathroom and received 4 messages.
Friday: Emily cleaned the Den and received 2 messages.",True
139,"In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?
Given:
Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""

Cross off what you know is NOT the correct answer from the clues, and when you find a chapter number that fits a title, circle it, or write the information on the piece of paper in a different section to keep track.  Do the same with the other correlations that can be surmised by looking at the clues:
(Chapter Names) -- (Students Names)

Keep in mind that for example, if you find a chapter number for a title, the other chapter numbers can NOT have that title, so that gives you another answer to mark off to narrow the correct answer down.","Answers:
Chapter 1 -- ""Jung At Heart"" -- Caleb
Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""

From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Let H be Mad Ade's house number.
We are given three statements:
(1) If H is a multiple of 3, then H is a number from 50 through 59 (inclusive).
(Let P1 be ""H is a multiple of 3"" and Q1 be ""H is in [50, 59]"".) So, P1 => Q1.
(2) If H is not a multiple of 4, then H is a number from 60 through 69 (inclusive).
(Let P2 be ""H is not a multiple of 4"" and Q2 be ""H is in [60, 69]"".) So, P2 => Q2.
(3) If H is not a multiple of 6, then H is a number from 70 through 79 (inclusive).
(Let P3 be ""H is not a multiple of 6"" and Q3 be ""H is in [70, 79]"".) So, P3 => Q3.

A conditional statement ""P => Q"" is logically equivalent to ""not P OR Q"".
It is also equivalent to its contrapositive ""not Q => not P"".

Let R1 = [50, 59], R2 = [60, 69], R3 = [70, 79]. These three ranges are disjoint.
We can analyze the problem by considering four cases for H:
Case A: H is in R1.
Case B: H is in R2.
Case C: H is in R3.
Case D: H is not in R1, not in R2, and not in R3.

Case A: H is in R1 (i.e., 50 <= H <= 59).
Statement (1): P1 => Q1. Since H is in R1, Q1 (""H is in [50, 59]"") is True. So, P1 => True, which is always True, regardless of P1. This means statement (1) holds for any H in R1, whether H is a multiple of 3 or not.
Statement (2): P2 => Q2. Since H is in R1, H is not in R2. So Q2 (""H is in [60, 69]"") is False. For P2 => False to be True, P2 must be False. P2 is ""H is not a multiple of 4"". So, ""H is not a multiple of 4"" must be False, which means H must be a multiple of 4.
Statement (3): P3 => Q3. Since H is in R1, H is not in R3. So Q3 (""H is in [70, 79]"") is False. For P3 => False to be True, P3 must be False. P3 is ""H is not a multiple of 6"". So, ""H is not a multiple of 6"" must be False, which means H must be a multiple of 6.
So, if H is in R1, it must be a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6. Therefore, H must be a multiple of the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is lcm(4,6) = 12.
We need to find multiples of 12 in the range [50, 59].
Multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ...
None of these fall in the range [50, 59]. (48 is too small, 60 is too large).
Thus, there is no possible house number in Case A.

Case B: H is in R2 (i.e., 60 <= H <= 69).
Statement (1): P1 => Q1. Since H is in R2, H is not in R1. So Q1 (""H is in [50, 59]"") is False. For P1 => False to be True, P1 must be False. P1 is ""H is a multiple of 3"". So, H must not be a multiple of 3.
Statement (2): P2 => Q2. Since H is in R2, Q2 (""H is in [60, 69]"") is True. So, P2 => True, which is always True, regardless of P2. This means statement (2) holds for any H in R2.

147,"The following group of numbers represents an 11-letter word.  Can you figure out the word?
46244628466
31113211332",Try a phone.,Imagination!  Look on a telephone; the first row is what number to look on.  The second row is which letter to look at!,GeminiPro,basicprompt,"To figure out the 11-letter word represented by the given group of numbers, we first need to understand how the numbers encode the letters.
The numbers are given in two strings:
String 1: 46244628466
String 2: 31113211332

Both strings have a length of 11. This suggests that each letter in the 11-letter word is encoded by a pair of digits, one from each string at the corresponding position. Let the 11-letter word be L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 L8 L9 L10 L11. The i-th letter, L_i, is encoded by the pair (S1_i, S2_i), where S1_i is the i-th digit of String 1 and S2_i is the i-th digit of String 2.

Let's list these pairs:
For L1: (S1_1, S2_1) = (4, 3)
For L2: (S1_2, S2_2) = (6, 1)
For L3: (S1_3, S2_3) = (2, 1)
For L4: (S1_4, S2_4) = (4, 1)
For L5: (S1_5, S2_5) = (4, 3)
For L6: (S1_6, S2_6) = (6, 2)
For L7: (S1_7, S2_7) = (2, 1)
For L8: (S1_8, S2_8) = (8, 1)
For L9: (S1_9, S2_9) = (4, 3)
For L10: (S1_10, S2_10) = (6, 3)
For L11: (S1_11, S2_11) = (6, 2)

Now we need to determine the encoding scheme. Let's examine the range of values for the digits in each string:
Digits in String 1 (S1_i): {2, 4, 6, 8}
Digits in String 2 (S2_i): {1, 2, 3}

A common system for encoding letters using numbers is the telephone keypad. On a standard phone keypad:
-   Key 2 corresponds to A, B, C
-   Key 3 corresponds to D, E, F
-   Key 4 corresponds to G, H, I
-   Key 5 corresponds to J, K, L
-   Key 6 corresponds to M, N, O
-   Key 7 corresponds to P, Q, R, S
-   Key 8 corresponds to T, U, V
-   Key 9 corresponds to W, X, Y, Z

Let's hypothesize that the first digit (from String 1) indicates the key on the phone keypad, and the second digit (from String 2) indicates the position of the letter on that key (1 for the first letter, 2 for the second, 3 for the third).

Let's test this hypothesis with the observed digits:
The digits in String 1 are 2, 4, 6, 8.
-   Key 2 (ABC) has 3 letters.
-   Key 4 (GHI) has 3 letters.
-   Key 6 (MNO) has 3 letters.
-   Key 8 (TUV) has 3 letters.
All these keys indeed have 3 letters. The digits in String 2 are 1, 2, 3, which perfectly correspond to selecting one of these three letters. This strongly supports the hypothesis.

Let's decode each letter based on this scheme:
1.  L1: (4, 3) -> Key 4 (GHI). The 3rd letter is I.
2.  L2: (6, 1) -> Key 6 (MNO). The 1st letter is M.
3.  L3: (2, 1) -> Key 2 (ABC). The 1st letter is A.
4.  L4: (4, 1) -> Key 4 (GHI). The 1st letter is G.
5.  L5: (4, 3) -> Key 4 (GHI). The 3rd letter is I.
6.  L6: (6, 2) -> Key 6 (MNO). The 2nd letter is N.
7.  L7: (2, 1) -> Key 2 (ABC). The 1st letter is A.
8.  L8: (8, 1) -> Key 8 (TUV). The 1st letter is T.
9.  L9: (4, 3) -> Key 4 (GHI). The 3rd letter is I.
10. L10: (6, 3) -> Key 6 (MNO). The 3rd letter is O.
11. L11: (6, 2) -> Key 6 (MNO). The 2nd letter is N.

Now, let's assemble the letters to form the word:
I M A G I N A T I O N

The word is ""IMAGINATION"". This is a common English word with 11 letters. The phone keypad encoding (also known as multi-tap encoding) fits the given numbers perfectly.

Other encoding schemes, such as mapping numbers to letters based on their alphabetical position or positions on a QWERTY keyboard, are less likely given the specific combination of numbers. For instance, a grid-based system (e.g., S1 as row, S2 as column) using standard letter ordering did not yield a recognizable English word when tested. The consistency of S1 key choices (all having 3 letters) and S2 position choices (1, 2, or 3) makes the phone keypad hypothesis the most plausible.

Final check of the decoding process:
S1: 46244628466
S2: 31113211332
Letters:
(4,3) = I (GHI, 3rd)
(6,1) = M (MNO, 1st)
(2,1) = A (ABC, 1st)
(4,1) = G (GHI, 1st)
(4,3) = I (GHI, 3rd)
(6,2) = N (MNO, 2nd)
(2,1) = A (ABC, 1st)
(8,1) = T (TUV, 1st)
(4,3) = I (GHI, 3rd)
(6,3) = O (MNO, 3rd)
(6,2) = N (MNO, 2nd)
Word: IMAGINATION

The reasoning is sound and the resulting word is valid.

If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.
And that's that. We have covered all possibilities.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False
149,"Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:
Room A: small, borders rooms B and E
Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter

150,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.

You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.

The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False
166,"Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".","Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.  Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday.

What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?",You can cut pills in half,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile.

This means that each statement has either a false hypothesis or a true conclusion.","Carl is the landlord.
Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false.

So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.

You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;

They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.

But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

199,"I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.","First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.
Round      Me    Tweeto

Round 1    7           3
Round 2    6           4
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.
Round     Me    Tweeto

Round 2    5           5
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is false here because I lost the first round.
Hence it is clear from both the results that statements A and C must be true for me to end up with 4 cards at the end of three rounds.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.

If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card.

The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:

When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.
Morris the Daft:
A) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.
B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.
Robby O'Mental:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.
Considering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?","For each person, assume they did it. Count how many truthful statements there are?","Robby left the door open.
The one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.
There are only 3 truthful statements.
If Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.
If Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.
If Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.

Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!","Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?","In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False
242,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",Set up an equation.,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False

247,"You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,,False
248,"In a mathematics contest, A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H got the top eight places. The teacher asked them to guess who got first.

Since A and H agree with each other while E and F are against them, exactly two of these four must be true.
Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.",GeminiPro,basicprompt,"Let's denote the person who got first place as X.
The statements made by the eight people are:
S_A: ""F is first or H is first."" (This means X=F or X=H)
S_B: ""B is first."" (X=B)
S_C: ""G is first."" (X=G)
S_D: ""B is not first."" (X!=B)
S_E: ""A is wrong."" (This means S_A is false, so X!=F and X!=H)
S_F: ""Neither I nor H is the first."" (X!=F and X!=H)
S_G: ""C is not first."" (X!=C)
S_H: ""I agree with A."" (This means S_H makes the same statement as S_A: X=F or X=H)

The problem states that exactly three of these eight statements are true.

Let's analyze the relationships between the statements:
1.  S_A and S_H: S_A states ""X=F or X=H"". S_H states ""I agree with A"", which means S_H is true if S_A is true, and false if S_A is false. So, S_A and S_H are logically equivalent. This means either both are true or both are false.

2.  S_E and S_F: S_E states ""A is wrong"". This means S_A is false. If S_A is ""X=F or X=H"", then S_E means ""not (X=F or X=H)"", which is ""X!=F and X!=H"". S_F states ""Neither I nor H is the first"", which means ""X!=F and X!=H"". So, S_E and S_F are logically equivalent. This means either both are true or both are false.

3.  Relationship between S_A and S_E (or S_F): S_A is ""X=F or X=H"". S_E is ""X!=F and X!=H"". These two statements are contradictory. If S_A is true, then S_E must be false. If S_A is false, then S_E must be true. The same holds for S_A and S_F.

Let's consider the group of four statements {S_A, S_H, S_E, S_F}:
*   Since S_A and S_H are equivalent, they are either both true or both false.
*   Since S_E and S_F are equivalent, they are either both true or both false.
*   Since S_A and S_E are contradictory:
    *   Case 1: S_A is true. Then S_H is true. Since S_A is true, S_E must be false, and S_F must be false. In this case, we have (True, True, False, False) for (S_A, S_H, S_E, S_F). This gives 2 true statements from this group.
    *   Case 2: S_A is false. Then S_H is false. Since S_A is false, S_E must be true, and S_F must be true. In this case, we have (False, False, True, True) for (S_A, S_H, S_E, S_F). This gives 2 true statements from this group.
*   In both possible cases, exactly two statements from the group {S_A, S_H, S_E, S_F} are true.

We are given that exactly three statements are true overall. Since two of these true statements come from {S_A, S_H, S_E, S_F}, the remaining 3 - 2 = 1 true statement must come from the other four statements: {S_B, S_C, S_D, S_G}.

Let's analyze the group of four statements {S_B, S_C, S_D, S_G}:
S_B: ""B is first."" (X=B)
S_C: ""G is first."" (X=G)
S_D: ""B is not first."" (X!=B)
S_G: ""C is not first."" (X!=C)

1.  Relationship between S_B and S_D: S_B states ""X=B"" and S_D states ""X!=B"". These two statements are contradictory. Therefore, exactly one of S_B and S_D must be true.

2.  We established that exactly one statement from the group {S_B, S_C, S_D, S_G} is true. Since exactly one of S_B and S_D is true, this means that the other two statements, S_C and S_G, must both be false.

Now we use the falsity of S_C and S_G to determine X:
*   S_C: ""G is first"" (X=G). Since S_C is false, it means X!=G.
*   S_G: ""C is not first"" (X!=C). Since S_G is false, it means the statement ""X!=C"" is false, which implies X=C.

So, from this logical deduction, C must be the person who got first place.

Let's verify this result by checking the truth value of each statement if X=C:
*   S_A: ""F is first or H is first"" (C=F or C=H). False.
*   S_B: ""B is first"" (C=B). False.
*   S_C: ""G is first"" (C=G). False. (This is consistent with our deduction that S_C is false)
*   S_D: ""B is not first"" (C!=B). True.
*   S_E: ""A is wrong"" (S_A is false, so E says False is false, which is True). True. (S_A is ""C=F or C=H"", which is False. So S_E is True.)
*   S_F: ""Neither I nor H is the first"" (C!=F and C!=H). True.
*   S_G: ""C is not first"" (C!=C). False. (This is consistent with our deduction that S_G is false, as C=C)
*   S_H: ""I agree with A"" (Same as S_A). False.

Counting the true statements if C is first:
S_A: False
S_B: False
S_C: False
S_D: True
S_E: True
S_F: True
S_G: False
S_H: False

The true statements are S_D, S_E, and S_F. There are exactly 3 true statements. This matches the condition given in the problem.
The breakdown of true statements is:
From {S_A, S_H, S_E, S_F}: S_A (F), S_H (F), S_E (T), S_F (T). Two are true. This is consistent with Case 2 described above.
From {S_B, S_C, S_D, S_G}: S_B (F), S_C (F), S_D (T), S_G (F). One is true (S_D). This is consistent. S_B is false so S_D is true. S_C and S_G are false.

The logical deduction leads to C as the first-place winner, and this solution fits all the conditions.

Final Answer: C got first.",True
249,"Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry).

About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)

8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West

I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False
20,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.
Finally, we have Caleb and Derec to fill the first and last spots.  Caleb and Nora share a birth position.  The first paragraph mentions that Cogita is Nora's older sister, so Caleb cannot be the firstborn.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False
24,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated","Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.

11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks.

5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.

Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12.","Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?","On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. ","The Order the finished in was: Ben, Paul, Jessica, Stephen, Brianna, Clark, Luke, Anna, Kelsey, Felicia, Brad, Abby.
Here is how they got there:
On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.
On the third lap the 10th and 11th place people switched spots, putting Kelsey in 10th, and Felicia in 11th. 5th and 6th place switched, making Brianna in 5th, and Clark in 6th, and the 7th and 8th place people switched, putting Luke in 7th and Anna in 8th. Brad was passed by the two people who were directly behind him which made Kelsey in 9th, Felicia in 10th, and Brad in 11th. Jessica was also passed by Paul, the person directly behind her, putting Paul in 2nd, and Jessica in 3rd.
Their new ranks are:

1. The sum of the top row is greater than the sum of the middle row, which is greater than the sum of the bottom row.
2. E is a prime factor of G.
3. F is greater than A.
4. The sum of B and G is equal to H.
5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

FKO are interchangeable, and can be arranged 6 ways. FKO stays together unless N is next to M outside GLM (more on that below).

GLM has 1 slot in the above configuration (G next to FKO, opposite JH).
2[JH]*6[FKO]*1[MLG]=12 arrangements, or 2 mirror groups of 6 arrangements each. Thus, 6 distinct arrangements - 1 for each FKO order.
Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML. If N is between FKO and GLM, GLM can scramble, and G can be anywhere touching FKO, except N cannot touch L. When G-[L/M]-N are consecutive in either direction, FKO can straddle that subgroup.

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):

Therefore, X is not 2, so statements 2 and 3 are both true because the ""if"" part is not satisfied.
Therefore, statement 6 must be true, because if X is less than 3, we know X must be 2. In this case, statement 5 is false.

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False
58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.

At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field
-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.
The shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False
61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.

2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.

If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?","Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
So now, knowing that the killer's sister is COUSIN to Bo, Bill's NIECE, and Bob's GRANDDAUGHTER, the killer must be BERNIE.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.

Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.", it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true,"Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years
Tolo, 12 hands, 120 years
Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

104,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)

(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.

Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff and Hayden Seek participated in the POOL competition.
FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",Take large advantage of the 15 balls total rule,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:

-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon

-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.

Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false.

A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:

Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.

Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.

2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).","The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

129,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.

Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Keep in mind that for example, if you find a chapter number for a title, the other chapter numbers can NOT have that title, so that gives you another answer to mark off to narrow the correct answer down.","Answers:
Chapter 1 -- ""Jung At Heart"" -- Caleb
Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

148,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

149,"Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. is in a play with four relatives: his sister, mother, son, and daughter. Each of the five has a different dressing room:

Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter

150,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

You will need to draw out a rectangular 2 x 4 grid (A - D on top, E - H on bottom) with the center line representing a row of tables in order to help determine who was in what position on the dance floor.
Positions:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
Boys:  Bill, Curt, Danny, Donald, George, Ricky, Steve, Tony
Girls:  Cindy, Jenny, Laurie, Laverne, Nancy, Sheryl, Veronica, Wendy

Songs:  ""Let's Twist Again"",  ""The Peppermint Twist"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""Twist, Twist, Senora"", ""The Twist"", ""Twistin' USA"", ""Twisting the Night Away"", ""Dear Lady Twist""
1.  Bill and his partner aren't the couple representing Washington High (which isn't Laurie's school).  Neither George (who isn't dancing with Wendy) nor Tony attends Roosevelt High.
2.  The couples in positions C, F, and H requested ""Twist and Shout"", ""Dear Lady Twist,"" and ""Twistin' USA"", in some order.  The couple from Lakewood High, who requested ""Twist and Shout"", isn't in position F.
3.  Donald and his partner (who aren't the Oceanside High students) requested ""The Peppermint Twist"".  Wendy and her partner requested ""Twisting the Night Away"".  Cindy and her partner (who attend Lincoln High) requested ""Twistin' USA"".
4.  Curt and his partner, the Roosevelt High couple, and Sheryl and her partner are all dancing on the same side of the tables.
5.  Ricky and the couple from Roosevelt High are dancing at diagonally opposite ends of the restaurant.  Bill and the Twist champions from Jefferson High are the other pairs dancing at diagonally opposite ends of the restaurant.
6.  Couples A, D, E, and H are Laverne and her partner, Jenny and her partner, the couple who attend Washington high, and the ones who requested ""Twist, Twist Senora"", in some order.
7.  Sheryl isn't immediately next to either Nancy or her partner or Laverne and her partner.  Cindy is immediately next to, and due right of, Steve and his partner.

163,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.

As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.

166,"Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".","Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.

No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand.

3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.

5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change. ","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

199,"I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.","First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","Statements A and C must be true.

3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Round 2    6           4
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

214,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:
1. heart, heart, club
spade, spade, club
diamond, diamond, club
2. heart, heart, diamond
spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
3. spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
4. spade, spade, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
club, club, diamond
5. diamond, diamond, heart
club, club, heart
spade, spade, heart
6. diamond, diamond, spade
club, club, spade
heart, heart, spade
Game 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit. Games 5 and 6 cannot be possible because no one had both hearts and spades. This leaves only games 2, 3, and 4, which all have diamonds as the high suit.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,,False

During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present.

How many people did you know?",Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.,"Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person.

Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married.

In this scenario, Kate would have lost 15 times ($15) and won 4 times ($8), for a net loss of $7.  Since she now has $20, she must have started with $27.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"**1. Understand the Setup**
- Three people: Kevin, Kate, Kathy.
- They bet $1 each weekday in March, starting Monday, March 3rd.
- Kevin bets on 2 doughnuts, Kate on 3, Kathy on 3.5.
- Only one person can win each day (if the number matches their bet). If the number doesn't match any of their bets, no one wins.
- Final amount for each person at the end of March (by April) is $20.
- We need to find the maximum possible initial amount for any person at the beginning of March.

**2. Determine the Number of Betting Days (D)**
- The betting happens on weekdays (Monday to Friday) in March, starting from March 3rd.
- We need to count the number of weekdays from March 3rd to March 31st, inclusive.
- March 3rd was a Monday.
- Weekdays:
    - March 3 - 7 (Mon - Fri): 5 days
    - March 10 - 14 (Mon - Fri): 5 days
    - March 17 - 21 (Mon - Fri): 5 days
    - March 24 - 28 (Mon - Fri): 5 days
    - March 31 (Mon): 1 day
- Total number of betting days, D = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 21 days.

**3. Define Variables and Relationships for Wins**
- Let K_w be the number of times Kevin won (boss ate 2 doughnuts).
- Let Kt_w be the number of times Kate won (boss ate 3 doughnuts).
- Let Ky_w be the number of times Kathy won (boss ate 3.5 doughnuts).
- The problem states:
    - Kathy won twice as many times as Kevin: Ky_w = 2 * K_w
    - Kevin won once more than Kate: K_w = Kt_w + 1, which implies Kt_w = K_w - 1.
- The number of wins must be non-negative integers.
    - K_w >= 0
    - Kt_w >= 0 => K_w - 1 >= 0 => K_w >= 1
    - Ky_w >= 0 => 2 * K_w >= 0 => K_w >= 0
- Therefore, K_w must be a positive integer (K_w >= 1).

**4. Determine the Total Number of Wins and Constraints**
- Total number of days someone won = K_w + Kt_w + Ky_w
- Substituting the relationships: Total wins = K_w + (K_w - 1) + (2 * K_w) = 4 * K_w - 1.
- The total number of betting days is D = 21.
- The problem states ""sometimes there was no winner"". This means the total number of wins must be strictly less than the total number of betting days.
- Total wins < D
- 4 * K_w - 1 < 21
- 4 * K_w < 22
- K_w < 22 / 4
- K_w < 5.5
- Since K_w must be an integer and K_w >= 1, the possible values for K_w are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

**5. Calculate Net Change in Money for Each Person**
- Each day, each of the 3 people bets $1. The total pot is $3.
- When a person wins, they collect the $3 pot. Their net gain for that day is $3 (won) - $1 (bet) = $2.
- When a person doesn't win, they lose their $1 bet. Their net change for that day is -$1.
- Over the D = 21 days, let W be the number of wins for a specific person. The number of days they did not win is D - W = 21 - W.
- Net Change = (W * $2) + ((21 - W) * -$1) = 2W - (21 - W) = 2W - 21 + W = 3W - 21.
Alternatively: Total amount spent = $1 * D = $21. Total amount won = W * $3 (pot). Net Change = (W * $3) - $21 = 3W - 21.

- Kevin's Net Change = 3 * K_w - 21
- Kate's Net Change = 3 * Kt_w - 21 = 3 * (K_w - 1) - 21 = 3K_w - 3 - 21 = 3K_w - 24
- Kathy's Net Change = 3 * Ky_w - 21 = 3 * (2 * K_w) - 21 = 6K_w - 21

**6. Calculate Initial Amount for Each Person**
- Let S_initial be the initial amount and S_final be the final amount ($20).
- S_initial + Net Change = S_final
- S_initial = S_final - Net Change = $20 - Net Change

- Kevin's Initial Amount = $20 - (3K_w - 21) = 20 - 3K_w + 21 = 41 - 3K_w
- Kate's Initial Amount = $20 - (3K_w - 24) = 20 - 3K_w + 24 = 44 - 3K_w
- Kathy's Initial Amount = $20 - (6K_w - 21) = 20 - 6K_w + 21 = 41 - 6K_w

**7. Evaluate Initial Amounts for Each Possible Value of K_w**
We calculate the initial amounts for each person for K_w = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

- **Case K_w = 1:**
    - Kevin's Initial = 41 - 3(1) = $38
    - Kate's Initial = 44 - 3(1) = $41
    - Kathy's Initial = 41 - 6(1) = $35
    - (Wins: K=1, Kt=0, Ky=2. Total=3 < 21. Valid)

- **Case K_w = 2:**
    - Kevin's Initial = 41 - 3(2) = 41 - 6 = $35
    - Kate's Initial = 44 - 3(2) = 44 - 6 = $38
    - Kathy's Initial = 41 - 6(2) = 41 - 12 = $29
    - (Wins: K=2, Kt=1, Ky=4. Total=7 < 21. Valid)

- **Case K_w = 3:**
    - Kevin's Initial = 41 - 3(3) = 41 - 9 = $32
    - Kate's Initial = 44 - 3(3) = 44 - 9 = $35
    - Kathy's Initial = 41 - 6(3) = 41 - 18 = $23
    - (Wins: K=3, Kt=2, Ky=6. Total=11 < 21. Valid)

- **Case K_w = 4:**
    - Kevin's Initial = 41 - 3(4) = 41 - 12 = $29
    - Kate's Initial = 44 - 3(4) = 44 - 12 = $32
    - Kathy's Initial = 41 - 6(4) = 41 - 24 = $17
    - (Wins: K=4, Kt=3, Ky=8. Total=15 < 21. Valid)

- **Case K_w = 5:**
    - Kevin's Initial = 41 - 3(5) = 41 - 15 = $26
    - Kate's Initial = 44 - 3(5) = 44 - 15 = $29
    - Kathy's Initial = 41 - 6(5) = 41 - 30 = $11
    - (Wins: K=5, Kt=4, Ky=10. Total=19 < 21. Valid)

**8. Find the Maximum Possible Initial Amount**
We need to find the maximum value among all calculated initial amounts for Kevin, Kate, and Kathy across all valid cases (K_w = 1 to 5).
The possible initial amounts are:
{$38, $41, $35} for K_w=1
{$35, $38, $29} for K_w=2
{$32, $35, $23} for K_w=3
{$29, $32, $17} for K_w=4
{$26, $29, $11} for K_w=5

The set of all possible initial amounts is {$11, $17, $23, $26, $29, $29, $32, $32, $35, $35, $35, $38, $38, $41}.
The maximum value in this set is $41.

This maximum occurred when K_w = 1, and it was Kate's initial amount. In this scenario, Kevin won once, Kate won zero times, and Kathy won twice. The net changes were -$18 (Kevin), -$21 (Kate), -$15 (Kathy), leading to final amounts of $38-$18=$20, $41-$21=$20, and $35-$15=$20, respectively. All conditions are satisfied.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{41}$",True
221,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:

B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.

The one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.
There are only 3 truthful statements.
If Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.
If Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.
If Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.
In Robby's case, in detail:

B False
Nobby A True
B False
Morris A False

It's also stated that it was not clear which guard was on duty, implying a single guard was on duty that evening. Therefore, exactly one of the four guards is guilty. So, D(X) is true for exactly one guard X.

Let's list the statements made by each guard:
Norris McDim (N):
NA: I did not leave the door open (not D(N))
NB: Morris was the one who did it (D(M))

Nobby Shifty (S):
SA: I was not the one who was on duty that evening (not D(S))

MB: I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.

Robby O'Mental (R):
RA: I did not leave the door open (not D(R))
RB: I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.

We need to evaluate the truthfulness of statements MB and RB based on the problem's narrative.

For RB: The problem states, ""Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments."" It also says, ""many of whom [the guards] had followed Torks' teachings.""
If Robby followed Torks' teachings, he would know Torks' philosophy and thus would not be surprised that Torks didn't escape. In this case, RB would be True.
If Robby did not follow Torks' teachings (the problem says ""many"", not ""all""), he might not know this philosophy. Since all guards (including Robby) hoped",True
222,"John, Pete, Tom, George, and Steve are brothers. One day, one of them broke a window. When their father asked them who did it, they gave the following answers:

Who broke the window?","If you find it difficult to use logic alone, then use trial and error by assuming each one of the five sons broke the window, and list whether they are telling a lie or the truth.","By assuming that each of the five brothers broke the window and seeing how many told the truth, only Tom can be the person who broke the window.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let J, P, T, G, S represent the five brothers: John, Pete, Tom, George, and Steve, respectively.
Let X be the brother who broke the window. X must be one of {J, P, T, G, S}.
Let $v(B)$ denote the truth value of the statement made by brother B, where $v(B)=True$ if the statement is true, and $v(B)=False$ if the statement is false.

The statements are:
1.  John (J): ""It was Pete or Tom.""
    $v(J) \iff (X=P \lor X=T)$
2.  Pete (P): ""It was neither George nor me.""
    $v(P) \iff (X \neq G \land X \neq P)$
3.  Tom (T): ""Both of you [John and Pete] are lying.""
    $v(T) \iff (\neg v(J) \land \neg v(P))$
4.  Steve (S): ""No, only one of them [John and Pete] is lying."" (This means exactly one of John and Pete is telling the truth).

5.  George (G): ""No, Steve, you are wrong.""
    $v(G) \iff \neg v(S)$

Mother's statement: Exactly three of the five brothers are telling the truth.
$|\{B \in \{J, P, T, G, S\} \mid v(B) = True\}| = 3$

We can analyze the relationships between the truth values of the statements.
From statement 5, $v(G) = \neg v(S)$. This means exactly one of George and Steve is telling the truth.
From statement 4, $v(S) = v(J) \oplus v(P)$. This means Steve tells the truth if and only if John and Pete have different truth values.
From statement 3, $v(T) = \neg v(J) \land \neg v(P)$. This means Tom tells the truth if and only if both John and Pete are lying.

Let's consider the possible truth value combinations for John's statement ($v(J)$) and Pete's statement ($v(P)$), and determine the resulting truth values for T, S, and G, and the total number of truth-tellers.

Case 1: $v(J)=True$ and $v(P)=True$.
- $v(T) = \neg v(J) \land \neg v(P) = \neg True \land \neg True = False \land False = False$.
- $v(S) = v(J) \oplus v(P) = True \oplus True = False$.
- $v(G) = \neg v(S) = \neg False = True$.
- The set of truth-tellers is {J, P, G}. The number of truth-tellers is 3.
- This case is consistent with the mother's statement.
- Let's find X for this case:
    - $v(J)=True \implies X=P \lor X=T$.
    - $v(P)=True \implies X \neq G \land X \neq P$.
    - Combining these conditions: $(X=P \lor X=T) \land (X \neq G \land X \neq P)$.
    - Since $X \neq P$, the condition $X=P \lor X=T$ can only be satisfied if $X=T$.
    - Let's check if $X=T$ satisfies $X \neq G \land X \neq P$. $T \neq G$ is true, and $T \neq P$ is true. So, $X=T$ is consistent.
    - In this case, Tom broke the window.

Case 2: $v(J)=True$ and $v(P)=False$.
- $v(T) = \neg v(J) \land \neg v(P) = \neg True \land \neg False = False \land True = False$.
- $v(S) = v(J) \oplus v(P) = True \oplus False = True$.
- $v(G) = \neg v(S) = \neg True = False$.
- The set of truth-tellers is {J, S}. The number of truth-tellers is 2.
- This case contradicts the mother's statement.

Case 3: $v(J)=False$ and $v(P)=True$.
- $v(T) = \neg v(J) \land \neg v(P) = \neg False \land \neg True = True \land False = False$.
- $v(S) = v(J) \oplus v(P) = False \oplus True = True$.
- $v(G) = \neg v(S) = \neg True = False$.
- The set of truth-tellers is {P, S}. The number of truth-tellers is 2.
- This case contradicts the mother's statement.

Case 4: $v(J)=False$ and $v(P)=False$.
- $v(T) = \neg v(J) \land \neg v(P) = \neg False \land \neg False = True \land True = True$.
- $v(S) = v(J) \oplus v(P) = False \oplus False = False$.
- $v(G) = \neg v(S) = \neg False = True$.
- The set of truth-tellers is {T, G}. The number of truth-tellers is 2.
- This case contradicts the mother's statement.

The only case consistent with the mother's statement (exactly 3 truth-tellers) is Case 1, where $v(J)=True$, $v(P)=True$, $v(T)=False$, $v(S)=False$, and $v(G)=True$.
In this case, the logical deduction based on $v(J)=True$ and $v(P)=True$ led to the conclusion that $X=T$.

Let's verify this conclusion: If Tom (T) broke the window:
- John's statement: ""It was Pete or Tom."" (X=P or X=T). Since X=T, this is True. ($v(J)=True$)

- Tom's statement: ""Both John and Pete are lying."" ($v(J)=False$ and $v(P)=False$). Since $v(J)=True$ and $v(P)=True$, this statement is False. ($v(T)=False$)
- Steve's statement: ""Only one of John and Pete is lying."" ($v(J) \oplus v(P)$). Since $v(J)=True$ and $v(P)=True$, this is $True \oplus True = False$. ($v(S)=False$)

The other two add up to 8, which is obtained by 8+0.
Therefore, A, the biggest number of the three, is 8.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let the ten distinct digits be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, which must be a permutation of {0, 1, ..., 9}.

The conditions are:
1.  A > B > C
2.  D > E > F
3.  G > H > I > J
4.  D, E, F are consecutive even digits.
    The even digits are {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.
    Possible sets for {D, E, F}, in decreasing order:
    -   {4, 2, 0}

5.  G, H, I, J are consecutive odd digits.

    Possible sets for {G, H, I, J}, in decreasing order:

    -   {9, 7, 5, 3} (J, I, H, G would be 3,5,7,9)

Let S_DEF be the set {D,E,F} and S_GHIJ be the set {G,H,I,J}.
There are 3 choices for S_DEF and 2 choices for S_GHIJ, leading to 3*2=6 cases for the combined set S_DEF U S_GHIJ.

Case 1: S_DEF = {4,2,0} and S_GHIJ = {7,5,3,1}.
    Used digits: {0,1,2,3,4,5,7}.
    Remaining digits for {A,B,C}: {6,8,9}.
    In decreasing order, this is A=9, B=8, C=6.

Case 3: S_DEF = {6,4,2} and S_GHIJ = {7,5,3,1}.
    Used digits: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.
    Remaining digits for {A,B,C}: {0,8,9}.
    In decreasing order, this is A=9, B=8, C=0.

    Sum A+B+C = 8+1+0 = 9. This is a valid sum.

225,"There are three brothers: Al, Ben, and Carl. Two of the three brothers are boxers. Here are some facts:

2. The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.
3. The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.
Which brother is not a boxer?",Try to come up with a potential ordering of their heights and ages. ,"Carl is not a boxer.
From fact 1, we know that Carl is not the older boxer.
From fact 3, we know that Ben is not the younger boxer.
We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.
If scenario 2 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al; fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al, making Ben shorter than Carl.
If scenario 3 is true, fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al.
We can now expand our three scenarios:
1. Al is the younger, taller boxer, and Ben is the older, shorter boxer.
2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.
Fact 2 also tells us that Al is not the shorter boxer, so scenario 3 cannot be possible, either.
Therefore, scenario 1 is true, which means that Carl is not a boxer.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let A, B, and C represent Al, Ben, and Carl, respectively.
Let H(X) denote the height of brother X and Age(X) denote the age of brother X.
There are three brothers, and two of them are boxers. Let BX be the set of boxers, so |BX| = 2. One brother is not a boxer.
The problem refers to an ""older boxer"" and a ""younger boxer"". Let these be B_old and B_young, respectively. This implies the two boxers have different ages, with Age(B_old) > Age(B_young). The set of boxers is BX = {B_old, B_young}.
The problem refers to a ""shorter boxer"" and implies a ""taller boxer"". Let these be B_short and B_tall, respectively. This implies the two boxers have different heights, with H(B_short) < H(B_tall). The set of boxers is also BX = {B_short, B_tall}.

Let's analyze the three given facts:
Fact 1: The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.
This means we compare H(A) and H(B).
If H(A) < H(B), then Al is shorter, so A = B_old.
If H(B) < H(A), then Ben is shorter, so B = B_old.
This tells us that the older boxer must be either Al or Ben. B_old ∈ {A, B}. Carl cannot be the older boxer.

Fact 2: The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.
This means we compare Age(B) and Age(C).
If Age(B) < Age(C), then Ben is younger, so B = B_short.
If Age(C) < Age(B), then Carl is younger, so C = B_short.
This tells us that the shorter boxer must be either Ben or Carl. B_short ∈ {B, C}. Al cannot be the shorter boxer.

Fact 3: The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.
This means we compare H(A) and H(C).
If H(A) > H(C), then Al is taller, so A = B_young.
If H(C) > H(A), then Carl is taller, so C = B_young.
This tells us that the younger boxer must be either Al or Carl. B_young ∈ {A, C}. Ben cannot be the younger boxer.

The set of boxers is {B_old, B_young}. We know B_old ∈ {A, B} and B_young ∈ {A, C}.
Since the older boxer and younger boxer must be distinct people (Age(B_old) > Age(B_young)), B_old ≠ B_young.
We can enumerate the possible pairs for {B_old, B_young}:
Possibility 1: B_old = A and B_young = C. The boxers are Al and Carl. {A, C}. This implies Ben is not a boxer. It also implies Age(A) > Age(C).
Possibility 2: B_old = B and B_young = A. The boxers are Ben and Al. {B, A}. This implies Carl is not a boxer. It also implies Age(B) > Age(A).
Possibility 3: B_old = B and B_young = C. The boxers are Ben and Carl. {B, C}. This implies Al is not a boxer. It also implies Age(B) > Age(C).
(The case B_old = A and B_young = A is impossible because B_old ≠ B_young).

Let's examine each possibility to see if it is consistent with all the facts.
Case 1: Boxers are A and C. B is not a boxer. B_old = A, B_young = C. Age(A) > Age(C).
From Fact 1, since A = B_old, it must be that A is the shorter of A and B. So H(A) < H(B).
From Fact 3, since C = B_young, it must be that C is the taller of A and C. So H(C) > H(A).
The boxers are A and C, so {B_short, B_tall} = {A, C}.
From Fact 2, B_short ∈ {B, C}. Since B is not a boxer, B_short cannot be B. Therefore, B_short = C.
If C = B_short, then A = B_tall, which means H(C) < H(A).
This contradicts the conclusion from Fact 3 (H(C) > H(A)).
Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Case 2: Boxers are A and B. C is not a boxer. B_old = B, B_young = A. Age(B) > Age(A).
From Fact 1, since B = B_old, it must be that B is the shorter of A and B. So H(B) < H(A).
From Fact 3, since A = B_young, it must be that A is the taller of A and C. So H(A) > H(C).
The boxers are A and B, so {B_short, B_tall} = {A, B}.
From Fact 2, B_short ∈ {B, C}. Since C is not a boxer, B_short cannot be C. Therefore, B_short = B.
If B = B_short, then A = B_tall, which means H(B) < H(A). This is consistent with the conclusion from Fact 1.
Fact 2 also states that the younger of B and C is B_short (which is B). So Age(B) < Age(C).
Combining the age relations: Age(A) < Age(B) (since B=B_old, A=B_young) and Age(B) < Age(C). So Age(A) < Age(B) < Age(C).
Combining the height relations: H(B) < H(A) (from Fact 1 and Fact 2) and H(C) < H(A) (from Fact 3).
Let's check if these derived relations are fully consistent with the original facts.
Fact 1: The shorter of A and B (which is B, since H(B) < H(A)) is the older boxer (B_old = B). This is true.
Fact 2: The younger of B and C (which is B, since Age(B) < Age(C)) is the shorter boxer (B_short = B). This is true.
Fact 3: The taller of A and C (which is A, since H(A) > H(C)) is the younger boxer (B_young = A). This is true.
All facts are consistent with this scenario. So Case 2 is possible, and Carl (C) is not a boxer.

Case 3: Boxers are B and C. A is not a boxer. B_old = B, B_young = C. Age(B) > Age(C).
From Fact 1, since B = B_old, it must be that B is the shorter of A and B. So H(B) < H(A).
From Fact 3, since C = B_young, it must be that C is the taller of A and C. So H(C) > H(A).
The boxers are B and C, so {B_short, B_tall} = {B, C}.
From Fact 2, B_short ∈ {B, C}. This condition does not eliminate anyone immediately.
Fact 2 also states that the younger of B and C is B_short. Since Age(B) > Age(C), C is the younger of B and C. So C = B_short.
If C = B_short, then B = B_tall, which means H(C) < H(B).
Let's summarize the height relations derived: H(B) < H(A) (from Fact 1), H(C) > H(A) (from Fact 3), and H(C) < H(B) (from Fact 2).
From H(C) < H(B) and H(B) < H(A), we can deduce H(C) < H(A).
However, from Fact 3 we derived H(C) > H(A). This is a contradiction.
Therefore, Case 3 is impossible.

Only Case 2 is consistent with all the given facts. In Case 2, the boxers are Al (A) and Ben (B), and Carl (C) is not a boxer.

Final check:
Let A, B, C be Al, Ben, Carl.
Suppose Boxers are A, B. C is not a boxer.
Ages: Let Age(A)=20, Age(B)=25, Age(C)=30.
Heights: Let H(A)=180cm, H(B)=170cm, H(C)=175cm.
Boxers: A and B. B_old = B (older boxer, Age 25 > 20), B_young = A (younger boxer).
Heights of boxers: H(A)=180, H(B)=170. B_short = B (shorter boxer, 170 < 180), B_tall = A.
Check facts:
1. The shorter of A and B is H(B) = 170cm, which is B. Is B the older boxer? Yes, B_old = B. Check.
2. The younger of B and C is Age(B)=25 < Age(C)=30, which is B. Is B the shorter boxer? Yes, B_short = B. Check.
3. The taller of A and C is H(A)=180 > H(C)=175, which is A. Is A the younger boxer? Yes, B_young = A. Check.
The example is consistent.

231,"There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire.

With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Here is a step-by-step method for how Carlo could steal the diamond without triggering the alarm:

1.  **Analyze the Constraints:** The primary challenge is the alarm system under the carpet. Wires are spaced 8 cm apart, and any single wire subjected to more than 4 kg of force will trigger the alarm. Carlo weighs 74 kg. Standing or walking directly on the carpet would concentrate his weight on too few wires, triggering the alarm (as calculated: he needs to distribute his weight over at least 74 kg / 4 kg/wire = 18.5 wires).

2.  **Utilize the Equipment for Weight Distribution:** The 5-meter long 2x4 board is the key piece of equipment for distributing weight. To maximize the number of wires crossed, the board must be placed perpendicular to the direction of the wires. Let's estimate the board's weight as approximately 10 kg (based on typical wood density and dimensions). The board's width (approx. 3.5 inches or 8.9 cm) is less critical than its length for crossing wires when placed perpendicularly.

3.  **Prepare the Equipment:** Carlo uses the saw to cut the 5-meter board into two equal lengths of 2.5 meters each. Each piece weighs approximately 5 kg. The 2.5-meter length is still sufficient to distribute weight below the alarm threshold. He might use the leather straps and hammer to create loop handles on the ends or middle of the board pieces for easier carrying and maneuvering during the leapfrog process.

4.  **Determine Wire Direction:** Carlo must first determine the direction of the parallel alarm wires. The method is not specified, but it's a necessary prerequisite. He might do this near the edge of the room by carefully probing the carpet (perhaps using the hammer handle gently or a small offcut of wood) or by looking for subtle visual cues. Let's assume Carlo determines the wires run parallel to one set of walls (e.g., North-South).

5.  **Calculate Weight Distribution per Wire:** A 2.5-meter (250 cm) board placed perpendicular to wires spaced 8 cm apart will cross N = 250 cm / 8 cm = 31.25 wires. Let's use N=31 wires for a conservative estimate.
    *   When Carlo (74 kg) stands on one board (5 kg), the total weight is 79 kg. The force per wire is 79 kg / 31 wires ≈ 2.55 kg/wire. This is below the 4 kg threshold.
    *   When Carlo (74 kg) stands on one board (5 kg) and holds the other board (5 kg), the total weight is 84 kg. The force per wire is 84 kg / 31 wires ≈ 2.71 kg/wire. This is also below the 4 kg threshold.

6.  **Execute the Leapfrog Maneuver:**
    *   Carlo chooses an entry point at the midpoint of a wall that is perpendicular to the direction of the wires. If wires run N-S, he starts at the West wall (x=0) at the room's midpoint along that wall (y=7.5m).
    *   He lays the first 2.5m board (B1) on the carpet, perpendicular to the wires (i.e., in the E-W direction), extending from the wall (x=0) to x=2.5m.
    *   He carefully steps onto B1 and walks towards its far end (x=2.5m).
    *   He places the second 2.5m board (B2) ahead of B1, extending from x=2.5m to x=5.0m.
    *   He steps onto B2.
    *   He turns around carefully, retrieves B1 (possibly using the strap handles for easier reach and lift).
    *   He turns forward again, walks to the front end of B2 (x=5.0m), carrying B1.
    *   He places B1 ahead of B2, extending from x=5.0m to x=7.5m.
    *   He steps onto B1. The front end of B1 is now precisely at the center of the room (x=7.5m, y=7.5m), where the pedestal is located.

7.  **Access the Diamond:** Carlo is now standing on the board (B1) at the base of the 1-meter high pedestal. He can now attempt to retrieve the diamond from the glass cube on top of the pedestal. The hammer could potentially be used to break the glass cube, assuming this action doesn't trigger other unspecified alarms.

8.  **Exit the Room:** Carlo can exit the room by reversing the leapfrog process, moving the boards back towards his entry point.

**Conclusion:** Yes, Carlo could steal the diamond without triggering the floor alarm. The method involves cutting the board in two, determining the wire direction, using the boards perpendicular to the wires to distribute his weight below the 4 kg per wire threshold, and employing a leapfrog technique to reach the center of the room. The saw is essential for cutting the board. The straps and hammer are potentially useful for handling the boards and accessing the diamond within the glass cube.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Yes, Carlo can steal the diamond. He can saw the 5m board into two 2.5m sections. After determining the direction of the alarm wires, he places one section perpendicular to the wires, steps onto it, places the second section in front of the first, and steps onto the second section. He then retrieves the first section, moves it in front of the second section, and steps onto it. By repeating this leapfrog process, ensuring the boards are always perpendicular to the wires, he distributes his weight (plus the board's weight) over approximately 31 wires (250cm / 8cm/wire = 31.25 wires). The maximum force per wire would be when he is holding the second board, totaling approximately 84 kg (74kg Carlo + 5kg board + 5kg board), resulting in about 2.71 kg per wire (84kg / 31 wires), which is below the 4 kg trigger threshold. This allows him to reach the pedestal in the center of the room. The hammer can be used to break the glass cube, and the straps could be fashioned into handles for the boards.}$",True

To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.

Beethoven's Wig has been stolen again!  Instead of hiding it in a box, the enemy, who remains anonymous, has hidden it inside one of four castles.  Each castle is located in a different fantasyland and has a creature guarding its gates.  Use the clues below to put the lands in order (1st,2nd,3rd, and 4th), figure out which castle belongs in which land, which creature belong to which castle, and help Beethoven reclaim his wig!
Object: Beethoven's Wig
Fantasylands: Lothlorien, Mordor, Narnia, and Malacandra.
Creatures: Dragon, Troll, Giant, and Balrog.
Castles: Stone, Gold, Glass, and Silver.
1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
4.  The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
5.  The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
6.  Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
7.  The Troll is not at the Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.",Mordor and Lothlorien must be at the edges of the sequence,"Mordor is the first fantasyland.  It contains the Giant and the Silver Castle.
Narnia is the second land.  It has the Dragon, the Golden Castle, and the Wig.
Malacandra is the third land.  It has the Stone Castle and the Balrog.
Lothlorien is the fourth land.  It contains the Troll and the Glass Castle.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Here is the step-by-step deduction:

1.  **Identify the elements:** We have 4 positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, left to right), 4 Fantasylands (Lothlorien (L), Mordor (M), Narnia (N), Malacandra (Ma)), 4 Creatures (Dragon (D), Troll (T), Giant (G), Balrog (B)), 4 Castles (Stone (St), Gold (Go), Glass (Gl), Silver (Si)), and the Wig (W).

2.  **Analyze Clue 4:** ""The Balrog (B) is not in Lothlorien (L), but he stays at the Stone Castle (St)."" This tells us B = St.
3.  **Analyze Clue 2:** ""The Stone Castle (St) is to the right of the Wig (W < St), and is placed at either Malacandra (Ma) or Lothlorien (L)."" So St is at Ma or L.
4.  **Combine Clues 2 and 4:** Since B = St, and St is at Ma or L, B is at Ma or L. Clue 4 also states B ≠ L. Therefore, the Balrog (B) must be at Malacandra (Ma). Consequently, the Stone Castle (St) is also at Malacandra (Ma). So, B = St = Ma.
5.  **Deduce from Clue 2:** W < St. Since St = Ma is at position `p_Ma`, W < `p_Ma`. The Wig is to the left of Malacandra. Malacandra cannot be in position 1.
6.  **Analyze Clue 1:** ""Narnia (N) is to the left of Lothlorien (L)"" (N < L). ""Lothlorien (L) is to the right of the Balrog (B)"" (B < L). Since B = Ma, we have Ma < L. Malacandra is to the left of Lothlorien.
7.  **Determine positions for Ma and L:** Ma cannot be position 1 (from step 5). Ma < L.
    *   If Ma is 2, L can be 3 or 4.
    *   If Ma is 3, L must be 4.
    *   If Ma is 4, Ma < L is impossible.
    So, Ma is at position 2 or 3. L is at position 3 or 4.
8.  **Analyze Clue 6:** ""Mordor (M) is to the left of the Dragon (D)"" (M < D). ""The Dragon (D) stays at the second place."" This definitively places the Dragon (D) at position 2. It also implies Mordor (M) must be at position 1.
9.  **Re-evaluate positions for Ma and L using Clue 6:** We know the creature at position 2 is D. From step 4, B = Ma. Therefore, Ma cannot be at position 2 (since B ≠ D). This eliminates the Ma=2 case from step 7.
10. **Confirm positions for Ma and L:** Ma must be at position 3. Since Ma < L, L must be at position 4. We already know M is at position 1. The remaining land, Narnia (N), must be at position 2.
11. **Current Land Order:** Position 1: Mordor (M), Position 2: Narnia (N), Position 3: Malacandra (Ma), Position 4: Lothlorien (L).
12. **Check Land Order consistency:**
    *   N < L (N=2, L=4): 2 < 4. Correct.
    *   B < L (Ma=3, L=4): 3 < 4. Correct (Also satisfies L is right of B).
    *   M < D (M=1, D=2): 1 < 2. Correct.
13. **Update Known Information:**
    *   Pos: 1, 2, 3, 4
    *   Land: M, N, Ma, L
    *   Creature: ?, D, B, ? (D at 2 from Clue 6, B at 3 from B=Ma=3)
    *   Castle: ?, ?, St, ? (St at 3 from St=Ma=3)
    *   Wig: W < St (W < 3, so W is at 1 or 2).
14. **Analyze Clue 5:** ""The Troll (T) doesn't live at the Golden Castle (Go)"". ""The Golden Castle (Go) is to the left of where the Balrog stays (B)"" (Go < B). B is at position 3, so Go is at position 1 or 2. ""The Golden Castle (Go) is to the right of the Silver Castle (Si)"" (Si < Go). Combining these: Si < Go < B (pos 3). This means Si must be at position 1 and Go must be at position 2.
15. **Determine Castle Order:** Si=1, Go=2, St=3. The remaining castle, Glass (Gl), must be at position 4.
    *   Castle Order: Silver (Si), Gold (Go), Stone (St), Glass (Gl).
16. **Check Clue 5 consistency:** T ≠ Go (Go=2). Go < B (2 < 3). Si < Go (1 < 2). All correct.
17. **Analyze Clue 7:** ""The Troll (T) is not at the Silver Castle (Si)"" (T ≠ Si). Si is at position 1, so T ≠ 1. ""The Silver Castle (Si) is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig (W)"". Si is at position 1. For Si to be 1 position left of W, W must be at position 2.
18. **Confirm Wig Location:** W is at position 2. This is consistent with W < 3 (from step 13).
19. **Check Clue 7 consistency:** T ≠ Si (T ≠ 1). Si=1 is 1 left of W=2. Correct.
20. **Determine Creature Positions:**
    *   We know: D=2, B=3.
    *   From Clue 5 (T ≠ Go=2) and Clue 7 (T ≠ Si=1), T is not 1 or 2. B is 3. So T must be at position 4.
    *   The remaining creature is the Giant (G). G must be at position 1.
    *   Creature Order: Giant (G), Dragon (D), Balrog (B), Troll (T).
21. **Check Clue 3:** ""The Giant (G) is not at Lothlorien (L)"". G=1, L=4. (1 ≠ 4). Correct. ""Giant (G) is not in the same place as the wig (W)"". G=1, W=2. (1 ≠ 2). Correct.

22. **Final Configuration:**
    *   Position 1: Mordor (M), Silver Castle (Si), Giant (G)
    *   Position 2: Narnia (N), Gold Castle (Go), Dragon (D), Wig (W)
    *   Position 3: Malacandra (Ma), Stone Castle (St), Balrog (B)
    *   Position 4: Lothlorien (L), Glass Castle (Gl), Troll (T)

Summary of Answers:
*   Order of Fantasylands (1st to 4th): Mordor, Narnia, Malacandra, Lothlorien.
*   Castle in each land: Silver Castle in Mordor, Gold Castle in Narnia, Stone Castle in Malacandra, Glass Castle in Lothlorien.
*   Creature at each castle: Giant at Silver Castle, Dragon at Gold Castle, Balrog at Stone Castle, Troll at Glass Castle.
*   Location of Beethoven's Wig: The Wig is in the 2nd position, which is Narnia, inside the Gold Castle, guarded by the Dragon.

Final answer: The final answer is $\boxed{The order of the fantasylands is Mordor, Narnia, Malacandra, Lothlorien. The Silver Castle with the Giant is in Mordor. The Gold Castle with the Dragon is in Narnia. The Stone Castle with the Balrog is in Malacandra. The Glass Castle with the Troll is in Lothlorien.

235,"Just before the end of the term four high school students were discussing their chances for certain grades. The following remarks contain the gist of their hopes and fears.
Jack: We'll all get different grades. If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D.
Jean: If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D. Jack will get a better grade than Paul.
Lucy: If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C. If I get a B, then Paul won't get a D.
Paul: If Lucy gets an A, then I'll get a B. if Jean doesn't get a B, I won't either.
When the final examinations were graded and the term marks made out each of the four passed, and strange as it may seem, each received a grade that checked exactly with all the ideas they had previously expressed.
What grade did each receive?",Is it possible for Jack to get an A? Also note that Paul is below Jack,"Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul received B, A, D, and C, respectively.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let J, Je, L, P represent the grades received by Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul, respectively. The possible grades are A, B, C, D, where A is the highest and D is the lowest (A > B > C > D).
We are given that all four students passed and received different grades. Therefore, the set of grades {J, Je, L, P} is exactly {A, B, C, D}.

We need to find the specific assignment of grades such that all the statements made by the students are true. Let's list the statements as logical implications:

From Jack:
1. J1: The grades J, Je, L, P are all distinct. (This is given as true in the problem statement.)
2. J2: J = A => L = D

From Jean:
3. Je1: L = C => J = D
4. Je2: J > P (Jack's grade is better than Paul's grade)

From Lucy:
5. L1: Je ≠ A => J = C
6. L2: L = B => P ≠ D

From Paul:
7. P1: L = A => P = B
8. P2: Je ≠ B => P ≠ B

We can also use the contrapositive forms of these statements:
1. J2 Contrapositive: L ≠ D => J ≠ A
2. Je1 Contrapositive: J ≠ D => L ≠ C
3. Je2 implies J cannot be D (since it's the lowest) and P cannot be A (since it's the highest). So J ∈ {A, B, C} and P ∈ {B, C, D}.
4. L1 Contrapositive: J ≠ C => Je = A
5. L2 Contrapositive: P = D => L ≠ B
6. P1 Contrapositive: P ≠ B => L ≠ A
7. P2 Contrapositive: P = B => Je = B

Now, let's systematically determine the grades.

Step 1: Determine Jack's grade (J).
We know J ∈ {A, B, C}. Let's test each possibility.

Case 1: Assume J = A.
From J2 (J=A => L=D), we must have L=D.
From L1 (Je≠A => J=C), the conclusion J=C is false (since J=A). Therefore, the premise Je≠A must be false. This implies Je=A.
So, J=A and Je=A. This contradicts the condition J1 that all grades must be different.
Thus, J cannot be A. (J ≠ A)

Case 2: Assume J = C.
From Je2 (J > P), we have C > P. This means P must be D. (P=D)
Now we have J=C and P=D. The remaining grades for Jean (Je) and Lucy (L) are A and B. So {Je, L} = {A, B}.
Let's check P1 (L=A => P=B). We know P=D, so P≠B. For P1 to be true, the premise L=A must be false. Therefore, L≠A.
Since {Je, L} = {A, B} and L≠A, Lucy's grade must be B. (L=B)
Then Jean's grade must be the remaining one, which is A. (Je=A)
Let's check this potential assignment: {J=C, Je=A, L=B, P=D}.
We need to verify all the original statements:
Check L2 (L=B => P≠D): Here, L=B is true. The statement requires P≠D to be true. However, we have P=D. So P≠D is false. The implication L=B => P≠D becomes True => False, which is False.
This assignment does not satisfy all conditions.
Thus, J cannot be C. (J ≠ C)

Step 3: Determine Jack's grade.
We have shown J≠A, J≠C. We also know from Je2 (J>P) that J≠D.
The only remaining possibility for Jack's grade is B.
Therefore, J = B.

Step 4: Determine the other grades based on J = B.
From Je2 (J > P), we have B > P. This means P must be C or D. (P ∈ {C, D})
From L1's contrapositive (J≠C => Je=A): Since J=B, J≠C is true. Therefore, we must have Je=A. (Je = A)
Now we have J=B and Je=A. The remaining grades for Lucy (L) and Paul (P) are C and D. So {L, P} = {C, D}.
From Je1's contrapositive (J≠D => L≠C): Since J=B, J≠D is true. Therefore, we must have L≠C.
Since {L, P} = {C, D} and L≠C, Lucy's grade must be D. (L = D)
The only remaining grade for Paul is C. (P = C)

Step 5: Verify the solution.
The proposed assignment is {J=B, Je=A, L=D, P=C}.
Let's check if this assignment satisfies all the original statements:
1. J1: Grades B, A, D, C are all different. (True)
2. J2: J=A => L=D. J=B, so the premise is false. (Vacuously True)
3. Je1: L=C => J=D. L=D, so the premise is false. (Vacuously True)
4. Je2: J > P. B > C. (True)
5. L1: Je≠A => J=C. Je=A, so the premise is false. (Vacuously True)
6. L2: L=B => P≠D. L=D, so the premise is false. (Vacuously True)
7. P1: L=A => P=B. L=D, so the premise is false. (Vacuously True)
8. P2: Je≠B => P≠B. Je=A, so Je≠B is true. P=C, so P≠B is true. The implication is True => True. (True)

All statements are true for the assignment {J=B, Je=A, L=D, P=C}. This is the unique solution.

The grades are:
Jack: B
Jean: A
Lucy: D
Paul: C

Let the four standard arithmetic operations be ADD (addition), SUB (subtraction), MUL (multiplication), and DIV (division). The symbols +, -, *, / represent these four operations in some order, with each symbol representing a unique operation. The variables a, b, c are a permutation of the set {0, 1, 2}.

- If Op4 = ADD: a + a = b.
  - If a = 0, b = 0 + 0 = 0. This implies a = b, which is not allowed.
  - If a = 1, b = 1 + 1 = 2. This gives (a, b) = (1, 2). Since {a, b, c} = {0, 1, 2}, c must be 0. So, (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 0).
  - If a = 2, b = 2 + 2 = 4. This is not possible as b must be in {0, 1, 2}.
- If Op4 = SUB: a - a = b.
  - If a = 0, b = 0 - 0 = 0. a = b, not allowed.
  - If a = 1, b = 1 - 1 = 0. This gives (a, b) = (1, 0). c must be 2. So, (a, b, c) = (1, 0, 2).
  - If a = 2, b = 2 - 2 = 0. This gives (a, b) = (2, 0). c must be 1. So, (a, b, c) = (2, 0, 1).
- If Op4 = MUL: a * a = b.
  - If a = 0, b = 0 * 0 = 0. a = b, not allowed.
  - If a = 1, b = 1 * 1 = 1. a = b, not allowed.
  - If a = 2, b = 2 * 2 = 4. Not possible.
- If Op4 = DIV: a / a = b.
  - Division by zero (a=0) is undefined. So a cannot be 0.
  - If a = 1, b = 1 / 1 = 1. a = b, not allowed.
  - If a = 2, b = 2 / 2 = 1. This gives (a, b) = (2, 1). c must be 0. So, (a, b, c) = (2, 1, 0).

So, based on Equation 4, we have four possible cases for (a, b, c) and the operation Op4 (represented by the symbol *):
Case 1: (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 0) and Op4 = ADD. So '*' is ADD.
Case 2: (a, b, c) = (1, 0, 2) and Op4 = SUB. So '*' is SUB.
Case 3: (a, b, c) = (2, 0, 1) and Op4 = SUB. So '*' is SUB.
Case 4: (a, b, c) = (2, 1, 0) and Op4 = DIV. So '*' is DIV.

Let's analyze these cases one by one by checking the other equations.

Case 1: (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 0) and Op4 = ADD ('*' is ADD).
The set of remaining operations for Op1, Op2, Op3 ({+, -, /}) is {SUB, MUL, DIV}.
Eq 1: a Op1 c = a => 1 Op1 0 = 1.
  - If Op1 = SUB: 1 - 0 = 1. This works.
  - If Op1 = MUL: 1 * 0 = 0. Not 1.
  - If Op1 = DIV: 1 / 0 is undefined.
  So, Op1 must be SUB. The symbol '+' represents SUB.
Eq 2: b Op2 c = c => 2 Op2 0 = 0. The remaining operations for Op2, Op3 ({-, /}) are {MUL, DIV}.
  - If Op2 = MUL: 2 * 0 = 0. This works.
  - If Op2 = DIV: 2 / 0 is undefined.
  So, Op2 must be MUL. The symbol '-' represents MUL.
Eq 3: c Op3 b = c => 0 Op3 2 = 0. The remaining operation for Op3 ({/}) is DIV.
  - If Op3 = DIV: 0 / 2 = 0. This works.
  So, Op3 must be DIV. The symbol '/' represents DIV.
The assignments are: a=1, b=2, c=0. '+' is SUB, '-' is MUL, '/' is DIV, '*' is ADD.
These assignments satisfy all conditions: {a, b, c} = {0, 1, 2}, the operations are a permutation of {ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV}, and all four equations hold:
1. a + c = a => 1 SUB 0 = 1 - 0 = 1. Correct.
2. b - c = c => 2 MUL 0 = 2 * 0 = 0. Correct.
3. c / b = c => 0 DIV 2 = 0 / 2 = 0. Correct.
4. a * a = b => 1 ADD 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.
This is a valid solution.

Case 2: (a, b, c) = (1, 0, 2) and Op4 = SUB ('*' is SUB).
The set of remaining operations for Op1, Op2, Op3 ({+, -, /}) is {ADD, MUL, DIV}.
Eq 1: a Op1 c = a => 1 Op1 2 = 1.
  - If Op1 = ADD: 1 + 2 = 3. Not 1.
  - If Op1 = MUL: 1 * 2 = 2. Not 1.
  - If Op1 = DIV: 1 / 2 = 0.5. Not 1.
None of the possible operations for Op1 satisfy the equation. Thus, Case 2 is impossible.

Case 3: (a, b, c) = (2, 0, 1) and Op4 = SUB ('*' is SUB).
The set of remaining operations for Op1, Op2, Op3 ({+, -, /}) is {ADD, MUL, DIV}.
Eq 1: a Op1 c = a => 2 Op1 1 = 2.
  - If Op1 = ADD: 2 + 1 = 3. Not 2.
  - If Op1 = MUL: 2 * 1 = 2. This works. Op1 = MUL. '+' is MUL. Remaining operations for {-, /} are {ADD, DIV}.
  - If Op1 = DIV: 2 / 1 = 2. This works. Op1 = DIV. '+' is DIV. Remaining operations for {-, /} are {ADD, MUL}.
Let's examine these two subcases:
  Subcase 3a: Op1 = MUL ('+' is MUL). Remaining operations {ADD, DIV}.
  Eq 2: b Op2 c = c => 0 Op2 1 = 1. Op2 must be from {ADD, DIV}.
    - If Op2 = ADD: 0 + 1 = 1. This works. Op2 = ADD. '-' is ADD. Remaining operation for {/} is {DIV}.
    - If Op2 = DIV: 0 / 1 = 0. Not 1.
    So Op2 must be ADD. The symbol '-' is ADD. Op3 must be DIV ('/' is DIV).
    Eq 3: c Op3 b = c => 1 Op3 0 = 1. Here Op3 = DIV.
      - 1 DIV 0 = 1 / 0, which is undefined. Contradiction. Subcase 3a is impossible.
  Subcase 3b: Op1 = DIV ('+' is DIV). Remaining operations {ADD, MUL}.
  Eq 2: b Op2 c = c => 0 Op2 1 = 1. Op2 must be from {ADD, MUL}.
    - If Op2 = ADD: 0 + 1 = 1. This works. Op2 = ADD. '-' is ADD. Remaining operation for {/} is {MUL}.
    - If Op2 = MUL: 0 * 1 = 0. Not 1.
    So Op2 must be ADD. The symbol '-' is ADD. Op3 must be MUL ('/' is MUL).
    Eq 3: c Op3 b = c => 1 Op3 0 = 1. Here Op3 = MUL.
      - 1 MUL 0 = 1 * 0 = 0. Not 1. Contradiction. Subcase 3b is impossible.
Thus, Case 3 is impossible.

Case 4: (a, b, c) = (2, 1, 0) and Op4 = DIV ('*' is DIV).
The set of remaining operations for Op1, Op2, Op3 ({+, -, /}) is {ADD, SUB, MUL}.
Eq 1: a Op1 c = a => 2 Op1 0 = 2.
  - If Op1 = ADD: 2 + 0 = 2. This works. Op1 = ADD. '+' is ADD. Remaining operations for {-, /} are {SUB, MUL}.
  - If Op1 = SUB: 2 - 0 = 2. This works. Op1 = SUB. '+' is SUB. Remaining operations for {-, /} are {ADD, MUL}.
  - If Op1 = MUL: 2 * 0 = 0. Not 2.
Let's examine these two subcases:
  Subcase 4a: Op1 = ADD ('+' is ADD). Remaining operations {SUB, MUL}.
  Eq 2: b Op2 c = c => 1 Op2 0 = 0. Op2 must be from {SUB, MUL}.
    - If Op2 = SUB: 1 - 0 = 1. Not 0.
    - If Op2 = MUL: 1 * 0 = 0. This works. Op2 = MUL. '-' is MUL. Remaining operation for {/} is {SUB}.
    So Op2 must be MUL. The symbol '-' is MUL. Op3 must be SUB ('/' is SUB).
    Eq 3: c Op3 b = c => 0 Op3 1 = 0. Here Op3 = SUB.
      - 0 SUB 1 = 0 - 1 = -1. Not 0. Contradiction. Subcase 4a is impossible.
  Subcase 4b: Op1 = SUB ('+' is SUB). Remaining operations {ADD, MUL}.
  Eq 2: b Op2 c = c => 1 Op2 0 = 0. Op2 must be from {ADD, MUL}.
    - If Op2 = ADD: 1 + 0 = 1. Not 0.
    - If Op2 = MUL: 1 * 0 = 0. This works. Op2 = MUL. '-' is MUL. Remaining operation for {/} is {ADD}.
    So Op2 must be MUL. The symbol '-' is MUL. Op3 must be ADD ('/' is ADD).
    Eq 3: c Op3 b = c => 0 Op3 1 = 0. Here Op3 = ADD.
      - 0 ADD 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Not 0. Contradiction. Subcase 4b is impossible.
Thus, Case 4 is impossible.

The only case that yielded a consistent solution is Case 1.

Therefore, the values of a, b, c and the meanings of the symbols are:
a = 1
b = 2
c = 0

The symbol '+' represents subtraction (SUB).
The symbol '-' represents multiplication (MUL).
The symbol '/' represents division (DIV).
The symbol '*' represents addition (ADD).

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{a=1, b=2, c=0, \text{ '+' is subtraction, '-' is multiplication, '/' is division, '*' is addition}}$",True
239,"You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!","Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.","The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:
71-19-17-68",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let the safe combination be represented by four two-digit numbers: $S_1$-$S_2$-$S_3$-$S_4$.
Let $S_1 = 10a_1 + b_1$, $S_2 = 10a_2 + b_2$, $S_3 = 10a_3 + b_3$, $S_4 = 10a_4 + b_4$.

The problem states that these are two-digit numbers, so the first digit of each ($a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$) cannot be zero. Thus, $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}$. The second digits ($b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$) can be any digit from 0 to 9, initially.

Clue 2 states: There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
This means all digits $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3, a_4, b_4$ must belong to the set $D = \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
Since $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ cannot be 0, they must belong to the set $D' = \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
The digits $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$ must belong to the set $D = \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Clue 1 states: The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
$S_3$ is the reverse of $S_1$.
$S_1 = 10a_1 + b_1$. The reverse is $10b_1 + a_1$.
So, $S_3 = 10b_1 + a_1$.
This means $a_3 = b_1$ and $b_3 = a_1$.
Since $S_3$ is a two-digit number, its first digit $a_3$ cannot be 0. Therefore, $b_1 \neq 0$.
From Clue 2, $a_1 \in D' = \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ and $b_1 \in D = \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
Since $b_1 \neq 0$, $b_1$ must also be in $D' = \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
Also, $a_3 = b_1 \in D'$ and $b_3 = a_1 \in D'$. This is consistent with Clue 2.

Clue 3 states: If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
$4 \times S_3 = S_4$.
$S_4 = 10a_4 + b_4$. Since $S_4$ is a two-digit number, $S_4 \le 99$.
So, $4 \times S_3 \le 99$.
$S_3 \le \lfloor 99 / 4 \rfloor = 24$.
We know $S_3 = 10b_1 + a_1$, where $a_1, b_1 \in \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
If $b_1 \ge 6$, then $S_3 = 10b_1 + a_1 \ge 10(6) + 1 = 61$. This contradicts $S_3 \le 24$.
Therefore, $b_1$ must be 1.
With $b_1 = 1$, $S_3 = 10(1) + a_1 = 10 + a_1$. Since $a_1 \in \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$, the possible values for $S_3$ are:
$10+1=11$
$10+6=16$
$10+7=17$
$10+8=18$
$10+9=19$
All these values are indeed $\le 24$.
The digits in these possible $S_3$ values are {1}, {1, 6}, {1, 7}, {1, 8}, {1, 9}, all of which are in the allowed set $D$.

Now we calculate the corresponding $S_4 = 4 \times S_3$ for each case and check if the digits of $S_4$ are in the allowed set $D = \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
Case 1: $S_3 = 11$. $S_4 = 4 \times 11 = 44$. The digit 4 is not in $D$. Rule out.
Case 2: $S_3 = 16$. $S_4 = 4 \times 16 = 64$. The digit 4 is not in $D$. Rule out.
Case 3: $S_3 = 17$. $S_4 = 4 \times 17 = 68$. The digits 6 and 8 are in $D$. Possible.
   In this case, $b_1 = 1$ and $a_1 = 7$. So $S_1 = 10a_1 + b_1 = 10(7) + 1 = 71$.
   Check digits of $S_1$: {7, 1} are in $D$.
   Summary for Case 3: $S_1=71, S_3=17, S_4=68$. $a_1=7, b_1=1$. $a_3=1, b_3=7$. $a_4=6, b_4=8$.
Case 4: $S_3 = 18$. $S_4 = 4 \times 18 = 72$. The digit 2 is not in $D$. Rule out.
Case 5: $S_3 = 19$. $S_4 = 4 \times 19 = 76$. The digits 7 and 6 are in $D$. Possible.
   In this case, $b_1 = 1$ and $a_1 = 9$. So $S_1 = 10a_1 + b_1 = 10(9) + 1 = 91$.
   Check digits of $S_1$: {9, 1} are in $D$.
   Summary for Case 5: $S_1=91, S_3=19, S_4=76$. $a_1=9, b_1=1$. $a_3=1, b_3=9$. $a_4=7, b_4=6$.

We are left with two possibilities: (Case 3: $S_1=71, S_3=17, S_4=68$) or (Case 5: $S_1=91, S_3=19, S_4=76$).

Clue 4 states: If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
""first number in the first set"" is the digit $a_1$.
""first number in the second set"" is the digit $a_2$.
So, $a_1 + a_2 = 8$.
We know $a_1 \in D' = \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ and $a_2 \in D' = \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

Let's check this condition for the two remaining cases:
Case 3: $a_1 = 7$. The equation becomes $7 + a_2 = 8$, which gives $a_2 = 1$.
   Is $a_2=1$ in the allowed set $D' = \{1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$? Yes. So Case 3 is still possible.
Case 5: $a_1 = 9$. The equation becomes $9 + a_2 = 8$, which gives $a_2 = -1$.
   This is not a digit, so Case 5 is impossible. Rule out.

Therefore, the only possibility is Case 3. We have:
$S_1 = 71$ ($a_1=7, b_1=1$)
$S_3 = 17$ ($a_3=1, b_3=7$)
$S_4 = 68$ ($a_4=6, b_4=8$)
And we found $a_2 = 1$.

Now we need to find $S_2 = 10a_2 + b_2$. Since $a_2=1$, $S_2 = 10(1) + b_2 = 10 + b_2$.
From Clue 2, the digit $b_2$ must be in $D = \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
So, possible values for $S_2$ are $10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19$.

Clue 5 states: The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
$S_2 \le 20$.
All the possible values for $S_2$ ($10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19$) satisfy this condition. This clue does not eliminate any possibilities for $b_2$.

Clue 6 states: The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
""second number in the second set"" is the digit $b_2$.
""second number in the fourth set"" is the digit $b_4$.
""one higher than the numbers in the first set"" is $S_1 + 1$.
So, the equation is $b_2 \times b_4 = S_1 + 1$.

From our results for Case 3, we have $S_1 = 71$ and $b_4 = 8$.
Substituting these values into the equation:
$b_2 \times 8 = 71 + 1$
$b_2 \times 8 = 72$
Solving for $b_2$: $b_2 = 72 / 8 = 9$.

We must check if this value $b_2 = 9$ is allowed.
From Clue 2, $b_2$ must be in $D = \{0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. Yes, 9 is in this set.
Now we can determine $S_2$. $a_2=1$ and $b_2=9$.
$S_2 = 10a_2 + b_2 = 10(1) + 9 = 19$.

Let's quickly re-check $S_2=19$ against Clue 5: $S_2 \le 20$. Yes, $19 \le 20$.

So, the four sets of numbers are:
$S_1 = 71$
$S_2 = 19$
$S_3 = 17$
$S_4 = 68$

The combination is 71-19-17-68.

Let's perform a final verification using all clues and conditions:
1.  $S_1=71, S_2=19, S_3=17, S_4=68$. All are two-digit numbers. $a_1=7, a_2=1, a_3=1, a_4=6$. No leading zeros.
2.  Clue 1: $S_3=17$ is the reverse of $S_1=71$. Verified.
3.  Clue 2: Digits used are {7, 1, 1, 9, 1, 7, 6, 8}. All are in {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Verified.
4.  Clue 3: $4 \times S_3 = 4 \times 17 = 68 = S_4$. Verified.
5.  Clue 4: $a_1 + a_2 = 7 + 1 = 8$. Verified.
6.  Clue 5: $S_2 = 19$, which is not greater than 20. Verified.
7.  Clue 6: $b_2 \times b_4 = 9 \times 8 = 72$. $S_1 + 1 = 71 + 1 = 72$. They are equal. Verified.

The solution is consistent with all clues and conditions.

241,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?","In baseball, the home team bats last.  ","Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"1.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series, meaning the first team to win four games is the champion.
2.  The problem provides the final scores for seven distinct games. This implies that the series lasted the maximum possible duration of seven games.
3.  For a best-of-seven series to go to seven games, neither team can have won four games prior to the seventh game. This means that after six games, the series must have been tied, with each team having won exactly three games.
4.  The winner of the World Series is therefore the team that won the seventh game.
5.  We need to determine which team won Game 7.
6.  The problem states the hosting schedule: Los Angeles Dodgers (LAD) hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7. New York Yankees (NYY) hosted Games 3, 4, and 5.
7.  Therefore, for Game 7, the Los Angeles Dodgers were the home team, and the New York Yankees were the visiting team.
8.  The final score of Game 7 was 13 to 8, and the game lasted 13 innings.
9.  We must consider the rules of baseball regarding extra innings to determine the winner based on the score and the home/visiting team status.
10. In baseball, the visiting team bats in the top half of each inning, and the home team bats in the bottom half.
11. If a game is tied after 9 innings, it goes into extra innings. Play continues inning by inning.
12. If the visiting team scores in the top of an extra inning, the home team still gets its turn to bat in the bottom of that inning. The game continues if the home team ties the score.
13. If the home team is tied or trailing entering the bottom of the 9th inning or any subsequent extra inning, and the home team scores runs to take the lead, the game ends *immediately* upon the scoring of the run that gives the home team the lead (this is known as a ""walk-off"" win).
14. Let's analyze the possibilities for the Game 7 outcome (Score 13-8, 13 innings, LAD home team):
    *   **Scenario 1: LAD (home team) won Game 7.** For LAD to win, they must have scored the winning run in the bottom of the 13th inning. Due to the walk-off rule, the game would end immediately when LAD took the lead. The only way for the home team to win by more than one run is if the game-ending play results in multiple runs scoring (e.g., a home run). The maximum number of runs that can be scored on a single conventional play like a home run is 4 (a grand slam).
        *   If the score was tied 8-8 entering the bottom of the 13th, a walk-off grand slam would result in a final score of LAD 12, NYY 8.
        *   If LAD was trailing, say 8-5, entering the bottom of the 13th, a walk-off grand slam would result in a final score of LAD 9, NYY 8.
        *   In no standard walk-off scenario can the home team win with a final score of 13-8 (a 5-run margin achieved in the bottom of the final inning). Such an outcome is virtually impossible under standard baseball rules.
    *   **Scenario 2: NYY (visiting team) won Game 7.** For NYY to win, they must have held the lead after the full 13th inning was completed. A plausible way this could happen is if the score was tied 8-8 entering the 13th inning. NYY could have scored 5 runs in the top of the 13th inning to take a 13-8 lead. Then, LAD would have batted in the bottom of the 13th inning and failed to score, resulting in a final score of NYY 13, LAD 8. This scenario is entirely consistent with the rules and common occurrences in baseball.
15. Based on the analysis of the Game 7 score, inning count, and home team status, the only logical and plausible conclusion is that the visiting team, the New York Yankees, won Game 7.
16. Since the series went 7 games, the winner of Game 7 is the winner of the World Series.
17. Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{New York Yankees}$",True
242,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",Set up an equation.,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let $N=86$ be the total number of people in the tourist group.
The group split into two groups. Let the number of people in the two groups be $n_1$ and $n_2$.
We have $n_1 + n_2 = 86$.
One group is smaller than the other. Let $n_1$ be the size of the smaller group and $n_2$ be the size of the larger group.
So $n_1 < n_2$.
Since $n_1 + n_2 = 86$, this implies $n_1 < 86/2 = 43$. So $n_1 \le 42$.
Also, $n_2 = 86 - n_1 > 43$. So $n_2 \ge 44$.
The smaller group ($n_1$ people) went to the beach, and the bigger group ($n_2$ people) went to see a water mill.

We analyze the given statements:
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
This means either $n_1/4 > n_2$ or $n_2/4 > n_1$.
Since $n_1 < n_2$, $n_1/4 < n_2/4$. Also $n_1/4 < n_1$ is only possible if $n_1$ is negative, which is not possible. $n_1/4 < n_2$ is always true since $n_1 < n_2$.
The condition $n_1/4 > n_2$ would imply $n_1 > 4n_2$. Since $n_1 < n_2$, this is impossible.
So the only possibility is $n_2/4 > n_1$.
Substitute $n_2 = 86 - n_1$:
$(86 - n_1)/4 > n_1$
$86 - n_1 > 4n_1$
$86 > 5n_1$
$n_1 < 86/5 = 17.2$
Since $n_1$ must be an integer, $n_1 \le 17$.
This also implies $n_2 = 86 - n_1 \ge 86 - 17 = 69$.
So statement (a) tells us $1 \le n_1 \le 17$ and $69 \le n_2 \le 85$.

b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
Let the size of this group be $n$. Let $w$ be the number of women and $m$ be the number of men in this group.
$n = w + m$. We are given $w = 6m$.
So $n = 6m + m = 7m$.
This means that the size of this group must be a multiple of 7.
So either $n_1$ is a multiple of 7 or $n_2$ is a multiple of 7.
Possible values for $n_1$ (multiples of 7 in $[1, 17]$): 7, 14.
Possible values for $n_2$ (multiples of 7 in $[69, 85]$): 70, 77, 84.
We check the pairs $(n_1, n_2)$ such that $n_1+n_2=86$:
Case 1: $n_1$ is a multiple of 7.
If $n_1 = 7$, then $n_2 = 86 - 7 = 79$. $n_2$ is not a multiple of 7. So in this case, the smaller group ($n_1=7$) satisfies condition (b). This pair is $(7, 79)$. Let's check condition (a): $n_2/4 = 79/4 = 19.75 > n_1=7$. This pair is possible so far.
If $n_1 = 14$, then $n_2 = 86 - 14 = 72$. $n_2$ is not a multiple of 7. So in this case, the smaller group ($n_1=14$) satisfies condition (b). This pair is $(14, 72)$. Let's check condition (a): $n_2/4 = 72/4 = 18 > n_1=14$. This pair is possible so far.
Case 2: $n_2$ is a multiple of 7.
If $n_2 = 70$, then $n_1 = 86 - 70 = 16$. $n_1$ is not a multiple of 7. So in this case, the larger group ($n_2=70$) satisfies condition (b). This pair is $(16, 70)$. Let's check condition (a): $n_2/4 = 70/4 = 17.5 > n_1=16$. This pair is possible so far.
If $n_2 = 77$, then $n_1 = 86 - 77 = 9$. $n_1$ is not a multiple of 7. So in this case, the larger group ($n_2=77$) satisfies condition (b). This pair is $(9, 77)$. Let's check condition (a): $n_2/4 = 77/4 = 19.25 > n_1=9$. This pair is possible so far.
If $n_2 = 84$, then $n_1 = 86 - 84 = 2$. $n_1$ is not a multiple of 7. So in this case, the larger group ($n_2=84$) satisfies condition (b). This pair is $(2, 84)$. Let's check condition (a): $n_2/4 = 84/4 = 21 > n_1=2$. This pair is possible so far.
So based on (a) and (b), the possible pairs $(n_1, n_2)$ are $(7, 79)$, $(14, 72)$, $(16, 70)$, $(9, 77)$, $(2, 84)$.

c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
The number of people in such a group must be even (each person has a spouse in the group, so number of men equals number of women, total $m+w = 2m$).
Let's examine the possible pairs:
- $(7, 79)$: Neither 7 nor 79 is even. This pair is impossible.
- $(14, 72)$: Both 14 and 72 are even. This pair is possible. For this pair, $n_1=14$ is the group satisfying (b). It has $m=2$ men and $w=12$ women. Since $m \neq w$, $n_1$ cannot be the group with only married couples. Thus, $n_2=72$ must be the group with only married couples. This is consistent as 72 is even.
- $(16, 70)$: Both 16 and 70 are even. This pair is possible. For this pair, $n_2=70$ is the group satisfying (b). It has $m=10$ men and $w=60$ women. Since $m \neq w$, $n_2$ cannot be the group with only married couples. Thus, $n_1=16$ must be the group with only married couples. This is consistent as 16 is even.
- $(9, 77)$: Neither 9 nor 77 is even. This pair is impossible.
- $(2, 84)$: Both 2 and 84 are even. This pair is possible. For this pair, $n_2=84$ is the group satisfying (b). It has $m=12$ men and $w=72$ women. Since $m \neq w$, $n_2$ cannot be the group with only married couples. Thus, $n_1=2$ must be the group with only married couples. This is consistent as 2 is even.
So the possible pairs are now reduced to $(14, 72)$, $(16, 70)$, and $(2, 84)$.

d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
Let's check the remaining pairs:
- $(14, 72)$: 14 is not divisible by 4. 72 is divisible by 4 ($72 = 4 \times 18$). This pair is possible.
- $(16, 70)$: 16 is divisible by 4 ($16 = 4 \times 4$). 70 is not divisible by 4 ($70 = 4 \times 17 + 2$). This pair is possible.
- $(2, 84)$: 2 is not divisible by 4. 84 is divisible by 4 ($84 = 4 \times 21$). This pair is possible.
Statement (d) does not eliminate any of the remaining three pairs.

e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.
Let the size of this group be $n$. Let $y$ be the number of people younger than 50 and $o$ be the number of people at least 50 years old.
$n = y + o$. We are given $y = 8o$.
So $n = 8o + o = 9o$.
This means that the size of this group must be a multiple of 9.
Let's check the remaining pairs:
- $(14, 72)$: 14 is not a multiple of 9. 72 is a multiple of 9 ($72 = 9 \times 8$). So $n_2=72$ must be the group satisfying statement (e). This pair is possible. In this group, $o=8$ people are at least 50 years old, and $y=8 \times 8 = 64$ people are younger than 50.
- $(16, 70)$: 16 is not a multiple of 9. 70 is not a multiple of 9 ($70 = 9 \times 7 + 7$). This pair is impossible.
- $(2, 84)$: 2 is not a multiple of 9. 84 is not a multiple of 9 ($84 = 9 \times 9 + 3$). This pair is impossible.

The only remaining possible pair is $(14, 72)$.
We verify this solution by checking all statements:
$n_1=14$, $n_2=72$. $n_1+n_2 = 14+72=86$. $n_1<n_2$. Smaller group has 14 people, larger group has 72 people.
a) $n_2/4 = 72/4 = 18$. $18 > n_1=14$. True.
b) One group's size is a multiple of 7. $14 = 7 \times 2$. 72 is not a multiple of 7. So $n_1=14$ is the group. It has 2 men and 12 women ($12 = 6 \times 2$). True.
c) One group contains only married couples. $n_1=14$ has 2 men, 12 women, so it cannot be this group. $n_2=72$ is an even number, so it can be this group (36 couples). True.
d) One group size is divisible by 4. $14$ is not divisible by 4. $72 = 4 \times 18$. True.
e) One group size is a multiple of 9. $14$ is not a multiple of 9. $72 = 9 \times 8$. So $n_2=72$ is the group. It has 8 people >= 50 years old and 64 people < 50 years old ($64 = 8 \times 8$). True.

All statements are satisfied for the group sizes 14 and 72.
The smaller group (beach) has 14 people.
The larger group (water mill) has 72 people.

The question asks for the number of people in each group.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{14 \text{ and } 72}$",True

245,"The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.
What was the question?",,Do you mind?,GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Here's a step-by-step deduction to find the question:

1.  **Analyze the riddle statement:** ""The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no."" This statement describes a situation where a speaker responds with the word ""yes"" to a question, but their intended message or implication is ""no"".

2.  **Identify the core requirement:** We need to find a question (let's call it $Q$) such that if someone answers ""yes"" to $Q$, the meaning they intend to convey is ""no"".

3.  **Consider different types of questions:**
    *   **Questions about the speaker's state where answering contradicts the state:**
        *   Example: ""Are you asleep?"" If the speaker answers ""yes"", the very act of answering proves they are not asleep. So, the answer ""yes"" means ""no, I am not asleep"". This fits the criteria.
        *   Example: ""Are you mute?"" Answering ""yes"" proves they are not mute. The answer ""yes"" means ""no, I am not mute"". This also fits.
    *   **Questions involving logical self-reference or contradiction:**
        *   Example: ""Is it true that you mean no?"" If the speaker answers ""yes"", they are affirming the content of the question, meaning ""It is true that I mean no."" Thus, the answer ""yes"" directly conveys the meaning ""no"". This fits perfectly.
        *   Example: ""Do you always answer 'no'?"" If the speaker answers ""yes"", this answer contradicts the claim that they always answer ""no"". The meaning conveyed is ""no, I don't always answer 'no'"". This fits.
        *   Example: ""Are you saying 'no'?"" If the speaker answers ""yes"", they said ""yes"", not ""no"". The act of answering contradicts the content. The meaning is ""no, I am not saying 'no' (I am saying 'yes')"". This fits.
    *   **Questions involving linguistic pragmatics and social conventions:**
        *   Example: ""Do you mind if I [do something]?"" (e.g., ""Do you mind if I open the window?"") In standard English usage, answering ""yes"" to this question means ""Yes, I do mind."" The implication is that the speaker objects to the action, thereby conveying a negative response to the implicit request (""May I open the window?""). So, the answer ""yes"" (I mind) effectively means ""no"" (don't do it). This fits the criteria.

4.  **Evaluate the candidates:** All the types of questions listed above provide valid scenarios where answering ""yes"" means ""no"". However, riddles often play on common language usage, ambiguities, or social conventions that can lead to misunderstandings. The ""Do you mind if...?"" type of question is a classic example of this in natural language.
    *   The literal answer to ""Do you mind...?"" is about whether the speaker minds (Yes/No).
    *   The intended meaning relates to permission for the action (Yes, go ahead / No, don't do it).
    *   Answering ""Yes"" literally means ""Yes, I mind"".
    *   This conventionally implies ""No, you should not do it"".
    *   This scenario perfectly matches the riddle: The answer given is ""yes"", but the meaning conveyed regarding the action is ""no"".

5.  **Select the most fitting answer:** While several questions logically fit the structure, the question ""Do you mind if...?"" is a strong candidate because it represents a common real-world linguistic situation where ""yes"" functions pragmatically as ""no"". It relies on understanding language use in context, which is characteristic of many riddles. Questions like ""Are you asleep?"" or ""Is it true that you mean no?"" are also correct interpretations but are arguably less common scenarios or more purely logical constructions. The ""Do you mind...?"" structure feels most aligned with the style of a traditional riddle.

6.  **Formulate the final answer:** The question must be one where answering ""yes"" means ""no"". A question fitting this description is ""Do you mind if I... ?"" or a specific instance of it.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Do you mind?}$",True

247,"You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Here is a step-by-step derivation of the sequence of keys:

Let the sequence of 9 digits be $S = (d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9)$.

From Condition 1, the set of digits $\{d_1, ..., d_9\}$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. The sum of these digits is $1 + 2 + ... + 9 = \frac{9 \times 10}{2} = 45$.

From Condition 5, the sum of the first 5 digits is $S_1 = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 = 19$.
From Condition 6, the sum of the last 5 digits is $S_2 = d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 27$.

We can find the value of $d_5$ by adding $S_1$ and $S_2$:
$S_1 + S_2 = (d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5) + (d_5 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9) = 19 + 27 = 46$.
The sum $S_1 + S_2$ includes all 9 digits plus an extra $d_5$.
So, $S_1 + S_2 = (d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_9) + d_5 = 45 + d_5$.
Therefore, $45 + d_5 = 46$, which implies $d_5 = 1$.

Now we can refine the sum conditions:
$d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + 1 = 19 \implies d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 18$.
$1 + d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 27 \implies d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 26$.

From Condition 3, $\{d_2, d_4\} = \{2, 4\}$. There are two possibilities:
Case A: $d_2 = 2, d_4 = 4$.
Case B: $d_2 = 4, d_4 = 2$.

From Condition 4, $\{d_6, d_8\} = \{6, 8\}$. There are two possibilities:
Case 1: $d_6 = 6, d_8 = 8$.
Case 2: $d_6 = 8, d_8 = 6$.

Let's use Condition 2 (no two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively), which means $|d_i - d_{i+1}| \neq 1$ for all $i=1, ..., 8$.
Consider the constraint $|d_4 - d_5| \neq 1$. Since $d_5 = 1$, we have $|d_4 - 1| \neq 1$. This means $d_4 \neq 0$ (which is true) and $d_4 \neq 2$.
The condition $d_4 \neq 2$ eliminates Case B for the pair $\{d_2, d_4\}$.
Thus, we must have Case A: $d_2 = 2$ and $d_4 = 4$.

Now we update the sequence: $S = (d_1, 2, d_3, 4, 1, d_6, d_7, d_8, d_9)$.
Substitute $d_2=2$ and $d_4=4$ into the sum $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 18$:
$d_1 + 2 + d_3 + 4 = 18 \implies d_1 + d_3 = 12$.

Substitute the known values for $d_6, d_8$ into the sum $d_6 + d_7 + d_8 + d_9 = 26$.
If $d_6=6, d_8=8$: $6 + d_7 + 8 + d_9 = 26 \implies d_7 + d_9 = 12$.
If $d_6=8, d_8=6$: $8 + d_7 + 6 + d_9 = 26 \implies d_7 + d_9 = 12$.
In both cases for $d_6, d_8$, we have $d_7 + d_9 = ",True

Since A and H agree with each other while E and F are against them, exactly two of these four must be true.
Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.",GeminiPro,mathPrompt,"Let $P_1$ denote the person who got first place. The set of possible winners is $S = \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\}$.
Let $S_X$ denote the statement made by person X. Let $T(S_X)$ be the truth value of the statement $S_X$, where $T(S_X)=1$ if the statement is true and $T(S_X)=0$ if it is false.
We are given that exactly three statements are true, so $\sum_{X \in S} T(S_X) = 3$.

The statements are:
$S_A$: $P_1 = F \lor P_1 = H$.
$S_B$: $P_1 = B$.
$S_C$: $P_1 = G$.
$S_D$: $P_1 \neq B$.
$S_E$: $\neg S_A$, which is $P_1 \neq F \land P_1 \neq H$.
$S_F$: $P_1 \neq F \land P_1 \neq H$.
$S_G$: $P_1 \neq C$.
$S_H$: $S_A$, which is $P_1 = F \lor P_1 = H$.

We can observe several relationships between the statements:
1.  $S_A$ and $S_H$ are identical statements. Therefore, their truth values must be the same: $T(S_A) = T(S_H)$.
2.  $S_E$ and $S_F$ are identical statements. Therefore, their truth values must be the same: $T(S_E) = T(S_F)$.
3.  $S_E$ is the negation of $S_A$. $S_E \equiv \neg S_A$. This means that exactly one of $S_A$ and $S_E$ must be true. So, $T(S_A) + T(S_E) = 1$.
4.  From (1), (2), and (3), it follows that $S_F$ is also the negation of $S_H$ ($S_F \equiv S_E \equiv \neg S_A \equiv \neg S_H$). Thus, $T(S_H) + T(S_F) = 1$. This is consistent with $T(S_A) + T(S_E) = 1$.
5.  $S_D$ is the negation of $S_B$. $S_D \equiv \neg S_B$. This means that exactly one of $S_B$ and $S_D$ must be true. So, $T(S_B) + T(S_D) = 1$.

We are given that the total number of true statements is 3:
$\sum_{X \in S} T(S_X) = T(S_A) + T(S_B) + T(S_C) + T(S_D) + T(S_E) + T(S_F) + T(S_G) + T(S_H) = 3$.

We can regroup the terms using the identified pairs of statements:
$(T(S_A) + T(S_E)) + (T(S_H) + T(S_F)) + (T(S_B) + T(S_D)) + T(S_C) + T(S_G) = 3$.

Substitute the known sums for the contradictory pairs:
$1 + (T(S_H) + T(S_F)) + (T(S_B) + T(S_D)) + T(S_C) + T(S_G) = 3$.
Since $T(S_H) + T(S_F) = 1$ and $T(S_B) + T(S_D) = 1$, we have:
$1 + 1 + 1 + T(S_C) + T(S_G) = 3$.
$3 + T(S_C) + T(S_G) = 3$.

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:
$T(S_C) + T(S_G) = 0$.

Since truth values can only be 0 or 1, the only way their sum can be 0 is if both truth values are 0.
Therefore, $T(S_C) = 0$ and $T(S_G) = 0$.

$T(S_C) = 0$ means that statement $S_C$ is false. $S_C$ is ""G is first"". If this is false, then $P_1 \neq G$.
$T(S_G) = 0$ means that statement $S_G$ is false. $S_G$ is ""C is not first"". If this is false, then the negation must be true. The negation of ""C is not first"" is ""C is first"". So, $P_1 = C$.

We have deduced that C got first place. Let's verify this result.
If $P_1 = C$, we evaluate the truth values of all statements:
$S_A$: $C=F \lor C=H$. False, assuming C, F, H are distinct people. $T(S_A) = 0$.
$S_B$: $C=B$. False. $T(S_B) = 0$.
$S_C$: $C=G$. False. $T(S_C) = 0$.
$S_D$: $C \neq B$. True. $T(S_D) = 1$.
$S_E$: $C \neq F \land C \neq H$. True. $T(S_E) = 1$.
$S_F$: $C \neq F \land C \neq H$. True. $T(S_F) = 1$.
$S_G$: $C \neq C$. False. $T(S_G) = 0$.
$S_H$: $C=F \lor C=H$. False. $T(S_H) = 0$.

The true statements are $S_D$, $S_E$, and $S_F$. The number of true statements is $0+0+0+1+1+1+0+0 = 3$.
This matches the condition given by the teacher that exactly three statements are true.
Our conclusion that C got first place is correct and consistent with all the information provided.
The logical deduction is fully justified and does not involve brute force.
