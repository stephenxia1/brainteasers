Colours now known: 1=?, 2 = blue, 3=?, 4 = green, 5 = white.  \n   The only unused colours are red and yellow.\n\n6.  Clue 1: the Brit lives in the red house \u21d2 House 3 is red and its owner is the Brit.  \n   \u21d2 The remaining unused colour, yellow, must be House 1.  \n\n7.  Clue 7: the yellow-house owner smokes Dunhill \u21d2 House 1 smokes Dunhill.\n\n8.  Clue 11: the horse is kept next to the Dunhill smoker \u21d2 the horse is in House 2.\n\n9.  Because House 1 is yellow, 2 blue, 3 red, 4 green, 5 white \u2014 colours are fixed.\n\n10.  We have left to assign drinks: water, tea, beer (milk and coffee already fixed).  \n    Cigars left: Blends, Pall Mall, Bluemasters, Prince (Dunhill fixed).  \n    Pets left: cats, birds, dogs, fish (horse already fixed).\n\n11.  Consider where the Blends smoker can be (clues 10 & 15):  \n    \u2013 If Blends were in 1 or 5 it would have only one neighbour, who would have to have both cats and water, which is impossible for 5 (coffee) and for 1 (Dunhill already fixes neighbour\u2019s horse).  \n    \u21d2 Blends must be in 2, 3, or 4.\n\n12.  Put Blends in House 2 (try).  \n    \u2022 Then, by clue 15, water must be in a neighbour. House 3 drinks milk, so water must be in House 1.  \n    \u2022 By clue 10 cats must be next to Blends; house 1 is already a neighbour, so let cats be in House 1 too.  \n    (This satisfies both clues simultaneously.)\n\n13.  House 1 now: Norwegian \u2013 yellow \u2013 water \u2013 Dunhill \u2013 cats. All consistent.\n\n14.  Drinks left unassigned: tea (for the Dane) and beer.  \n    Bluemasters/beer cannot be in House 2 (already Blends) \u21d2 Bluemasters will be somewhere else.\n\n15.  House 2 still needs a drink; milk & coffee taken, water in 1, so tea fits \u21d2 House 2 is the Dane and drinks tea (clue 3).\n\n16.  Bluemasters must therefore be in the only house still free for both cigar and drink pairing: House 5.  \n    \u21d2 House 5 smokes Bluemasters and drinks beer (clue 12).\n\n17.  Cigars left to place in Houses 3 and 4 are Pall Mall and Prince.  \n    \u2022 If House 3 smoked Prince, its owner would have to be German (clue 13) but House 3 is already the Brit, impossible.  \n    \u21d2 House 3 smokes Pall Mall and keeps birds (clue 6).  \n    \u21d2 House 4 smokes Prince and is the German (clue 13).\n\n18.  Only one nationality left, the Swede, must be House 5.  \n    Clue 2: the Swede keeps dogs \u21d2 House 5\u2019s pet is dogs.\n\n19.  Pets now: 1 = cats, 2 = horse, 3 = birds, 5 = dogs. The only pet unassigned is fish, so the remaining house (House 4) keeps the fish.\n\n20.  Summary of each house\n\n   House 1: Norwegian \u2013 yellow \u2013 water \u2013 Dunhill \u2013 cats  \n   House 2: Dane \u2013 blue \u2013 tea \u2013 Blends \u2013 horse  \n   House 3: Brit \u2013 red \u2013 milk \u2013 Pall Mall \u2013 birds  \n   House 4: German \u2013 green \u2013 coffee \u2013 Prince \u2013 fish  \n   House 5: Swede \u2013 white \u2013 beer \u2013 Bluemasters \u2013 dogs\n\nAll 15 clues are satisfied.\n\nFinal answer: The German owns the fish.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 404, "completion_tokens": 4562, "total_tokens": 4966, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3456, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Which horses might still be 2-nd or 3-rd overall?\n\n   \u2022 From A we must still consider A2 and A3 (the two that have lost only to A1).  \n   \u2022 From B we must consider B1 and B2 (B1 lost only to A1, B2 lost only to A1 and B1).  \n   \u2022 From C we must consider C1 (lost only to A1 and B1).  \n\n   These are exactly five horses:         A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , C1.\n\n4.

Company B really did need a million dollars to make a profit on such a dangerous job, so at first he truthfully told the Emperor that he \u201ccould not do it for less than $1 000 000\u201d.  \n\n2.  He realised, however, that the Emperor hesitated because another firm had quoted only $800 000.  \n   The Emperor wanted the bridge but he also wanted to feel safe from being over-charged.\n\n3.  So B framed the price in a different way.  \n   He said: \u201cI\u2019ll build the whole bridge exactly to the specifications you gave both firms.  \n   When I am finished you \u2013 and you alone \u2013 may decide what the work was worth and pay me\n\n        \u2022 $200 000 if you think the work is poor,  \n        \u2022 $750 000 if you think it is merely acceptable, or  \n        \u2022 $1 000 000 if you think it is excellent.\u201d\n\n   In other words all the risk lay on B\u2019s shoulders and all the power of decision lay with the Emperor.  \n   From the Emperor\u2019s point of view that was an \u201coffer he could not refuse\u201d: he could always pay less\n   than Company A\u2019s $800 000 if he felt disappointed.\n\n4.  Contractor B then built an outstanding bridge \u2013 on time, on budget, beautifully finished and strong\n    enough for heavy vehicles.  \n\n5.  At the end the Emperor had to choose a payment.  \n    \u2013 Paying only $200 000 would have been blatantly unfair.  \n    \u2013 Paying $750 000 would still have meant under-paying a man who had taken a big risk and had succeeded brilliantly, and it would have broadcast to every other potential investor that the ruler of the islands\n      was willing to short-change honest contractors.  \n    \u2013 Paying the full $1 000 000 was the only honest choice and the best advertisement for the islands\u2019 new, fair-dealing image.\n\n6.  Because the Emperor was a fair and forward-looking ruler, he paid the million dollars.  \n    Contractor B had neither lied nor cheated; he had simply relied on the Emperor\u2019s integrity and on the\n    value the Emperor put on his own reputation.\n\nThus the offer sounded irresistible because the Emperor seemed to hold all the cards, and Company B ended up with the highest amount because the Emperor, after seeing the finished product and thinking about his reputation, voluntarily chose to pay the full $1 000 000.\n\nFinal answer: Company B let the Emperor choose the payment after the bridge was finished ($200 000 if poor, $750 000 if merely adequate, $1 000 000 if excellent).

The only possible unordered pairs of distinct digits satisfying this (and not using the already-placed 0) are {1,3} (sum 4) and {7,9} (sum 16).\n\n4. d\u2089 + d\u2081\u2080 must be a cube (0,1 or 8).

The flower\u2019s best-response rule\nGiven any positive probability q that the dog might eat,\n  \u2013 Expected survival if F does NOT poison: 1\u2013q  \n  \u2013 Expected survival if F DOES poison: 1\u2013c  \nHence F prefers to poison whenever q>c.  Because c is merely \u201csome effort\u201d, F will poison\nas soon as it is not absolutely certain (q=0) that the dog will refrain from eating.\n\nC.  Can the flower be absolutely certain that the dog will not eat?\nNo.  There is no communication, no visible commitment, no physical impossibility that\nprevents the dog from choosing Eat.  All F can do is reason about D\u2019s rationality, but\npure reasoning cannot give a probability q=0; \u201cthe dog must not want to eat\u201d is not a\nlogical necessity, merely a strategic consideration.  Hence from F\u2019s point of view\nq>0, so F\u2019s rational move is to produce poison.\n\nD.  The dog\u2019s best response to that knowledge\nThe dog knows every item above, in particular:\n  \u2013 It knows the flower will reason exactly as in B and therefore will in fact poison.\nTherefore the dog evaluates its options:\n  \u2022 Eat \u2192 death with certainty (pay-off 0).  \n  \u2022 Do not eat \u2192 survival probability \u00bd (pay-off 0.5).  \nSince 0.5 > 0, a rational dog chooses \u00acEat.\n\nE.  Consistency (equilibrium check)\nGiven D\u2019s choice \u00acEat, F is still happy with its decision to poison: producing the\npoison costs c but guarantees survival (1\u2013c), while skipping the poison would expose\nit to the still-positive risk that D might deviate and eat (yield 1\u2013q with q>0).  Hence\npoisoning remains its best move.  The strategy pair\n\u2003\u2003(F: P,\u2003D: \u00acEat)\nis therefore a Nash equilibrium.\n\nConclusion\nBecause the flower will rationally manufacture poison (to eliminate even the slightest\nchance of being eaten), the dog realises that eating would be fatal and therefore opts\nnot to eat.\n\nFinal answer: the dog will not eat the flower.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 899, "completion_tokens": 2944, "total_tokens": 3843, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2240, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Inside the B-branch we still need a device that, when B < C, drops us into the \u201cC is heaviest\u2019\u2019 part, but when B > C, skips forward to \u201cmark B\u2019\u2019.  \n   f) skips five statements, so we arrange exactly five statements after f) that belong to (or are jumped over from) the B-branch.  \n   We use k) (\u201cskip next two\u2019\u2019) as the first of those five; the remaining four will be supplied later.\n\n5. The instruction that begins the A-branch, c) (A vs C), must be reached when A > B (i.e. after d)\u2019s three-statement jump) and skipped when B-branch uses k).  \n   Therefore c) follows k).\n\n6. After c) we need to decide between A and C.  e) (\u201cIf A is heavier skip next four\u2019\u2019) accomplishes that.  \n\n7. The first statement executed when C turns out to be heaviest must be i) (\u201cmark C\u2019\u2019).  \n   Then we need l) (\u201cskip next three\u2019\u2019) so that, once C is marked, we jump over the later \u201cmark B\u2019\u2019 and \u201cmark A\u2019\u2019 and go straight to End.\n\n8. Immediately after the three-statement area that l) will jump over, we put the \u201cmark B\u2019\u2019 statement h).  \n   Following h) we need to skip over \u201cmark A\u2019\u2019 but still reach End; j) (\u201cskip next statement\u2019\u2019) does that.\n\n9. The next statement is g) (\u201cmark A\u2019\u2019).  \n   Finally, put m) (\u201cEnd\u2019\u2019) last.\n\nPutting the letters in the discovered order gives:\n\na  d  b  f  k  c  e  i  l  h  j  g  m\n\n\nStep\u2013by\u2013step check  \n\u2022 A > B branch: a \u2192 d skips (b,f,k) \u2192 c \u2192 if A > C, e skips (i,l,h,j) \u2192 g \u2192 m.  \n  If C > A, e falls through: i marks C, l skips (h,j,g) \u2192 m.  \n\u2022 B > A branch: a \u2192 d falls through \u2192 b \u2192 if B > C, f skips (k,c,e,i,l) \u2192 h, j skips g \u2192 m.  \n  If C > B, f falls through: k skips (c,e) \u2192 i marks C, l skips (h,j,g) \u2192 m.  \nAll possibilities mark the correct beam and finish at End.\n\nFinal answer: a, d, b, f, k, c, e, i, l, h, j, g, m", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 319, "completion_tokens": 8360, "total_tokens": 8679, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 7616, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

How the alarm works  \n   \u2022 The wires lie straight and parallel under the carpet, 8 cm apart.  \n   \u2022 If more than 4 kg is put on any ONE wire the alarm sounds.\n\n2.  What has to be achieved  \n   \u2022 Carlo (\u2248 74 kg) + anything he is standing on must be supported by many different wires at the same time so that the load on each wire is < 4 kg even when all of his weight is on one foot.\n\n   74 kg \u00f7 4 kg / wire = 18.5 \u2192 at least 19 wires must share the load.  \n   Spacing 8 cm \u2192 19 wires span 18 \u00d7 8 cm = 144 cm.  \n   So a \u201cshoe\u201d that is about 1.5 m long and is set down at right angles to the wires will rest on at least 19 wires and keep the load per wire below 4 kg.\n\n3.  Making the \u201cshoes\u201d  \n   \u2022 Saw the 5-metre 2 \u00d7 4 board into two equal pieces 2 m long (40 cm of board remains as scrap).  \n   \u2022 Each 2 m plank is 10 cm (4\u2033) wide and will cross \u2248 25 wires (2 m \u00f7 0.08 m \u2248 25).  \n     \u2011 With Carlo plus the plank (\u2248 84 kg altogether) on one foot, the load per wire is  \n       84 kg \u00f7 25 \u2248 3.4 kg < 4 kg \u2026 safe.  \n   \u2022 Fix each plank to a foot with two of the leather straps (one in front of the ankle, one behind).  \n     They are now 2-metre-long \u201csnow-shoes\u201d.\n\n4.  Crossing the room  \n   \u2022 Carlo turns the planks so they are exactly at right angles to the invisible wires.  \n   \u2022 He now walks to the centre: whenever he lifts one foot all of his weight goes onto the other plank, but that plank is already resting on about 25 different wires and no single wire is overloaded.  \n   \u2022 Walking is slow but perfectly possible\u2014he simply slides each \u201cshoe\u201d forward instead of lifting it high so that the long plank always lies squarely across the wires.\n\n5.  Taking the diamond  \n   \u2022 At the pedestal he slides one plank right up to it, kneels on that plank, and lifts the glass cover with the loose 40 cm piece of board (or with the hammer\u2019s claw) to avoid putting a hand on the floor.  \n   \u2022 He picks up the diamond (a few hundred grams\u2014negligible for the calculation), backs away the same way and leaves the room.\n\nThroughout the operation no wire ever carries as much as 4 kg, so the alarm is never triggered.\n\nFinal answer: Carlo saws the 5-metre 2 \u00d7 4 into two 2-metre planks, straps one plank to each foot as 2-metre-long \u201csnow-shoes\u201d, and walks to and from the pedestal; each plank rests on about 25 wires so every wire carries less than 4 kg, keeping the alarm silent while he removes the diamond.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 242, "completion_tokens": 3091, "total_tokens": 3333, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2368, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Because no further public information is ever supplied, no brown-eyed islander will ever become absolutely certain of his own eye colour, so none of them will ever risk an answer.\n\nConclusion  \nExactly the 100 blue-eyed islanders leave, all together, on the 100th night after the guru\u2019s statement; the 100 brown-eyed islanders (and the green-eyed guru) remain behind forever.\n\nFinal answer: The 100 blue-eyed islanders all leave together on the 100th night; no one else ever leaves.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens": 2986, "total_tokens": 3519, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2240, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Put Buster at the left end\n\nIf B were in an interior place, at least one end\u2013man would\nalso have exactly one handsome neighbour (he has only one neighbour),\ncontradicting the uniqueness of B.  \nHence B is at an end; call it place 1.\n\n          B(1) \u2013 A(2) \u2013 3 \u2013 4\n\nBecause B has exactly one handsome neighbour, A is handsome (H).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n5.

Fixing the scars\n\nBecause the two end\u2013men (B and C) are not Cliff (C is at 4), each of\nthem must have exactly one scarred neighbour.\nTherefore A is scarred (to give B his single scarred neighbour) and D\nis un-scarred (so that C has 0 scarred neighbours and is the exceptional\nman of the statement).\n\nTo make A have exactly one scarred neighbour, his\nother neighbour D must be un-scarred, and to give D exactly one scarred\nneighbour B must be scarred.  Summarising:\n\nB : S\u2003\u2003\u2003A : S\u2003\u2003\u2003D : \u00acS\u2003\u2003\u2003C : \u00acS  \n\nCounting scarred neighbours:\n\nB : 1\u2003 (A)  \nA : 1\u2003 (B)  \nD : 1\u2003 (A)  \nC : 0\u2003 (D)\n\nSo Cliff really is the only man whose number of scarred neighbours is\nnot 1.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n7.

Suppose the result is  \n\nA\u2081 < B\u2081 < C\u2081 < D\u2081 < E\u2081.  \n\nSo group A is the fastest group, B the next, etc.\n\nWhat horses can still be among the overall fastest three?\n\n\u2022 A\u2081, A\u2082, A\u2083            (the three quickest in the fastest group)  \n\u2022 B\u2081, B\u2082                (the two quickest in the second-fastest group)  \n\u2022 C\u2081                    (the quickest in the third-fastest group)\n\nNo other horse can reach the overall top three:\n\n\u2013 Anything behind A\u2083 in group A is slower than A\u2083.  \n\u2013 Anything behind B\u2082 in group B is slower than B\u2082.  \n\u2013 Every horse in groups D and E is slower than D\u2081 or E\u2081, which in turn are already proved slower than A\u2081, B\u2081 and C\u2081.  \n\nThus exactly six horses (A\u2081, A\u2082, A\u2083, B\u2081, B\u2082, C\u2081) still matter.\n\nStep 3.  Tie-breaker race of the six remaining candidates (Race 7).  \nRun those six; the first three to finish are necessarily the three fastest horses overall.\n\nTotal number of races used: 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nWhy 7 is minimal.  \nAfter the first five heats you have seen every horse once but cannot yet compare horses from different heats.  \nAt that moment at least five horses (the heat-winners) are still possible overall winners.  To decide the winner you must race them together, giving Race 6.  \nEven after that race there remain at least six logical candidates for the top three, as shown above; a single track can host only five at a time, so one more race is unavoidable.  \nTherefore no procedure can ever finish in fewer than 7 races, and the construction above attains that bound.\n\nFinal answer: 7", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens": 1439, "total_tokens": 1731, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 704, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Preliminary work in the machine room  \n   \u2022 While he is still inside, the brother puts the *machine* switch that belongs to every saw in the ON position.  \n   \u2022 Result: from now on a saw will work whenever, and only whenever, power is allowed to reach it through its back-up switch in the corridor.\n\n2.

Crackle\u2019s statement  \n\u201cI already knew that all three of our numbers were different.\u201d\n\nCrackle\u2019s certainty had to come from his own number y alone, before hearing Snap.  \nFor every admissible pair (x , z) with (1) he must have\n\n\u2022  y \u2260 x and y \u2260 z, and  \n\u2022  x \u2260 z.\n\n(a)  Could x = y or z = y ever occur?  \nIf x = y, then 2y + z = 14 \u21d2 z = 14 \u2013 2y > 0, which is possible when y \u2264 6.  \nSimilarly for z = y.  Therefore Crackle must have                y \u2265 7.   (3a)\n\n(b)  Could x = z ever occur?  \nThat would give 2x + y = 14 \u21d2 14 \u2013 y is even.  \nHence to rule this out Crackle must have                        14 \u2013 y odd  \n\u21d4 y is odd.

Listing the remaining possibilities  \n\nUse (1), (2) and (3) and keep x, y, z positive and all different.\n\ny = 7  \u21d2  x + z = 7 ; with x odd  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(x , z) = (5,2), (3,4), (1,6).\n\ny = 9  \u21d2  x + z = 5 ; with x odd  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(x , z) = (3,2), (1,4).\n\ny = 11 \u21d2  x + z = 3 ; with x odd  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(x , z) = (1,2).\n\ny = 13 gives x + z = 1, impossible.  \n\nThus every triple still possible after Crackle\u2019s remark is\n\n( x , y , z ) \u2208 {(5,7,2), (3,7,4), (1,7,6), (3,9,2), (1,9,4), (1,11,2)}.    (4)\n\nStep 4.  Pop\u2019s statement  \n\u201cNow I know what all three of our numbers are.\u201d\n\nPop knows z.  Hearing the earlier remarks, he surveys the list (4).  \nFor Pop to be able to identify x and y uniquely, only one triple in (4) may have\nhis particular z\u2013value.\n\nCount the occurrences of each z in (4):\n\nz = 2  appears in three triples,  \nz = 4  appears in two triples,  \nz = 6  appears in exactly one triple.\n\nTherefore Pop must have z = 6, and the unique compatible triple is\n\n( x , y , z ) = (1, 7, 6).                                    (5)\n\nStep 5.  Gretchen\u2019s deduction  \n\nGretchen, who has heard every statement but seen no number, performs exactly\nthe reasoning above.

Show that no four weights can reach 41 ounces.\n\nFrom (\u2605) we saw that after k\u20131 weights the sum S_{k\u20131} is the\nlargest amount already attainable; if w_k were bigger than 2S_{k\u20131}+1,\nthe amount S_{k\u20131}+1 could not be weighed.  \nApplying this recursively from the minimal first weight 1 forces the sums\nS_k to be 1, 4, 13, 40.  Therefore 40 is the absolute maximum reachable\nwith four weights; 41 ounces cannot be guaranteed.\n\nConclusion: With four integral weights placed on either pan, the greatest consecutive amount of gold dust that can be measured, starting from 1 ounce, is 40 ounces, achievable with weights of 1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, and 27 oz.\n\nFinal answer: 40", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 298, "completion_tokens": 1509, "total_tokens": 1807, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 704, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Mr Johnson\u2019s partner was a man.  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nStep A \u2013 Identify the grand-parents generation  \nBecause Mrs Williams partners her grandfather (6), some husband must be a grandfather.  \nBecause Mrs Johnson\u2019s father plays (4), the grandfather is that same man.  \nHence Mr Smith is taken to be the grandfather and Mrs Smith the grandmother.\n\nStep B \u2013 Work out the family tree  \nIf Mr Smith is Mrs Johnson\u2019s father, then Mrs Smith is Mrs Johnson\u2019s mother.  \nStatement 5 then says Mrs Smith partners her daughter; the daughters of the Smiths therefore include Mrs Johnson and exactly one other wife.  \nLet that other daughter be Mrs Jones (this will soon be forced).\n\nSince Mrs Johnson is a daughter of the Smiths, her daughter can naturally be Mrs Williams (who has married Mr Williams).  \nThus the tree is\n\nMr & Mrs Smith  \n\u2003\u2514\u2500 daughters:\u2003Mrs Johnson\u2003and\u2003Mrs Jones  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2514\u2500 Mrs Johnson\u2019s daughter:\u2003Mrs Williams\n\nAll stated relationships are now available.\n\nStep C \u2013 Use the bridge conditions\n\n\u2022  Mrs Williams must partner her grandfather Mr Smith (6).  \n   So Mr Smith \u2013 Mrs Williams is one partnership.\n\n\u2022  Mr Johnson plays against Mr Smith (4).  \n   Therefore Mr Johnson is at the same table but in the opposite pair to Mr Smith, and his partner is a man (7); the only remaining man is Mr Jones.  \n   Hence Mr Johnson \u2013 Mr Jones is the second partnership at that table.\n\nHence Table A is  \n\u2003Mr Johnson\u2003&\u2003Mr Jones\u2003vs\u2003Mr Smith\u2003&\u2003Mrs Williams\n\n\u2022  Mrs Johnson\u2019s partner must be her son-in-law, i.e. Mr Williams (1).  \n   Those two have not yet been seated, so they form a partnership at the other table.\n\n\u2022  The only players left un-partnered are Mrs Smith and Mrs Jones, who must therefore be partners; this also satisfies (5).  \n   Moreover, Mrs Jones now opposes her sister Mrs Johnson (3).\n\nHence Table B is  \n\u2003Mrs Johnson\u2003&\u2003Mr Williams\u2003vs\u2003Mrs Smith\u2003&\u2003Mrs Jones\n\nStep D \u2013 Check statement 2  \nMr Jones\u2019 partner is Mr Johnson.  \nMr Johnson is married to Mrs Johnson, who is Mrs Jones\u2019 sister.  \nThus Mr Johnson is indeed Mrs Jones\u2019 brother-in-law, so statement 2 holds.\n\nAll seven statements are satisfied.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer:  \n\nTable A:  Mr Johnson & Mr Jones (partners)\u2003played against\u2003Mr Smith & Mrs Williams (partners)\n\nTable B:  Mrs Johnson & Mr Williams (partners)\u2003played against\u2003Mrs Smith & Mrs Jones (partners)", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 327, "completion_tokens": 5104, "total_tokens": 5431, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 4160, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Using the prime\u2013adjacency table\n\n        5 :  6 , 8\n        6 :  5 , 7 , 11\n        7 :  6 , 10 , 4\n        8 :  5 , 9 , 11\n        9 :  8 ,10 ,4\n       10 :  7 , 9\n\n    two (and only two) sequences work:\n\n        4 \u2013 7 \u2013 10 \u2013 9 \u2013 8 \u2013 5 \u2013 6 \u2013 11\n        4 \u2013 9 \u2013 10 \u2013 7 \u2013 6 \u2013 5 \u2013 8 \u2013 11 .\n\n5.  The two complete clocks  \n    Putting the fixed half and the newly found half together we obtain,\n    reading clockwise from 12,\n\n        Solution A : 12  1  2  3  4  7 10  9  8  5  6 11\n        Solution B : 12  1  2  3  4  9 10  7  6  5  8 11\n\n    Check of adjacent sums (for Solution A):\n        12+1=13, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7, 4+7=11,\n        7+10=17, 10+9=19, 9+8=17, 8+5=13,\n        5+6=11, 6+11=17, 11+12=23 \u2013 all prime.\n    Solution B is verified analogously.\n\nHence Mad Ade really can keep one half of his clock untouched and rearrange\nthe other half, and the only two possible ways (up to reading the clock\nbackwards) are\n\n    \u2022 12\u20131\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20137\u201310\u20139\u20138\u20135\u20136\u201311\n    \u2022 12\u20131\u20132\u20133\u20134\u20139\u201310\u20137\u20136\u20135\u20138\u201311.\n\nFinal answer:  \nClock arrangements satisfying the requirement are  \n\n1) 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9, 8, 5, 6, 11 (clockwise),  \n2) 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 7, 6, 5, 8, 11 (clockwise).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens": 8554, "total_tokens": 8880, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 7424, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Quinn has no sugar in the end, so no sugar is allowed to reach her at any moment.  \n   \u2022 If Kaleb had started with sugar, the 15th action (Kaleb \u2194 Quinn) would have put sugar into Quinn.  \n     So Kaleb did not start with sugar.  \n   \u2022 If Oscar had started with sugar, the 11th action (Oscar \u2194 Quinn) would have put sugar into Quinn.  \n     So Oscar did not start with sugar.  \n   \u2022 Quinn herself was one of the two sugared bowls? Impossible, because then she would still possess sugar.  \n   Hence the only bowls that can still contain the original sugar are Misty and Ryan.\n\n4. It remains to check that starting with sugar in Misty and in Ryan never forces sugar into Emma or Quinn.  \n   \u2022 Misty meets the big group only in the 12th action (Misty \u2194 Callie) and in the 13th (Alice\u2013Misty\u2013Oscar).  \n     Neither of those two actions can pass sugar to Tina before action 14, so Emma never receives sugar.  \n     Quinn has already finished all her mixing before Misty ever shares her batter, so Quinn never sees Misty\u2019s sugar either.  \n   \u2022 Ryan\u2019s first mixing is the 18th action (Ryan\u2013Luke\u2013Watt), well after both Emma\u2019s and Quinn\u2019s last contacts;  \n     therefore Ryan\u2019s sugar reaches neither Emma nor Quinn.\n\nSince every other possibility contradicts Emma\u2019s or Quinn\u2019s final sugar-free condition, the two bowls that originally received all the sugar must be Misty\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s.\n\nFinal answer: Misty and Ryan", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens": 7161, "total_tokens": 7654, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 6592, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

The moment C\u2019s mental count reaches 22 he announces  \n      \u201cAll of us have visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nWhy this works\n\n\u2022  Only an Ordinary prisoner who has never reported before is ever allowed to\n   turn switch A from OFF to ON.  Thus each of the 22 Ordinaries will make\n   that change at most once.\n\n\u2022  Whenever switch A is found ON, it must have been turned ON by some\n   Ordinary prisoner who had not yet reported.  The next time the Counter\n   is led into the room he will see A ON, turn it OFF, and add 1 to his\n   count.  Therefore each Ordinary prisoner\u2019s first successful report is\n   registered exactly once in the Counter\u2019s tally.\n\n\u2022  Because the warden selects prisoners at random and gives unlimited time,\n   every Ordinary prisoner is taken to the room infinitely many times.\n   If a particular Ordinary prisoner has not yet reported, sooner or later\n   he will enter when A is OFF and succeed in turning it ON.  Hence every\n   one of the 22 Ordinaries will eventually be counted.\n\n\u2022  When the Counter has accumulated 22 counts he knows that each of the 22\n   Ordinaries has reported once, which means every one of the 23 prisoners\n   has been in the switch room at least once (the Counter himself obviously\n   has).  At that instant the declaration is certainly correct.\n\n\u2022  It is impossible for the Counter to reach 22 prematurely: the only way\n   his count increases is by turning A OFF after finding it ON, and that can\n   happen at most once for each Ordinary prisoner.\n\nHence the strategy is safe (no false declaration) and sure to succeed (a\ntrue declaration will eventually be made).\n\nFinal answer:  Use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless toggle.  \nOne prisoner is the Counter.  Each ordinary prisoner flips A from OFF to ON\nexactly once (the first time he finds A OFF), otherwise flips B.  The\nCounter flips A from ON to OFF, adding 1 to his tally, otherwise flips B.\nWhen his tally reaches 22 he announces that everyone has visited; the\nannouncement is then certainly true.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 497, "completion_tokens": 1644, "total_tokens": 2141, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 832, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Put Radishes (already fixed on 25 May) into 4 rows \u2014 they are the earliest planting, satisfying the \u201c4-rows first\u201d rule and leaving room above (Tomatoes) and below (Broccoli).\n\n10. South-side 3-row planting must be 29 May (because 27 May is West, 28 May is Broccoli, 25 May is East).  \n\u2003The only vegetable already on 29 May is Peppers, so Peppers are the SOUTH-side crop with 3 rows.\n\n11.  Peppers (3 rows) > Broccoli, so Broccoli must have 1 or 2 rows.  \n\u2003Choose 1 row for Broccoli, leaving the even number 2 available for the NW corner.\n\n12.  \u201cSouth one day before Lettuce\u201d: 29 May (South) \u2192 Lettuce 30 May.  \n\u2003Lettuce must be < 3 rows, so assign it 2 rows.  That puts Lettuce in the NW corner (even rows, not Peppers/Tomatoes).\n\n13.  The only vegetable left unplaced is Tomatoes.  \n\u2003Tomatoes cannot be East or NW, so Tomatoes go to the remaining unfilled place: the WEST side (27 May).  \n\u2003Tomatoes must have the only remaining unused row-count, 5 rows.\n\n14.

Observe what 15 \u201crows\u201d we may reasonably try to use.  \n    A regular pentagon supplies 5 straight\u2010line edges.  \n    The five long diagonals of that pentagon form a regular five-pointed star (a\n    pentagram); the star consists of 5 more straight lines.  \n    Finally the 5 chords that join the five intersection points of the star form a\n    smaller (inner) pentagon \u2013 another 5 straight lines.  \n    Hence the figure made by drawing an ordinary pentagram together with both the\n    outer and inner pentagons naturally gives\n          5 (outer edges) + 5 (star lines) + 5 (inner edges) = 15 straight lines,\n    exactly the number of rows we want.\n\n2.  We must place 16 coins on the figure so that every one of those 15 lines\n    contains 4 coins.  Because each of the 15 rows must contain 4 coins, altogether\n    the 15\u00b74 = 60 \u201ccoin\u2013row incidences\u201d have to be supplied by the 16 coins; on the\n    average each coin must therefore lie on 60/16 = 3 \u00be \u2248 4 different rows.  In the\n    pentagram figure many of the obvious positions (vertices or intersections) are\n    incident with exactly four of the chosen 15 lines, so it is plausible that 16\n    suitably selected such positions will work.\n\n3.  Label the outer pentagon\u2019s vertices A, B, C, D, E cyclically.\n    The five star lines are AC, CE, EA, BD, DB.  (Any cyclic\n    renaming works, of course.)\n    Call the five points where pairs of star-lines cross P, Q, R, S, T;\n    those are the vertices of the inner pentagon.\n\n4.  Place one coin at every one of the following 16 points:\n\n        the 5 outer vertices:    A, B, C, D, E             (five coins)\n        the 5 inner vertices:    P, Q, R, S, T             (five coins)\n        the 5 mid-points of the outer edges:\n                                 AB, BC, CD, DE, EA        (five coins)\n        the centre O of the whole figure                   (one coin)\n                                                         ----------------\n                                                           16 coins\n\n    (The mid-point of AB is the half-way point of the edge AB, etc.; and \u201cthe\n    centre\u201d means the common centre of the two concentric pentagons.)\n\n5.  Check that every one of the 15 chosen straight lines contains 4 of those 16\n    coins.\n\n      \u2022 Each OUTER edge such as AB now has\n            A  \u2013 its outer vertex,\n            mid-point AB,\n            centre O  (because that mid-point, O, and the opposite mid-point line up),\n            and the opposite outer vertex D\n        altogether 4 coins.  (A similar verification holds for BC, CD, DE, EA.)\n\n      \u2022 Each STAR line, e.g. AC, runs through\n            A, the vertex,\n            P  (where AC crosses BD),\n            centre O,\n            C, the other vertex,\n        again 4 coins.  All 5 star lines are completely analogous.\n\n      \u2022 Each INNER edge, say PQ, has\n            P, Q  (its endpoints),\n            the mid-point CD (because PQ, CD, and O are collinear),\n            and the centre O,\n        once more making 4 coins.  There are 5 such inner edges, all alike.\n\n    Thus every one of the 15 straight lines (rows) indeed contains precisely 4 of\n    the 16 coins.\n\n6.  Consequently Johnny could \u2013 and did \u2013 put his 16 coins in exactly those\n    positions; Mark therefore had to let him keep the lot.\n\nFinal answer:  Arrange the 16 coins on a regular pentagram together with its outer\nand inner pentagons, using the 5 outer vertices, the 5 star-intersection points,\nthe 5 edge mid-points of the outer pentagon, and the centre; then each of the 15\nstraight lines (5 outer edges, 5 star lines, 5 inner edges) passes through exactly\n4 coins.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 174, "completion_tokens": 3269, "total_tokens": 3443, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2304, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

We will talk about the PARITY (evenness / oddness) of black hats.  \n   Even number of black hats  \u2192 code-word \u201cblack\u201d.  \n   Odd  number of black hats  \u2192 code-word \u201cwhite\u201d.\n\n2.

He sees #1-#8.  Let k be the number of black hats he sees.  \n  If #10 said \u201cblack\u201d (even) and k is even, then #9 must be white;  \n  if #10 said \u201cblack\u201d and k is odd, then #9 must be black;  \n  if #10 said \u201cwhite\u201d (odd) the conclusions are reversed.  \n  Hence #9 is certain.\n\n\u2022 After #9\u2019s correct announcement the others know whether #9\u2019s hat was black or white and therefore can update the running parity before #8 speaks, and so on.  Induction shows that #8, #7, \u2026, #1 will all be correct.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nGuaranteed outcome\n--------------------------------------------------\nPerson #10 survives with probability \u00bd.  \nPersons #9, #8, \u2026, #1 survive with probability 1.\n\nThus at least 9 out of the 10 (90 %) are saved for sure, and there is a 50 % chance that all 10 survive.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nA concrete example\n--------------------------------------------------\nSuppose the actual hats (seen from the back) are  \n\n#10 ?  #9 B  #8 W  #7 B  #6 B  #5 W  #4 W  #3 B  #2 W  #1 W\n\n1. #10 sees 4 black hats in front (even) \u2192 says \u201cblack\u201d.  \n   (He lives if his own hat is black.)\n\nRunning parity required among #1-#9: even.\n\n2. #9 sees 4 blacks among #1-#8 (even).  \n   Even is already satisfied, so his own hat must be white.  \n   He says \u201cwhite\u201d and survives.\n\n3. #8 now knows that so far the running parity is still even and that he sees\n   3 blacks ahead (odd).  To make the overall parity even, his own hat must be black.\n   He says \u201cblack\u201d and survives.\n\n4. Everyone updates; the procedure repeats down the line. All remaining 7 people are certain and survive.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nFinal answer\n--------------------------------------------------\nHave #10 announce the parity of black hats in front of him: say \u201cblack\u201d if he sees an even number of black hats, \u201cwhite\u201d if he sees an odd number.  Every later speaker keeps track of the parity that should still hold, compares it with what he sees ahead and has already heard behind, and from that deduces his own colour with certainty.  Consequently #9, #8, \u2026, #1 are all saved, while #10 survives with 50 % probability.  Hence at least 9 out of the 10 islanders (90 %) are guaranteed to live, which is the optimal attainable rate under the rules.\n\nFinal answer: an optimal strategy guarantees 9 survivors (and, with 50 % probability, all 10).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 618, "completion_tokens": 1803, "total_tokens": 2421, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 576, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Finding the Cupid  \n    Statement 7 (by truthful June): \u201cEmma knows Draco\u2019s role\u201d.  \n    The simplest way for Emma to know Draco\u2019s role is that the two of them\n    were put into a lovers-pair by Cupid (lovers see each other\u2019s roles).  \n    Because Cupid cannot pair him-/herself, the Cupid cannot be Emma.\n\n    Statement 13 (by June): \u201cThe Cupid wasn\u2019t switched\u201d \u2013 so whoever is\n    Cupid never changes roles.\n\n    Combining these with statement 1 (\u201cCarl is not Cupid\u201d \u2013 said before the\n    switch and true) shows that\n\n            June = Cupid,  \n            and she paired Emma with Draco.\n\n    Therefore Emma and Draco each know the other\u2019s role, explaining\n    statements 3 and 7, while Emma can still truthfully say she doesn\u2019t\n    know the Spy (11).\n\n7.  Normal role  \n    From (10): \u201cDraco or June is Normal\u201d.  \n    June is already Cupid, hence\n\n            Draco = Normal.\n\n8.  Remaining unassigned roles  \n    We have now used:  \n       Normal (Draco), Detective (Xavior), Cupid (June).  \n    Left to place: Switcher, Spy, Liar.\n\n    Ivy is already the Liar.  \n    Spy is Carl or June \u2013 June is Cupid, so\n\n            Carl = Spy.\n\n    The only role still unplaced is Switcher, so\n\n            Emma = Switcher.\n\n9.

The table below shows the counts before those four statements are considered, and then after they and A3 are added.\n\n              Before the two pairs            After the two pairs & A3\n              (A3 not yet counted)             (A3 is TRUE)\n\nGuilty = B :   T = 3 , F = 4        \u2192  T = 3+2+1 = 6 , F = 4+2   = 6  \u2713\nGuilty = A :   T = 4 , F = 3        \u2192  T = 4+2+1 = 7 , F = 3+2   = 5  \u2717\nGuilty = C :   T = 4 , F = 3        \u2192  T = 7 , F = 5                           \u2717\nGuilty = D :   T = 4 , F = 3        \u2192  T = 7 , F = 5                           \u2717\n\nExplanation of the first line (B guilty).  \nWhen B is guilty we can immediately evaluate the seven statements that talk about guilt:\n\n\u2022 A2 (B is guilty) \u2013 true  \n\u2022 B3 (I am innocent) \u2013 false  \n\u2022 C2 (B not guilty) \u2013 false  \n\u2022 B1 (D did not do it) \u2013 true  \n\u2022 D1 (B1 is false) \u2013 false  \n\u2022 D3 (A did it) \u2013 false  \n\u2022 B2 (D3 is false) \u2013 true  \n\nThat gives T = 3, F = 4.  \nAdding (+2, +2) from the contradiction pairs and (+1, +0) from A3 being true produces T = 6, F = 6 exactly.\n\nFor A, C or D as the thief one inevitably obtains 7 true and 5 false statements when A3 is fixed as true, contradicting the requirement of six each.  (If one tried to force the count to 6\u20136 by making A3 false, the story\u2019s opening sentence would be violated.)\n\nTherefore the only assignment that satisfies every condition is that Suspect B is the car thief.\n\nFinal answer: B", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens": 5052, "total_tokens": 5401, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 4160, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

If that happened the Emperor would have to find somebody else,\n    lose time, and almost certainly spend far more than the original\n    $800 000.  The cheap bid therefore carried considerable risk.\n\n3.  Company B came back with an \u201cinsurance\u2013type\u201d proposal that used\n    company A\u2019s offer as part of the plan.  B told the Emperor:\n\n       \u201cYour total outlay will never exceed one million dollars and the\n        bridge will definitely be finished.

Why the Emperor accepted  \n    Spending an extra $200 000 above A\u2019s bare bid bought him a rock-solid\n    completion guarantee and removed every financial surprise that the risky\n    project might spring on his small country.  That certainty was well worth\n    the premium, so he accepted B\u2019s scheme.\n\n6.  What actually happened  \n    Company A, after looking more closely at the dangers, declined to begin\n    the work.  Under the agreed terms the Emperor invoked the third option\n    and ordered B to do the whole job.  Consequently B received the full\n    $1 000 000, all in strict accordance with the contract\u2014no lies, no\n    cheating, no swindle.\n\nFinal answer: Company B sold the Emperor an \u201cinsurance\u201d contract: $200 000 was a non-refundable premium guaranteeing that, whatever company A did or failed to do, the bridge would be finished for a total cost that would never exceed $1 000 000.

What does the flower want?  \n   \u2013 It dislikes the hard work of making poison (assumption 5).  \n   \u2013 It dislikes being eaten even more (assumption 3).  \n   Hence the flower will produce poison only if that is necessary to keep it alive (assumption 6).\n\n3. What does the dog know?  \n   \u2013 It knows every point in step 2 (assumptions 10 & 11).  \n   \u2013 It also knows it can never observe whether poison was made (assumption 12).  \n   Therefore its decision cannot be based on any direct information about poison.  \n   It must choose a single policy, E or \u00acE, that will be carried out regardless of what the flower actually did (hint 1).\n\n4. How will a rational flower reason about the dog?  \n   The flower knows the dog is rational (assumption 2).  \n   Consequently it predicts what the dog\u2019s single policy will be and then acts in its own best interest:  \n   \u2022 If the flower predicts E, it chooses P (poison) to avoid being eaten.  \n   \u2022 If the flower predicts \u00acE, it chooses \u00acP, sparing itself the trouble of making poison.\n\n5. From the dog\u2019s point of view the two consistent \u201cpackages\u201d of behaviour are therefore  \n      (a)  E  &  P        (dog eats, flower poisons)  \n      (b) \u00acE  & \u00acP        (dog does not eat, flower does not poison)\n\n   Any other combination would be irrational for at least one of them.\n\n6.

Because the dog\u2019s own choice is what determines which package is logically consistent, it selects \u00acE.  \n   Knowing this, the flower has no reason to make poison and therefore selects \u00acP.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unique pair of actions compatible with common knowledge of perfect rationality is\n      Dog: do not eat the flower.  \n      Flower: do not produce poison.\n\nFinal answer: The dog will not eat the flower, because if it intended to eat, the rational flower would certainly have produced poison, killing the dog; by refraining from eating, the dog at least keeps its 50 % chance of surviving the virus.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1060, "completion_tokens": 1517, "total_tokens": 2577, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 896, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

A key observation about gaps  \nSuppose after the first k weights we can form every integer from 1 up to T.  \nLet wk+1 be the next (heaviest) weight we add.  With the old k weights we can already\nproduce every number in the interval [\u2212T , T].  Adding wk+1 enlarges the reachable\nintervals to [\u2212(T+wk+1) , T+wk+1].  \n\nHowever, to be able to hit every integer with no gaps, wk+1 must not be so large that\nan \u201cunreachable hole\u2019\u2019 appears between the numbers \u2264 T and those that use wk+1.\nA little algebra shows that no gaps exist iff\n\n\u2003\u2003wk+1 \u2264 2T + 1.\u2003(2)\n\n(If wk+1 = 2T+2 or more, the numbers T+1, T+2, \u2026 , wk+1\u2212T\u22121 would be missing.)\n\nStep 3.  Choose each weight as large as the gap\u2010free condition allows  \nStart with no weights: T0 = 0.\n\nWeight 1.  Condition (2) with T0 = 0 gives w1 \u2264 1.  Take the largest possible, w1 = 1.  \nNow T1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nWeight 2.  Condition (2) with T1 = 1 gives w2 \u2264 2\u00b71 + 1 = 3.  Take w2 = 3.  \nNow T2 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWeight 3.  Condition (2) with T2 = 4 gives w3 \u2264 2\u00b74 + 1 = 9.  Take w3 = 9.  \nNow T3 = 4 + 9 = 13.\n\nWeight 4.  Condition (2) with T3 = 13 gives w4 \u2264 2\u00b713 + 1 = 27.  Take w4 = 27.  \nNow T4 = 13 + 27 = 40.\n\nStep 4.  Verify that every integer 1 \u2013 40 is attainable  \nBecause each choice above met the equality in (2), the construction guarantees there\nare no gaps, so every number from 1 up to the new total T4 is obtainable.\n(Equivalently, 1, 3, 9, 27 are the first four powers of 3; balanced-ternary\nrepresentation covers every integer from 1 through (3\u2074\u22121)/2 = 40.)\n\nStep 5.  Show that 40 is the best possible  \nThe largest positive reading we can ever get is when all four weights sit on the same\npan as the gold: that is just their sum w1+w2+w3+w4.  With any four non-negative\nweights this sum is an absolute upper bound on what can be weighed.  \nOur chosen set sums to 1+3+9+27 = 40, and we have already shown 1 \u2013 40 are all\nattainable, so 40 cannot be improved.\n\nTherefore the assessor, with exactly four weights and with freedom to place them on\neither pan, can measure every whole number of ounces from 1 up to (and including)\n\n\u2003\u200340 ounces.\n\nFinal answer: 40", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 189, "completion_tokens": 2974, "total_tokens": 3163, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2112, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Why this works \u2013 the formal proof  \n    Let H\u2081, H\u2082, \u2026 , H\u2099 be the real hat colours (0 = black, 1 = white).  \n    Let P = H\u2081 + H\u2082 + \u2026 + H\u2099 (mod 2) be the parity of the total number of white hats.  \n\n    What prisoner k can see is  \n            S\u2096 = H\u2081 + \u2026 + H\u2096\u208b\u2081 + H\u2096\u208a\u2081 + \u2026 + H\u2099   (mod 2)  \n          = P \u2212 H\u2096 (mod 2).  \n\n    His announced guess G\u2096 is  \n            G\u2096 = 0  if S\u2096 is even        \u2192  G\u2096 = S\u2096  \n                 1  if S\u2096 is odd         \u2192  G\u2096 = S\u2096  \n\n          So  G\u2096 = S\u2096 = P \u2212 H\u2096   (mod 2)  \n          \u21d2  G\u2096 = H\u2096  when P = 0 (total number of whites even)  \n          \u21d2  G\u2096 = 1 \u2212 H\u2096 when P = 1 (total number of whites odd).\n\n    Therefore  \n        \u2022 If P = 0, every G\u2096 equals H\u2096  \u2192 everybody is right.  \n        \u2022 If P = 1, every G\u2096 equals 1 \u2212 H\u2096 \u2192 everybody is wrong.  \n\n    In either case the whole group satisfies the warden\u2019s release condition.\n\n5.  Why the warden cannot foil them  \n    Whatever assignment of hats the warden chooses fixes the parity P.  \n    Their rule automatically puts them in the \u201call right\u201d state when P = 0  \n    and in the \u201call wrong\u201d state when P = 1.  \n    The warden has no third option, so he cannot prevent their escape.\n\n6.  Example with five prisoners  \n    Actual hats: 1 0 0 1 1  (three whites \u2192 P = 1, odd).  \n    Everybody counts whites he sees:  \n        Prisoner 1 sees 0,0,1,1 \u2192 two whites \u2192 even \u2192 says 0 (black)  \n        Prisoner 2 sees 1,0,1,1 \u2192 three whites \u2192 odd  \u2192 says 1 (white)  \n        Prisoner 3 sees 1,0,1,1 \u2192 three whites \u2192 odd  \u2192 says 1 (white)  \n        Prisoner 4 sees 1,0,0,1 \u2192 two whites  \u2192 even \u2192 says 0 (black)  \n        Prisoner 5 sees 1,0,0,1 \u2192 two whites  \u2192 even \u2192 says 0 (black)  \n    Announcements: 0 1 1 0 0, i.e. the exact opposite of 1 0 0 1 1 \u2013 they are all wrong, hence they go free.\n\nFinal answer:  \nAll agree in advance that each prisoner will count the number of white hats he sees.  \nIf he sees an even number he will announce \u201cblack\u201d; if he sees an odd number he will announce \u201cwhite\u201d (or the opposite convention).  \nThen, when the hats are placed, either the total number of white hats is even\u2014in which case every prisoner\u2019s announcement matches his real hat\u2014or it is odd\u2014in which case every announcement is the opposite of his real hat.  Thus the whole group is either entirely right or entirely wrong, guaranteeing their escape.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens": 1858, "total_tokens": 2149, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 768, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Where can Walter row?  \nFact 3 says Walter can row only when he is alone, i.e. only on a return\nvoyage.  \nTherefore Walter rows either voyage \u2461 or voyage \u2463 \u2013 exactly once.\n\nStep 2.  The voyage on which Walter rows fixes the voyage just before it.  \nIf Walter rows voyage \u2461, he must have reached the finish side in voyage \u2460,\nso he had to be a passenger in voyage \u2460.  \nIf Walter rows voyage \u2463, he must have reached the finish side in voyage \u2462,\nso he had to be a passenger in voyage \u2462.\n\nStep 3.  Xavier cannot be the oarsman on the voyage that carries Walter\nto the finish side.  \nXavier can row only (i) alone or (ii) with Yoshi as passenger (Fact 4);\nbut the passenger in that voyage is Walter, not Yoshi.  \nHence the oarsman who first carries Walter across is Yoshi or Zeke.\n\nStep 4.  Make Walter the oarsman of voyage \u2461 (the other case is analogous).  \nTake Zeke to row Walter across in voyage \u2460:\n\n     \u2460  Zeke rows, Walter passenger   \u2192  finish side now: Zeke, Walter\n\nNow Walter rows back alone:\n\n     \u2461  Walter rows back alone        \u2192  finish side now: Zeke\n\nStep 5.

Somebody must return in voyage \u2463 to fetch Walter.  \nZeke and Xavier have each rowed once; Walter has already rowed once; only\nYoshi has rowed zero times so far, so Yoshi must be the man who rows back:\n\n     \u2463  Yoshi rows back alone         \u2192  start side: Walter, Yoshi\n                                         (each of Zeke, Xavier, Yoshi has rowed once)\n\nStep 7.  The last trip (\u2464) must take Walter and one other man to the finish\nside.  Walter cannot row outward, so Yoshi must row again:\n\n     \u2464  Yoshi rows, Walter passenger  \u2192  all four men on the finish side\n\nCounting how often each man has rowed we get\n\n     Walter : 1 time  (voyage \u2461)\n     Xavier : 1 time  (voyage \u2462)\n     Zeke   : 1 time  (voyage \u2460)\n     Yoshi  : 2 times (voyages \u2463 and \u2464)\n\nStep 8.  Could anyone other than Yoshi have rowed twice?\nNo.  Walter is forbidden to row twice by Fact 3.  \nXavier can row twice only if he rows once with Yoshi and once alone,\nbut then Yoshi would necessarily have to row one of the two return voyages,\ngiving Yoshi two rows as well.  \nZeke can row twice only by rowing both return voyages, but Walter must row\none of those.
