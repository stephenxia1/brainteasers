0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Strategy the prisoners agree on during their one-time meeting

1. Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.

2. Decide that  
   • switch A will be the counting switch,  
   • switch B is just a “dummy’’ switch that can be flipped any time a prisoner is forced to move some switch but does not want to change the value of A.

   The warden has told them that both switches are now OFF, so everybody knows the initial state.

Rules each prisoner follows later

COUNTER’S RULES  
• He keeps in his memory a number Count, initially 0.  
• Every time he is taken to the switch room

    – If switch A is ON, he flips A to OFF and sets  
      Count ← Count + 1.  

    – If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B (so that he does satisfy the “must flip exactly one switch’’ rule).

• Whenever Count reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  
  “All of us have visited the switch room.”

NON-COUNTER’S RULES  
Each non-counter remembers a personal flag called Signalled, initially FALSE.

When he is taken to the switch room he does the following.

    – If Signalled = FALSE and switch A is OFF  
      (that is, he has never succeeded in signalling before and A is currently OFF)  
      * flip switch A from OFF to ON, and  
      * set Signalled ← TRUE.  
      (This is his one and only contribution to the count.)

    – Otherwise  
      flip switch B (again, just to comply with the “must flip one switch’’ rule).

Why the strategy works

1. Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).

2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.

3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.

4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random “indefinitely’’ (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.

5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter’s declaration is certainly true.

6. Premature declaration is impossible:  
   • For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  
   • A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  
   • That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  
   • A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  
   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.

Consequently the counter’s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF→ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON→OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.",True

Step-by-step deduction

4) D = G·4  or  D = E/3  
If D = G·4, G can be 0,1,2 giving (G,D) = (0,0), (1,4), (2,8).  
(G,D) = (0,0) repeats a digit, so exclude.  
Keep two possibilities: (1,4) or (2,8).

If D = E/3, D ≤ 3 while E is a multiple of 3.  This would repeat a digit when (G,D) = (1,4) or (2,8), so we stay with D = G·4 and the two pairs above.

5) E = J – 1  or  E = D/4  
With (G,D) = (1,4) ⇒ D/4 = 1 duplicates G, impossible.  
With (G,D) = (2,8) ⇒ D/4 = 2 duplicates G, impossible.  
Hence E = J – 1 (so J = E + 1) and D = G·4 with (G,D) = (2,8).

Thus far:  G = 2,  D = 8,  J = E + 1.

7) G = F + 1  or  G = I – 3  
With G = 2:  
 • If G = F + 1 ⇒ F = 1.  
 • If G = I – 3 ⇒ I = 5 duplicates neither but we will see it fails later.  
Take G = F + 1 so F = 1 (will soon be forced).

6) F = B·2  or  F = A – 4  
F = 1 cannot equal B·2 (no integer B), so F = A – 4 ⇒ A = 5.

1) A = B/3  or  A = G + 3  
Now A = 5 and G = 2, so A = G + 3 holds (5 = 2 + 3).  
Therefore A ≠ B/3 and B is still unknown.

8) H = A/2  or  H = C·3  
A/2 = 2.5 not integral, so H = C·3 and C ≤ 3.

3) C = J + 2  or  C = F·3  
Since F = 1, F·3 = 3 is possible and keeps C ≤ 3.  
Choose C = 3 (from C = F·3).

Then 8) gives H = 3·3 = 9.

9) I = H + 3  or  I = D/2  
H + 3 = 12 impossible, so I = D/2 = 8/2 = 4.

2) B = I – 4  or  B = E + 4  
With I = 4, I – 4 = 0, so one valid choice is B = 0.

Digits used so far: A5, B0, C3, D8, F1, G2, H9, I4.  
Remaining digits {6,7} must be E and J, and since J = E + 1 we get  
E = 6, J = 7.

10) J = H – 2  or  J = C·2  
H – 2 = 9 – 2 = 7, matching J, so the first alternative is satisfied.

Final answer: 5038612947",True
4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the 1000 equally–spaced points  
0,1,2,…,999 around a circle.

Choose an integer step-size s (1 ≤ s ≤ 999) and start at 0.  
Join 0 to s, then s to 2s, then 2s to 3s, … each time reducing modulo 1000.  
A single unbroken “star” is obtained exactly when

1. gcd(1000, s)=1 (so every vertex is met before we get back to 0),  
2. s≠1, 999 (otherwise the figure is just the regular 1000-gon).

Condition 1 means s must be coprime with 1000; the number of such s is Euler’s totient
φ(1000).

 1000 = 2³·5³  
 φ(1000) = 1000(1−½)(1−⅕) = 1000·½·⅘ = 400.

Among these 400 admissible s-values, one pair is {1,999}; remove it, leaving 398.

The step-sizes s and 1000−s trace the same picture, only in opposite directions,
so each star is counted twice.  Hence

number of distinct stars = (398)/2 = 199.

Final answer: 199",True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

15,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.
The rest go like this-
1st House: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Cats, Dunhill
2nd House: Blue, Dane, Tea, Horse, Blends
3rd House: Red, Brit, Milk, Birds, Pall Malls
4th House: Green, German, Coffee, FISH, Prince
5th House: White, Swede, Beer, Dogs, Bluemasters",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the five houses stand in a row, numbered 1 (leftmost) to 5 (rightmost).  
For every house we have to determine  

• colour • nationality • drink • cigar • pet  

and each attribute must occur exactly once.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Set down the immediately fixed facts
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 9: House 1 = Norwegian  
Rule 8: House 3 drinks Milk  
Rule 14: Norwegian lives next to the blue house  ⇒  House 2 = Blue

─────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Locate the Green and White houses
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 4: Green is immediately left of White.

The pair (Green, White) cannot be (1,2) because 2 is already Blue;  
not (2,3) because 2 is Blue;  
not (3,4) because 3 already drinks Milk but rule 5 says Green drinks Coffee.

Therefore (Green, White) = (4,5).  
Rule 5 then gives: House 4 drinks Coffee.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Find the remaining colours
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Colours used so far: Blue(2), Green(4), White(5).  
The two colours left are Red and Yellow, for houses 1 and 3.

Rule 7: Yellow-house smokes Dunhill.  
Two cases:

A. House 1 = Yellow (⇒ Dunhill in 1)  
B. House 3 = Yellow (⇒ Dunhill in 3)

Case A quickly proves consistent; Case B sooner or later contradicts several rules.  
We continue with Case A.

So far
House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Dunhill  
House 3: Red

Rule 1: Brit lives in the Red house  ⇒  House 3 = Brit.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Use the Dunhill / horse neighbour rule
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 11: Horse owner lives next to Dunhill.  
Dunhill is in house 1, so the neighbour is house 2.  
⇒ House 2 keeps a Horse.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Work with Blends, Water and Cats
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 15: Blends smoker lives next to Water drinker.  
Rule 10: Blends smoker lives next to Cat keeper.

If Water were anywhere except house 1 we would run into a dead end,  
so place Water in house 1.  
Then Blends must be in its only neighbour, house 2, satisfying rule 15.  
To satisfy rule 10 as well, put Cats in house 1.

Now
House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Dunhill, Cats  
House 2: Blue, –, –, Blends, Horse

─────────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Identify the Dane and his drink
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The Dane drinks Tea (rule 3).  
Tea is still unassigned and the only house that can take it so far is house 2.  
⇒ House 2 = Dane, drinks Tea.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
7.  Place Beer and Bluemasters
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Drinks used: Water(1), Tea(2), Milk(3), Coffee(4).  
The only drink left is Beer, so Beer is in house 5.  
Rule 12: Bluemasters smoker drinks Beer  ⇒  house 5 smokes Bluemasters.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
8.  Locate Prince and the German
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Cigars left: Pall Mall, Prince.  
Rule 13: German smokes Prince.

If Prince were in house 3 (Brit) or house 5 (already Bluemasters) we'd clash,  
so Prince must be in house 4, making house 4 the German.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
9.  Put Pall Mall and Birds
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The last unassigned cigar is Pall Mall, so it belongs to house 3.  
Rule 6: Pall Mall smoker keeps Birds  ⇒  house 3 keeps Birds.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
10.  Finish the pets and nationalities
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Pets assigned so far: Cats(1), Horse(2), Birds(3).  
Left: Dogs and Fish.

Rule 2: Swede keeps Dogs  ⇒  house 5 is the Swede with Dogs.  
The only pet still missing is Fish, therefore house 4 keeps Fish.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
11.  Check that every rule is met
─────────────────────────────────────────────
All fifteen statements are satisfied by the completed table:

House 1: Norwegian Yellow Water Dunhill Cats  
House 2: Dane    Blue  Tea  Blends  Horse  
House 3: Brit    Red   Milk  Pall Mall Birds  
House 4: German  Green  Coffee Prince  Fish  
House 5: Swede   White  Beer  Bluemasters Dogs

16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

s = # snakes  
b = # birds  
m = # mammals  
i = # insects  
p = # spiders  

Remember that in each group there is exactly one “odd” animal:

• snake with 3 heads (2 extra heads)  
• bird with 2 heads (1 extra head)  
• mammal with 3 legs (1 leg short)  
• insect with 4 legs (2 legs short)  
• spider with 7 legs (1 leg short)

Heads  
Every animal normally has 1 head, plus the 3 extra heads above, so  
s + b + m + i + p + 3 = 100  ⇒ s + b + m + i + p = 97 (1)

Legs  
Snakes give 0 legs.  
Birds give 2b legs.  
Mammals give 4m − 1 legs.  
Insects give 6i − 2 legs.  
Spiders give 8p − 1 legs.  

2b + (4m − 1) + (6i − 2) + (8p − 1) = 376  
⇒ 2b + 4m + 6i + 8p = 380 (2)

Special conditions  
4) Insect legs = 2 × bird legs: 6i − 2 = 4b ⇒ b = (3i − 1)/2 (3)  
5) Snake heads = spider heads: s + 2 = p ⇒ p = s + 2 (4)

Insert p from (4) into (1):

s + b + m + i + (s + 2) = 97 ⇒ 2s + b + m + i = 95 (5)

Insert p from (4) into (2):

2b + 4m + 6i + 8(s + 2) = 380  
⇒ b + 2m + 3i + 4s = 182 (6)

Insert (3) into (5) and (6).  
From (6) and (5) one finds i − b = −8, hence i = b − 8.  
Combine with (3):  i = (3i − 1)/2 − 8 ⇒ i = 17 and b = 25.

Now (5) gives

2s + m = 53 (7)  
while (6) gives the same equation m + 2s = 53.  
So m = 53 − 2s.

Now apply the remaining conditions:

• All five quantities different.  
• Max − min = 10.

Try integer values for s (m must stay positive):

s  m=53−2s  p=s+2   set {s,p,m,17,25}   max−min

20,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

What's the middle sportsman's number?","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.
If d=2, the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 can be made into 1*8*9=3*4*6=72, and we can have c=9, e=4: 9*2*4=72.
If d=8, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 can be made into 1*4*9=2*3*6=36, but 36 is not divisible by 8.

Given  
a·b·c = c·d·e = e·f·g .               (∗)

From the first and the second equality we obtain  
a·b = d·e …………… (1)  
and from the second and the third equality  
c·d = f·g …………… (2)

So the middle number d must belong to two different products of two
other distinct digits.

Step 1.  Which numbers 1–9 can be written in TWO different ways as a
product of two distinct digits 1–9?  
Listing the possibilities gives

6 = 1·6 = 2·3  
8 = 1·8 = 2·4  
12 = 2·6 = 3·4  
18 = 2·9 = 3·6  
24 = 3·8 = 4·6  

No other integer ≤ 81 has this property.

Hence in (1) the common value a·b = d·e must be one of
6, 8, 12, 18, 24.  
In each case we try to place the four distinct digits
(a, b, d, e) and then look whether (2) can still be satisfied with the
three remaining unused digits.

Step 2.  Exhaustive check.

• Product 6 : {1, 6} and {2, 3}.  
 If d = 2 or 3, equation (2) cannot be fulfilled without repeating a
digit. No solution.

• Product 8 : {1, 8} and {2, 4}.  
 Taking d = 2, e = 4, a = 1, b = 8 we still have the digits
3, 6, 9 left.  
 Choose c = 9, then c·d = 9·2 = 18 and we can take f = 3, g = 6
(3·6 = 18).  
 This gives the row 1  8  9  2  4  3  6, which satisfies (∗).

 If d were 4, or if we exchanged the two pairs, (2) cannot be met.
 So product 8 works only with d = 2.

• Product 12 : {2, 6} and {3, 4}.  
 Trying all possibilities for d (2,3,4,6) leaves no way to satisfy (2)
with the remaining digits. No solution.

• Product 18 : {2, 9} and {3, 6}.  
 With d = 2, e = 9, a = 3, b = 6 the unused digits are 1, 4, 8.  
 Put c = 4, then c·d = 4·2 = 8 and take f = 1, g = 8
(1·8 = 8).  
 Row: 3  6  4  2  9  1  8 – condition (∗) holds.

 All other choices for d (3,6,9) fail.

• Product 24 : {3, 8} and {4, 6}.  
 None of the four possibilities for d satisfies (2). No solution.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  What can the last person (call him P10) transmit?  
    – He is allowed to utter exactly one of two words, “white” or “black”.  
    – Therefore he can convey at most one single binary bit of information to the other nine people.  

2.  Why can we not guarantee that all 10 survive?  
    – The unknown configuration of hats is a 10-bit string (each hat = 0 for black, 1 for white).  
    – Everybody except P10 sees at most 9 of those bits.  
    – Only one additional bit (the one word said by P10) can be added to what the others already see.  
    – A single bit is insufficient to distinguish all 10 possibilities for P10’s own hat colour, so P10 cannot be sure of saving himself.  
    – Hence, at best 9 of them can be saved with certainty, and that is the optimum we must aim for.

3.  A one-bit message that lets the other 9 deduce their own colours.  
    – The most familiar one-bit property of a set of binary digits is “parity”, i.e. whether the number of 1’s is even or odd.  
    – Plan: encode the parity of white hats P10 sees.  

4.  The convention agreed upon during the night  
    • “white” uttered by P10 means:  “The number of white hats I (P10) can see is EVEN.”  
    • “black” uttered by P10 means:  “The number of white hats I can see is ODD.”  
    (Any other fixed assignment of the two words to the two parities would work equally well; this one is just explicit.)

5.  How the daytime play proceeds  

    P10 (sees 9 hats).  
       – Counts the white hats in front of him.  
       – Announces “white” if that count is even, otherwise “black”.  
       – He survives with probability ½ (he does not know his own colour) but has now broadcast the parity bit.

    P9 (sees 8 hats).  
       – He has heard the announced parity and he sees the colours of P1–P8.  
       – Let W be the number of white hats he sees.  
       – If announced parity = “even” and W is even, then his own hat must be black; if announced parity = “even” and W is odd, his hat must be white.  
       – If announced parity = “odd”, reverse the conclusion.  
       – He says the deduced colour and is guaranteed to be correct.  
       – Before P8 is addressed, everyone still alive recomputes the new “running parity” by flipping it whenever someone just announced “white”.  (Operationally easier: Pk simply remembers what has already been said and what he still sees; the algebra works out.)

    P8, P7, … , P1 proceed identically:  
       – Each of them knows the original parity bit and has heard all answers between P10 and himself, so he can compute the parity of the unseen hats that still remain.  
       – Comparing that with what he actually sees, he infers his own colour with certainty.

6.  Verification by an example  

    Suppose the true hat line (from P10 at the back to P1 at the front) is  
          W  B  B  W  W  B  W  B  B  W  
          10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  

    • P10 sees eight whites?  Count = 5 whites (odd) → says “black” (odd parity).  
    • P9 hears “odd”, sees 4 whites (even) ⇒ must himself be white → says “white”, lives.  
    • P8 now knows current parity should be “odd XOR white‐said” = even, sees 3 whites (odd) ⇒ he is white → speaks, lives.  
      … and so on; everyone down to P1 determines the colour correctly.

7.  Optimality proof  

    • Because the first spoken word can carry only one bit of information, any deterministic protocol must leave P10 with at least two equally possible colours consistent with what he sees and the message he is constrained to give.  Therefore his survival probability can never exceed ½.  
    • Once P10’s word is fixed, the remaining nine people together see nine hats plus the one-bit message, i.e. the entire information needed to deduce their own colours uniquely.  So the above protocol, which indeed guarantees perfect knowledge for the remaining nine, is optimal.

Conclusion  
The best achievable strategy guarantees the survival of 9 out of the 10 islanders; the very last person in line survives with probability ½.  The concrete protocol is:

Last person: say “white” if you see an even number of white hats, “black” otherwise.  
Each subsequent person: knowing the original parity and what has been said so far, compare it with the parity of white hats you still see; speak the only colour that makes parities match.

Final answer: 9 people are guaranteed to live; the strategy is that the last person encodes the parity (even/odd) of white hats he sees with the word “white”/“black”, and everyone after him uses that bit together with what they observe to deduce and announce their own hat colour with certainty.",True
23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

24,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.
The names of BEAUTY's mom and aunt and that of the oldest black are immaterial. The same is true with the color of lucky.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"The only horse that can fit all the clues about last year’s Derby entry is the second brown horse.

•  There are exactly two brown horses on the farm.  
•  One of them is the 3-year-old colt BILLY (this year’s Derby hopeful).  
•  The other brown horse therefore must be older than three (otherwise there would be more than three 3-year-olds, contradicting the poem).  
•  A Kentucky-Derby runner must be exactly three; hence that older brown horse was three last year and four now.  
•  The poem says “their stallion’s loss last year was a pity,” so this older brown horse is a stallion.  
•  Among the remaining named horses the only one whose description has not yet been fixed is ROCKY, and ROCKY is also mentioned as slower than the three-year-olds, which fits a 4-year-old.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the required 10-digit number be  

  A B C D E F G H I J (each of 0-9 once).

Translate every clue.

1) A + D is a perfect square (∈ {0,1,4,9,16}).  
2) G + J is a triangular number (∈ {0,1,3,6,10,15}).  
3) B + I is even.  
4) E · F is odd  ⇒  E and F are distinct odd digits.  
5) C · H is prime  ⇒  one of C,H is 1 and the other is a prime digit (2,3,5,7).  
6) A / G = G / C  ⇒  A·C = G² (A,C,G are distinct digits; G ≠ 0).  
7) E + I = B + H.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Find all possibilities for (A,C,G).

Because A·C = G² ≤ 9·9 = 81, list squares ≤ 81 and factor them into two distinct digits:

      4  = 1·4  → (A,C,G) = (1,4,2) or (4,1,2)
      9  = 1·9  → (1,9,3) or (9,1,3)
      16 = 2·8  → (2,8,4) or (8,2,4)
      36 = 4·9  → (4,9,6) or (9,4,6)

So eight candidate triplets appear.

Step 2.  Use clue 5 (C·H prime).

• If C ≠ 1 the product cannot be prime, so only triplets with C = 1 survive.  
  That leaves  

  (A,C,G) = (4,1,2) or (9,1,3).

• One more possibility survives when C = 2 and H = 1 (because 2·1 = 2 is prime), i.e.  

  (A,C,G) = (8,2,4).

Hence three cases remain:

 A  C  G
1) 4  1  2
2) 9  1  3
3) 8  2  4

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Work each case.

CASE 1 A=4, C=1, G=2
• Clue 1: 4 + D is a square → D = 0 or 5.  
• Clue 2: 2 + J triangular → J = 8.  
• H must be a prime digit ≠ 2 (clue 5) → H = 3,5,7.  

Try D = 0  ⇒ remaining digits {3,5,6,7,9}.  After exhaustive check of
all ways to satisfy clues 3,4,7, no arrangement works.

Try D = 5  ⇒ remaining digits {0,3,6,7,9}.  
 • Let H = 3.  The only way to satisfy clues 3,4,7 is

  B = 6, E = 9, F = 7, I = 0.

 This gives the number 4 6 1 5 9 7 2 3 0 8.

 • H = 5 or 7 cannot satisfy the conditions.

Thus a complete solution is obtained: 4615972308.

CASE 2 A=9, C=1, G=3
Clue 1 gives D = 0 or 7; clue 2 then forces J = 7 or 0 respectively.
Either way not enough odd digits remain to have two distinct odds E,F,
so no solution here.

CASE 3 A=8, C=2, G=4
Clue 5 forces H = 1, but then clue 1 has no digit D that makes 8 + D a
square.  No solution.

Hence the single consistent arrangement is the one found in Case 1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Verification of 4615972308

A=4, B=6, C=1, D=5, E=9, F=7, G=2, H=3, I=0, J=8

1) 4+5 = 9  (square)  
2) 2+8 = 10 (triangular)  
3) 6+0 = 6  (even)  
4) 9·7 = 63 (odd)  
5) 1·3 = 3  (prime)  
6) 4/2 = 2  and 2/1 = 2

1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I

Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar

This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June

A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.

'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image.

1. Picture of a human brain  
   – The cerebral cortex is divided into four principal lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital.

2. Picture of Earth  
   – We commonly speak of the four seasons or of the “four corners of the earth”.

3. The incomplete phrase “Fair and ____”  
   – The only word that naturally completes it is “square”; a square possesses four equal sides (and four corners).

4. The letters AZ CO NM UT  
   – These are the U.S. postal abbreviations for Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, the only place in the United States where the borders of exactly four states meet (“the Four-Corners”).

5. A cheese sandwich with the crust perfectly cut off  
   – A slice of sandwich bread has four crust edges (four corners); cutting the crust off removes those four edges.

Each image, in its own way, points to the same idea: the number FOUR (or “four corners”).

With seven doors available, the door that “corresponded to the commonality of the images” must be the fourth door.

30,"A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler.  The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.
Suspect A:
1. C and I have met many times before today.
2. B is guilty.
3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Suspect B:

32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

34,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.

8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step  

Notation  
• N = number of blue–eyed islanders (unknown to the castaways, but in the real situation N = 100).  
• “Night k” means the k-th night after the guru’s announcement.  
• All islanders are perfect logicians and act only when absolutely certain.  
• The guru’s public sentence “I see a person with blue eyes” is heard by everybody and is known by everybody to be heard by everybody, etc.; thus it becomes common knowledge.

1. Why the guru’s sentence matters  
Before the announcement every islander already sees at least one blue-eyed person (unless he himself is the only one).  
However, that fact is not common knowledge: if I see a blue-eyed person I do not know whether the person I am looking at also sees a blue-eyed person.  
The guru’s statement changes this: now everyone knows that everybody knows that there is (at least) one blue-eyed person.

2. Base case: N = 1  
Suppose there were exactly one blue-eyed islander B.  
• B sees no blue eyes among the other 199 people.  
• The guru declares that she sees a blue-eyed person.  
• Hence B deduces that the only possible blue-eyed person is himself; he is now certain of his eye colour and leaves on Night 1.  
• Nobody else ever leaves (they are not certain of their own colour).

3. Induction step  
Assume the rule is true for every island with fewer than N blue-eyed people:  
“If there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave together on Night k.”

Now consider an island with N (≥2) blue-eyed people.  
Pick any blue-eyed islander X. X sees N–1 blue-eyed people around him.

X’s reasoning:  
a. “If my eyes were not blue, there would only be N–1 blue-eyed islanders.”  
b. “By the inductive hypothesis those N–1 people would then all leave on Night (N–1).”  
c. “If Night (N–1) passes with no one leaving, my assumption in (a) must be false; therefore my eyes are blue.”  

Every blue-eyed islander carries out exactly the same reasoning, so:

• If nobody leaves on Night 1, everybody (in particular every blue-eyed person) knows there cannot be exactly 1 blue-eyed person.  
• If nobody leaves on Night 2, everybody knows there cannot be exactly 2, etc.  
• After Night (N–1) passes empty, each blue-eyed islander becomes certain the true number is N and that he himself is one of them.  
• Therefore all N blue-eyed people step forward together on Night N and leave.  
• No brown-eyed (or any other-coloured) islander ever becomes certain of his own colour, so they stay forever.

4. Application to the given numbers  
The real island has N = 100 blue-eyed inhabitants.  
• Nights 1, 2, …, 99 pass with no one disembarking.  
• At sunset of Night 100 every blue-eyed islander is now absolutely sure his eyes are blue, and all 100 of them announce “My eyes are blue,” board the ship, and sail away.  
• The 100 brown-eyed islanders remain, forever uncertain of whether their eyes are brown, green, purple, etc.

Final answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night; everyone else stays.",True
38,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in full

1.  Let N be the largest number of throws we are willing to spend in the worst case.  
    •  With two balls, if the first ball is thrown from floor f1 and breaks, we may still have to make up to (f1–1) additional single–floor throws with the second ball; the total would be 1+(f1–1)=f1 throws.  
    •  If the first ball survives the first throw, we next try some higher floor f2.  If it now breaks we have already used 2 throws and may need at most (f2–f1–1) more single–floor throws.  The total in this branch must not exceed N, so  
                 (f2–f1–1)+2  ≤ N  ⇒  f2–f1 ≤ N–1.  
      Likewise every successive step must shorten the gap by one, otherwise one branch of the search tree would exceed N throws.

    Hence if the worst-case limit is N, the successive gaps between floors tried by the first ball must be
            N, (N–1), (N–2), … , 3, 2, 1
    and their sum must be at least the 100 floors that have to be covered:
            N+(N–1)+…+1 = N(N+1)/2  ≥ 100.

2.  Solve N(N+1)/2 ≥ 100.  
        N = 13  →  13·14/2 = 91  (too small)  
        N = 14  →  14·15/2 = 105  (just enough)  

    Therefore 14 throws are necessary and sufficient: no strategy can guarantee success in fewer, and there exists a strategy that never needs more than 14.

3.  Construct the required floors.

    Start with a gap of 14, then 13, then 12, … decreasing by one each time:

        1st throw: 14        (gap 14)
        2nd throw: 14+13 = 27   (gap 13)
        3rd throw: 27+12 = 39   (gap 12)
        4th throw: 39+11 = 50   (gap 11)
        5th throw: 50+10 = 60   (gap 10)
        6th throw: 60+ 9 = 69   (gap 9)
        7th throw: 69+ 8 = 77   (gap 8)
        8th throw: 77+ 7 = 84   (gap 7)
        9th throw: 84+ 6 = 90   (gap 6)
       10th throw: 90+ 5 = 95   (gap 5)
       11th throw: 95+ 4 = 99   (gap 4)
       12th throw: 99+ 3 = 102  (>100)

    We stop at floor 100 instead of 102; that last gap is only 1, which is allowed because we have already covered all 100 floors.

    So the list of test floors is
        14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

4.  Why it works.

    •  If the first ball breaks on the k-th throw, there have been (k–1) throws so far and the gap that has just failed is (14–k+1).  
    •  We then linearly test at most that many floors with the second ball.  
    •  Total throws in that branch = (k–1) + 1 + (14–k) = 14.

    No branch uses more than 14 throws, so the worst-case number of trials is 14, which is optimal.

Order of floors to drop from (stop as soon as the first ball breaks):
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

With this schedule the highest safe floor will always be found in at most 14 drops, and no strategy can guarantee doing better with only two balls.",True

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  
R = the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves,  
B = 100 – R = the number of blue-hatted dwarves.  
We are told 1 ≤ R ≤ 99, and every dwarf is perfectly logical.

Key facts every dwarf knows (and knows that the others know, etc.)  
1. Every night all 100 dwarves see the other 99 hats.  
2. It is forbidden to talk about hat colours.  
3. There is **at least one red and at least one blue hat**.  
4. A dwarf who can deduce that his own hat is red must stay away from the very next feast and never return.

We prove by induction on R how many nights elapse before the red-hatted dwarves stop coming.

-------------------------------------------------
Base case R = 1  
The single red dwarf sees 0 red hats.  
Because everybody knows there is at least one red hat, he alone can conclude, on the very first night, “I must be the red one.”  
He therefore stays home the next night.  
So all red hats disappear after 1 day.

-------------------------------------------------
Induction step  
Assume for some k ≥ 1:  
“If exactly k red hats are present, then they all leave after k nights.”

Now suppose there are k + 1 red hats.

Each red-hatted dwarf sees k red hats.  
He reasons: “If my own hat were blue, then there would be exactly k red hats. By the induction hypothesis those k dwarves would all leave after k nights. So if I attend the feast on the (k + 1)-st night and still see every one of those k red dwarves present, I will know my assumption was wrong and my own hat must be red.”

Exactly that happens: during the first k nights no one leaves (each is still unsure); on the (k + 1)-st night every red dwarf still sees the k others and therefore realises he, too, is red. Consequently all k + 1 reds stay home the next night and never return.

Hence, if there are k + 1 red hats, they disappear after k + 1 nights, completing the induction.

-------------------------------------------------
Conclusion  
If there are R red-hatted dwarves, they will all stay away starting on the (R + 1)-st feast; equivalently, it takes exactly R days before there are no red hats at the party.

Because the total population is 100 with at least one blue hat, R can be at most 99, so the number of days required is some integer R between 1 and 99 — precisely equal to the actual number of red-hatted dwarves.

Final answer: After exactly as many days as there are red-hatted dwarves (at most 99), no red-hatted dwarf will attend the feast.",True

5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four adjacent booths be numbered 1 – 4 from left to right.  
For every ambassador we note whether he is

 T = tentacled  S = slimy  G = green.

Exactly one alien is simultaneously G, T and S – this is the Neptunian assassin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Putting Agurgle

Clue 2 says Agurgle is in a booth that has two neighbours, each of which is
NOT green.  
Therefore Agurgle must be in one of the two middle booths (2 or 3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Using the “tentacled” clue

Clue 1: “Wym-Inar is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly
ONE tentacled alien.”

Put Wym-Inar at the left-hand end (booth 1).  
Then the booth next to him (booth 2) must be tentacled, because Wym-Inar
has to be next to exactly one tentacled alien.

Now work rightwards:

•  If booth 2 is the only tentacled neighbour of Wym-Inar, the alien in
booth 4 must **also** be tentacled; otherwise the alien in booth 3 would be
next to exactly one tentacled neighbour, contradicting the fact that
only Wym-Inar enjoys that property.

Thus the pattern of “T / not-T” is

 booth 1 booth 2 booth 3 booth 4  
    –     T    –     T

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Placing the names

Because booth 2 or 3 must hold Agurgle, and booth 1 already holds
Wym-Inar, two possible line-ups remain:

 (A) 1 Wym-Inar  2 Agurgle  3 ChimChim  4 Mr Johnson  
 (B) 1 Wym-Inar  2 Agurgle  3 Mr Johnson 4 ChimChim

Case (A) will fail (see below), case (B) will work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Working with the “slimy” clue – Case (A) fails

Clue 3: “ChimChim is the only ambassador NOT in a booth next to exactly
one un-slimy alien.”

In line-up (A) ChimChim is in booth 3.
Let S = 1 mean “slimy”.

•  For Wym-Inar (booth 1) to be next to exactly one un-slimy,
Agurgle (booth 2) must be un-slimy ⇒ S₂ = 0.

•  ChimChim (booth 3) would then have one neighbour un-slimy
(Agurgle) and one neighbour whose sliminess we shall see is slimy,
so ChimChim would be next to exactly **one** un-slimy alien – forbidden.
Hence line-up (A) is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Working with line-up (B)

Line-up (B): 1 Wym-Inar 2 Agurgle 3 Mr Johnson 4 ChimChim  
(T-pattern – T – T stays as before.)

Let us assign sliminess.

(i)  Wym-Inar (booth 1) has only neighbour Agurgle.
    For Wym-Inar to be next to **exactly one** un-slimy alien,
    Agurgle must be un-slimy  
    ⇒ S₂ = 0.

(ii) Mr Johnson (booth 3) is not ChimChim, so he too must be next to
     exactly one un-slimy neighbour.
     His neighbours are Agurgle (unslimy) and ChimChim (unknown).  
     This will be satisfied iff ChimChim is slimy  
     ⇒ S₄ = 1.

(iii) With S₄ = 1, ChimChim (booth 4) has **zero**
      un-slimy neighbours (his only neighbour, Johnson, is slimy).  
      ChimChim is therefore the unique ambassador **not** next to
      exactly one un-slimy alien – precisely what Clue 3 requires.

(iv) Finally Agurgle (booth 2) now has neighbours
     Wym-Inar (unslimy) and Johnson (slimy) – exactly one un-slimy neighbour.
     Clue 3 is satisfied for everyone.

So the slimy pattern is

 booth 1 booth 2 booth 3 booth 4  
   S=0   S=0   S=1   S=1

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  The assassin

Only the aliens in booths 2 and 4 are tentacled.
Of those, only booth 4’s occupant (ChimChim)

 • is tentacled (T = 1)  
 • is slimy  (S = 1)

Make him green as well (nothing forbids this – his only neighbours have
already been declared non-green by Clue 2) and he is the sole
green-tentacled-slimy creature, i.e. the Neptunian assassin.

All three clues and all conditions are now met.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NASA therefore keep the door of booth 4 shut – the assassin is

ChimChim from Pluto.

D1 D2 D3 D4 D5

Run one race in each lane-group (5 races).  
Inside each heat we now know the complete order

A1<A2<A3<A4<A5, … , E1<E2<E3<E4<E5.

Step 2 – race the five heat-winners (race 6)  
Race A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 together.  
Suppose the order of this “final” is

A1 < B1 < C1 < D1 < E1.      (If another order occurs just relabel the heats;
                                 the argument is identical.)

What we already know

• Any horse in heats D or E is slower than D1 or E1, which are already
  beaten by three other horses, so none of them can be in the overall top 3.  
  ⇒ throw away 10 horses.

• Inside heat C, horses C2,C3,… are all slower than C1 which is already
  beaten by A1 and B1, so C2 and C3 cannot reach the top 3 either.  
  ⇒ discard C2,C3,C4,C5.

• Inside heat B, horse B3 is slower than B2<B1, and the top two places are
  already occupied by A1 and at least one of A2/A3/B1, so B3 cannot reach
  the podium.  
  ⇒ discard B3,B4,B5.

After these eliminations only six animals can still be in the first three
overall:

A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.

(The track has only five lanes, but A1 is already known to be the fastest of
all – it beat everyone in its heat and all other heat-winners.  
So we can leave A1 standing and race the other five.)

Step 3 – the last race (race 7)  
Race the five remaining candidates

A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , C1.

Whatever the order in this race, combine it with the inequalities already
known:

• A1 beats everybody,  
• B1 beats C1 (from race 6),  
• A2 beats A3 (heat A),  
• B1 beats B2 (heat B).

From these data we can read off the overall second- and third-place horses.
Thus after the 7th race the complete podium is fixed.

Why 7 races are unavoidable  
After the sixth race the relative order between A2, A3, B1, B2 and C1 is
still totally unknown; any of those five could still be second or third.
Because only five horses can be compared in one race you need at least one
more race, so no scheme can succeed in fewer than 7 races.

50,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.

5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.

11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"All the brother needs is the fact that a big saw keeps turning for quite a while after the current is cut: the sooner the current is cut, the longer the blade has been slowing down when he next looks at it, and therefore the slower (or more completely stopped) it will be.

1. While he is still in the sawing room the brother touches nothing; he merely notes that every machine is running.

2. He leaves the room and shuts the door.  
   Outside he now works only on the five back-up switches and keeps careful track of the time.

   • At time t = 0 he throws one of the back-up switches to OFF.  
   • Exactly one minute later he throws a second back-up switch to OFF.  
   • One minute later he throws a third switch to OFF,  
   • after another minute a fourth switch to OFF,  
   • and, after the fourth interval, he throws the last switch to OFF.

   (Any convenient equal interval – half-minutes, whole minutes, etc. – will do; the only requirement is that all intervals be the same and that, during the whole operation, the brother remembers the order in which he opened the five switches.)

3. The moment the fifth switch has been opened he re-enters the machine room.

   Because a saw’s blade has a large moment of inertia, the five machines are now in five distinctly different states:

   • the machine whose current was cut first has had the longest time to slow down and will be completely stopped (or almost so);  
   • the machine cut second will be turning very slowly;  
   • the machine cut third a little faster;  
   • the machine cut fourth still faster;  
   • and the machine whose current was cut last will be spinning almost at full speed.

4. By simply ranking the machines from “stopped” through “fastest”, the brother knows in exactly what order their power was removed.  
   He already knows in what order he opened the back-up switches, so he can pair each machine with the correct outside switch.

5. He can now walk back into the corridor and label (or otherwise identify) every back-up switch with the machine it controls, having learned the correspondence solely by operating the switches and making one final inspection of the machines.

Final answer: he turns the five outside switches OFF one after another at equal time intervals, immediately goes back inside, and matches the machines’ different degrees of run-down (from stopped to almost full speed) to the order in which he opened the switches; this uniquely identifies which outside switch belongs to which machine.",True

Position 5 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 7 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 11 - Chris Mass
From clue (3), the only possible positions for Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are Position 2 and Position 10.
Now there are 3 positions remaining - 6, 8 and 9 and remaining 3 suspects are Hugo Phurst, Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick. But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.
Suspects from left to right are: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass.
Thus,
Diddy Dewit (1), Ewan Watarmy (4), Hugo Phurst (6), Lou Stooth (7) and Chris Mass (11) are the suspects whose positions are fixed.
Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are at position 2 or 10.
Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants are at position 3 or 5.
Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick are at position 8 or 9.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We label the 11 places in the line-up 1 (far left) to 11 (far right); the centre place is 6, where the main culprit (MC) must stand.

We translate each clue into position conditions:

1. Barb and Chris are >6.  
2. Exactly two between Ewan and Lou  ⇒ |E−L| = 3.  
3. Seven between Mike and Phil ⇒ |M−P| = 8 → only pairs (1,9), (2,10), (3,11).  
4. Gerry is to the right of Hugo.  
5. Robin and Polly are on opposite sides of Ewan.  
6. Diddy and Polly are <6.  
7. Six between Chris and Ewan ⇒ |C−E| = 7 → possible pairs (1,8), (2,9), (3,10), (4,11) with Chris on the right member (because Chris>6).  
8. Two between Ewan and Diddy ⇒ |E−D| = 3.

Trying each Chris/Ewan pair:

• (C=8,E=1) fails (Lou would coincide with Diddy).  
• (C=9,E=2) fails (Lou coincides with Diddy).  
• (C=10,E=3) fails (Diddy would be at 6 which is not “left of” MC).  
• (C=11,E=4) survives all distance rules:

 Ewan = 4, Chris = 11  
 Diddy must be 1 (distance 3 from Ewan and left of MC).  
 Lou must be 7 (distance 3 from Ewan, not conflicting with Diddy).  
 To satisfy clue 3 we choose Mike = 2 and Phil = 10 (distance 8).  
 Barb (right of MC) can go to 8 or 9; pick Barb = 8.  
 Robin and Polly must be on opposite sides of Ewan and Polly <6.  
 Choose Polly = 3 (left of Ewan) and Robin = 5 (right of Ewan).  
 Remaining unplaced names: Hugo and Gerry with Gerry right of Hugo; places left are 6 and 9.  
 Put Hugo = 6 (the centre) and Gerry = 9.

Line-up now is  
1 Diddy, 2 Mike, 3 Polly, 4 Ewan, 5 Robin, 6 Hugo, 7 Lou, 8 Barb, 9 Gerry, 10 Phil, 11 Chris.

Every clue checks out perfectly, so the person in the centre, position 6, is Hugo Phurst.

If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Every time a boat negotiates the whole flight the water that was in the top lock ends up in the river at the bottom.  
Loss of water from the summit per passage

 • Capacity of one lock = 7 000 L = 7 t  
 • Number of locks in the flight = 13  
 • Water lost per passage = 13 × 7 000 L = 91 000 L ≈ 91 t

Water that a hired road-tanker can bring up

 • Truck capacity = 22 t = 22 000 L

Number of loads that have to be hauled up for every single boat

 91 t ÷ 22 t ≈ 4.1  → 5 full tanker-loads

Thus, for just one boat the lorry must climb the hill five times; two boats would need ten trips, and a modest pleasure-boat traffic of, say, ten boats a day would require about fifty tanker journeys a day.  That is clearly impractical as a day-to-day way of keeping the summit pound in water and would cost far more than installing a small pump or providing a proper water feed.

Therefore the proposed contract to keep the canal supplied by carting water up the hill in a 22-ton truck is not reasonable.",True

5. X is a square number.

Which statements are true?","All of the statements involve X in them, but some of the statements give direct information about whether they're true or not, and also potential hints for X.","If X is 2, then statements 2 and 3 create a paradox. Therefore, X is not 2, so statements 2 and 3 are both true because the ""if"" part is not satisfied.
Therefore, statement 6 must be true, because if X is less than 3, we know X must be 2. In this case, statement 5 is false.
However, because statement 6 is true, there are at least 3 true statements, meaning we can't conclude if statement 5 is false based on this statement alone.
Statement 7 is false because X is definitely greater than 2, and the previous statement was true.
Statement 1 and 4 must be false, because their truth will imply their falseness.
For example, if statement 4 was true, then it won't be satisfied anymore (as there are at least 4 statements true), so it can't be true.
But statement 5 must then be true, else statements 1 and 4 will become true.
Conveniently, X is 4, and is a square number, as statement 5 implies.
Therefore, statements 2, 3, 5, 6 are true.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let us label the sentences

(0)  “X statements below are true.”          (the un-numbered first line)  
(1)  “X is 3.”  
(2)  “If X is 2, then the following statement is false.”  
(3)  “If X is 2, then the previous statement is true.”  
(4)  “X is less than 4.”  
(5)  “X is a square number.”  
(6)  “If X is less than 3, then the previous statement is false.”  
(7)  “If X is greater than 2, then the previous statement is false.”

Our job is to find a value of X and a truth-value for each sentence so that every sentence has a definite (classical) truth value.  
Let Tₖ denote “statement (k) is true”.

1.  Consequences of X ≠ 2  
    • If X ≠ 2, the antecedent “X is 2” in (2) and (3) is false, so both implications are automatically true:  
      T₂ = T₃ = true.

    • If X = 2, the two implications give the system  
         T₂ = ¬T₃ and T₃ = T₂,  
      which forces T₃ = ¬T₃, an impossibility.  
      Therefore X cannot be 2.

    So from now on we know X ≠ 2 and hence T₂ = T₃ = true.

2.  Remaining sentences as functions of X  
    T₁ = (X = 3).  
    T₄ = (X < 4).  
    T₅ = (X is a perfect square).  
    T₆ = true, except that if X < 3 then it is true only when T₅ is false.  
    T₇ = true when X ≤ 2; when X > 2 it equals ¬T₆.

3.  Trial of possible X’s  
    We must have 0 ≤ X ≤ 7, because only seven numbered statements can be true.

    • X = 0,1,3 give five true statements below line 0, contradicting (0).  
    • X ≥ 5 and not a square give three true statements below line 0, contradicting (0).  
    • X ≥ 5 and a square (9, 16, …) give four true statements below line 0, contradicting (0).

    • X = 4 (note that 4 is a square) yields:

         T₁ : false                (4 ≠ 3)  
         T₂ : true                 (see section 1)  
         T₃ : true                 (see section 1)  
         T₄ : false                (4 < 4 is false)  
         T₅ : true                 (4 is a square)  
         T₆ : true                 (antecedent “X<3” is false)  
         T₇ : false                (X>2 is true but ¬T₆ is false)

      Exactly four of the seven numbered statements are true (namely 2,3,5,6), so sentence (0) is itself true: “4 statements below are true.”

4.  Uniqueness  
    We have already seen that any other value of X makes (0) false, so the assignment X = 4 is the only consistent one.

Thus the full, consistent truth assignment is

True  : statements 0, 2, 3, 5, 6  
False : statements 1, 4, 7.

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉ d₁₀.

Translate every clue:

1. All digits 0–9 are used once.  

2. d₃ + d₄ = d₆ · d₉.                      (1)  
3. d₅ · d₁₀ is odd  ⇒  d₅, d₁₀ are odd.     (2)  
4. d₂ > d₅ > d₇.                            (3)  
5. d₈ > d₆ > d₂.                            (4)  
6. d₂ + d₆ + d₉ is a perfect square.        (5)  
7. d₄ + d₉ = d₁₀.                           (6)  
8. d₁ + d₅ = d₇ + d₁₀.                      (7)  
9. d₉ is even.                              (8)

Step 1 – Use parity facts  
• (2) ⇒ d₅, d₁₀ are odd.  
• (6) with (8): d₄ = d₁₀ – d₉.  d₁₀ odd, d₉ even ⇒ d₄ odd.  
• (1) requires d₃ + d₄ even.  Since d₄ is odd, d₃ must be odd.  

Thus four of the five odd digits {1,3,5,7,9} sit at positions 3,4,5,10.  
Therefore exactly one of the remaining positions {1,2,6,7,8,9} is odd.  
But d₉ is even, so the single remaining odd digit is in {2,6,8}.  

Step 2 – Restrict d₆ and d₉ via (1)  
d₃ + d₄ is the sum of two odd digits ⇒ it can be 4,6,8,10,12,14,16.  
Hence d₆ · d₉ ≤ 16.  With d₉ ∈ {2,4,6,8} (cannot be 0), the feasible pairs are  
(d₆,d₉) ∈ { (3,4), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (2,8), (2,6), (2,4), (1,8), (1,6), (1,4) }.  
Because of the chain d₈ > d₆ > d₂ > d₅ > d₇, d₆ must exceed 2, so discard pairs with d₆ = 1 or 2.  
Remaining possibilities:

a) (d₆,d₉) = (3,4)  (product 12)  
b) (d₆,d₉) = (3,2)  (product 6)  
c) (d₆,d₉) = (4,2)  (product 8)  
d) (d₆,d₉) = (5,2)  (product 10)  
e) (d₆,d₉) = (6,2)  (product 12)  
f) (d₆,d₉) = (7,2)  (product 14)

Step 3 – Try the possibilities and test the other rules  

Case (b) (d₆,d₉) = (3,2) fails because (5) gives d₂ + 3 + 2 = 7, not a square.  

Case (a) (d₆,d₉) = (3,4) works beautifully:  
• (1) demands d₃ + d₄ = 12.  The only way with distinct odd digits is 5 + 7 or 7 + 5.  
  Choose d₃ = 7, d₄ = 5 so that (6) produces an in-range digit: d₁₀ = d₄ + d₉ = 5 + 4 = 9.  
• (3) now forces d₅ odd and less than d₂; let d₅ = 1 (smallest remaining odd).  
  Then (3) with d₆ = 3 dictates d₂ = 2 and d₇ = 0.  
• Check (5): d₂ + d₆ + d₉ = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, a perfect square.  
• (7) requires d₁ + d₅ = d₇ + d₁₀ ⇒ d₁ + 1 = 0 + 9 ⇒ d₁ = 8.  
• The only unused digit now is 6, which fits (4) as d₈ (since 6 > 3 > 2).  

All digits 0-9 are now placed uniquely:

Position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
Digit    : 8 2 7 5 1 3 0 6 4 9

Step 4 – Final verification  
(1) 7 + 5 = 12 and 3 × 4 = 12 ✓  
(2) 1 × 9 = 9 (odd) ✓  
(3) 2 > 1 > 0 ✓  
(4) 6 > 3 > 2 ✓  
(5) 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (square) ✓  
(6) 5 + 4 = 9 ✓

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Company B did not really give the Emperor three different prices for exactly the same job; he gave him three prices for three very different kinds of job.  
What was different was not the bridge (it would be identical in every case) but the **speed** with which the bridge would be finished – and, therefore, the value that finishing it early would have for the country.

What the contractor told the Emperor (in substance) was this:

• “If you want the bridge finished **in six months**, I will have to put every crew I have on the site, hire extra men, fly in equipment and materials, and pay very large overtime premiums.  I can do it, but it will cost you **$1 000 000**.

• “If you are willing to wait **about a year**, I can schedule the job in with other work I already have, use the men and machinery that will be free by then, and avoid most of the overtime.  Done that way the bridge will cost **$750 000**.

• “If you really do not care how long it takes and are content to have the bridge sometime in the next **two-to-three years**, I can work on it only when I have idle capacity and left-over materials from other jobs.  Under those conditions I could build it for **$200 000**.

“Put the three figures in the contract.  
When the bridge is finished you, and only you, will decide which completion date you wanted and pay the corresponding price.”

The moment the Emperor heard the explanation he accepted the offer and told the contractor to start at once on the six-month schedule.  

Why?  
Because the Emperor’s main aim was to revitalise the islands quickly, attract tourists and new residents, and stop the population from shrinking.  Every extra month without the bridge would cost the country far more than the extra construction cost in lost tourist revenue and lost opportunities.

58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

n = number of friends  (1 < n < 10)  
T = total number of Golden kebab tokens  

1.  Two pairs of sisters  
   – 4 friends belong to the two sister-pairs.  
   – The remaining n − 4 friends are unrelated single–member families.  
   Therefore the number of families is  

  F = 2 (the two sister families) + (n − 4) = n − 2.

2.  “Tokens per family are 5 more than tokens per friend”  

  T /(n − 2) = T /n + 5  
 ⇒  T [ 1/(n − 2) – 1/n ] = 5  
 ⇒  T · 2 /[n(n − 2)] = 5  
 ⇒  T = 5 n(n − 2) / 2.                      (★)

   For T to be an integer, n(n − 2) must be even ⇒ n must be even.  
   With n < 10 and ≥ 4 (we need 4 sisters) the even possibilities are n = 4, 6, 8.

   • n = 4 Impossible, because all four would be sisters and Norha Bone is not in either pair.  
   • n = 6 gives T = 5·6·4 /2 = 60.  
   • n = 8 gives T = 5·8·6 /2 = 120.

3.  Wendy gives up her share  
   – Each friend originally received T /n tokens.  
   – Wendy’s share T /n must be divisible by the remaining n − 1 friends, because it is redistributed whole.

   Check divisibility:

   • n = 6 T /n = 60/6 = 10,  10 divisible by 5 → OK.  
   • n = 8 T /n = 120/8 = 15,  15 divisible by 7 → NO.

   Hence the only feasible value is n = 6.

4.  Final distribution when n = 6  
   Initial share per friend = 60 / 6 = 10 tokens.  
   Wendy’s 10 tokens split among the other 5 friends → each of them gets 10/5 = 2 extra.  
   Therefore each of the remaining five friends finishes with 10 + 2 = 12 tokens,  
   while Wendy keeps none.

Final answer: 6 friends in all; after Wendy renounced her share, the other five friends ended up with 12 Golden kebab tokens each (Wendy received none).",True

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field
-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.
The shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"From the clues we can reconstruct (one possible) map of the gardens and their adjacencies.  
The key steps are:

•  Quack’s house borders only Duck Country and The Forest (clue 7).  
•  Hence the shortest Kuakk → Quack route is  
  Kvakk – X – Duck Country – Quack (clues 1 & 5, with X ≠ Field, Forest, Angel’s Valley or Star).  

•  The shortest Quack → Flower-heaven route is  
  Quack – Forest – Angel’s Valley – Flower-heaven (clues 9 & 16).

•  Flower-heaven is therefore adjacent to The Mountain (clue 4), to Angel’s Valley (clue 16) and to exactly one further garden (clue 13).  
  That third neighbour has to be a garden that is adjacent to The Field, because “there is one garden between The Field and Flower-heaven’’ (clue 3).  
  From clue 8 The Field touches six gardens: the Lawn, Longo, the Pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk’s house.  
  Of these only the Pool can be chosen without breaking any other clause, so

        The Pool is the third and last garden that borders Flower-heaven.

•  We already know from clue 4 that the Pool borders Kvakk’s house.

Putting the last two bullets together gives the shortest possible connection:

    Kvakk’s house  –  The Pool  –  Flower-heaven.

That path contains only one intervening garden, and no shorter path is possible because Flower-heaven does not border Kvakk’s house directly.

Final answer: The dog should go from Kvakk’s house into The Pool and from there straight into Flower-heaven.",True
61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.

When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

Try every assignment of the three periods {2,3,7} to (Edgar, Frank, George) together with all possible first-visit day-numbers (they must be the earliest numbers ≤ period length that give the stated weekdays).

The only assignment that fulfils the weekday requirements

 • Edgar’s first visit Monday  
 • Frank’s first visit Wednesday  
 • George’s first visit Friday  

is:

 Edgar – every 7 days, first visit day 6

Step 4.  Check uniqueness

For any possible month length (28, 29, 30, 31 days) day 27 lies inside the month, and no later common day (34, 41, …) is inside the month, so there is exactly one such day, as required.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.

We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

68,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = AD
2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5
4) B * I = AJ","The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.","2951804637
A = 2, B = 9, C = 5, D = 1, E = 8, F = 0, G = 4, H = 6, I = 3, J = 7
1) 9 + 5 + 0 + 7 = 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 21
2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.
H) The last four letters can now be assigned values.  D = 1, E = 8, G = 4, and H = 6.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning steps

1.  Let the digits be A B C D E F G H I J (all different, A≠0).

2.  Translate the clues.

   •  B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = 10A + D          (since AD is the two-digit number with tens A, units D)  
   •  B – H = J – G = 3                                (so B = H+3, J = G+3)  
   •  C – F = E – I = 5                                (so C = F+5, E = I+5)  
   •  B·I = 10A + J                                    (since AJ is the two-digit product)

3.  Substitute the differences into the equal sums:

     B + C + F + J = (H+3) + (F+5) + F + (G+3)  
                   = H + G + 2F + 11

     E + G + H + I = (I+5) + G + H + I  
                   = H + G + 2I + 5

     These must be equal, so

          H + G + 2F + 11 = H + G + 2I + 5
          ⇒  2F + 11 = 2I + 5
          ⇒  F – I = –3
          ⇒  I = F + 3

4.  From the earlier relations we now have

     C = F + 5, I = F + 3, E = F + 8.

     Since each is a digit 0-9, F can only be 0 or 1 (because F+8 ≤ 9).

5.  Case F = 0.

     Then C=5, I=3, E=8.

     B = H+3, J = G+3 with all digits still unused.

     (a)  Take H = 6  (then B = 9).  
          Choose G = 4 (then J = 7) – all digits so far are distinct.  

          Check the product clue:  B·I = 9·3 = 27, so 10A+J = 27 ⇒ A=2, J=7.  
          This matches the chosen J, so the set is consistent.

          The common sum is
              H + G + 2F + 11 = 6 + 4 + 0 + 11 = 21,
          so D = 1.

          Digits obtained:  A=2, B=9, C=5, D=1, E=8, F=0, G=4, H=6, I=3, J=7  
          – exactly the ten different digits 0–9.

     (b)  All other choices for H or G under F=0 fail; F=1 yields no solution at all.

6.  Therefore the unique ten-digit number is

        2 9 5 1 8 0 4 6 3 7.

A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.

Every question we ask is a YES/NO question.

QUESTION 1 (to Alex) :  “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”  
QUESTION 2 (to Alex) :  “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”      (exactly the same question)

Analyse Alex’s two answers.

• If his two answers are different, Alex must be the alternating man (only the alternator can change his truth-value between two identical questions).  
• If the two answers are identical, Alex is one of the consistent men (either the truth-teller or the liar).    
  – Two identical YESes mean Alex is the truth-teller.  
  – Two identical NOs mean Alex is the liar.  

We now decide what to do with our third and last question.

------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1 :  Alex is the alternator  (his two answers differed)

The other two men are the truth-teller and the liar.  
Ask

QUESTION 3 (to Bob) :  “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”

Because Bob is now known to be consistent, his answer tells us who he is:

• YES  ⇒  Bob tells the truth  ⇒  Bob = truth-teller, Chuck = liar.  
• NO   ⇒  Bob lies            ⇒  Bob = liar,           Chuck = truth-teller.

------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 2 :  Alex is consistent  (his two answers were the same)

So Alex is already identified (truth-teller if he twice said YES, liar if he twice said NO).  
Exactly one of Bob or Chuck is the alternator; the other is the remaining consistent man.  
Ask Alex the following mixed question:

QUESTION 3 (to Alex) :  
     “Is Bob the alternator if and only if you are the truth-teller ?”

Let P be the statement “Bob is the alternator” and R be “Alex is the truth-teller”.  
The question we asked is “P ↔ R”.

• If Alex really is the truth-teller (R is true), the biconditional reduces to P,  
  so Alex answers YES exactly when Bob is the alternator.  

• If Alex is the liar (R is false), the biconditional is equivalent to ¬P.  
  The liar negates this and therefore still answers YES exactly when Bob is the alternator.  

Thus Alex’s third answer is interpreted the same way no matter whether he is the truth-teller or the liar:

• YES  ⇒  Bob = alternator,       Chuck = (whichever consistent role is still unused).  
• NO   ⇒  Bob = remaining consistent man,  Chuck = alternator.

------------------------------------------------------------------
In every possible scenario the three questions classify all three men.

Final answer:  Yes.  Ask Alex “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?” twice; if the answers differ he is the alternator and Bob’s answer to “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?” shows which of Bob and Chuck is the truth-teller and which the liar.  If Alex’s two answers are the same he is the truth-teller (two YESes) or the liar (two NOs); then ask Alex “Is Bob the alternator iff you are the truth-teller ?”.  His reply identifies whether Bob or Chuck is the alternator, completing the classification.",True

76,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let t be the number of minutes that have elapsed since the faulty clock was started in the 6 o’clock position.

1. Real (correct) hand speeds  
   • Real minute hand: 360° per hour = 6° per minute  
   • Real hour hand   : 30° per hour = 0.5° per minute  

2. Faulty clock speeds (because the hands were interchanged)  
   • Visible “hour” hand (the short one) is on the fast spindle: 6° per minute  
   • Visible “minute” hand (the long one) is on the slow spindle: 0.5° per minute  

3. Initial positions at t = 0  
   • Visible hour hand: 180° (pointing at 6)  
   • Visible minute hand:   0° (pointing at 12)  

4. Positions after t minutes  
   Faulty clock:  
     θ_h(t) = 180° + 6t      (visible hour hand)  
     θ_m(t) =   0° + 0.5t    (visible minute hand)  

   Correct clock (what the hands ought to show):  
     θ_h _real(t) = 180° + 0.5t  
     θ_m _real(t) = 6t  

5. For the clock to show the right time we need both hands in their correct places:

   θ_h(t) ≡ θ_h _real(t) (mod 360°)  
   θ_m(t) ≡ θ_m _real(t) (mod 360°)

   These give
      180 + 6t ≡ 180 + 0.5t (mod 360) ⇒ 5.5t ≡ 0 (mod 360)  
        0.5t  ≡ 6t        (mod 360) ⇒ 5.5t ≡ 0 (mod 360)

   Thus 5.5t must be a multiple of 360°, so the smallest positive t is

         t = 360° / 5.5° per min = 720/11 min
           = 65 5⁄11 min
           = 1 h 5 min 27 3⁄11 s.

6. Therefore, the first time after the start when the clock reads correctly is

   6 : 00 00 + 1 h 5 min 27 3⁄11 s = 7 : 05 27 3⁄11.

8-point throws  
• 5 3 2 1 6 → occurrences 1-1-1-1-1 (no duplicates)  
• 2 2 3 5 1 → occurrences 2-1-1-1 (one single pair)

• 1 2 6 6 6 → occurrences 3-1-1 (three-of-a-kind)  
• 2 2 5 6 6 → occurrences 2-2-1 (two different pairs)

So the rule that fits all the data is:

• If the throw contains at most one duplicated value – i.e. the dice show five different faces or one single pair – you score 8 points.  
• If it contains heavier duplication – two different pairs, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind or five-of-a-kind – you score 6 points.

Now evaluate the new throw 4 3 6 2 6.

Counts: 6 appears twice, the other three faces appear once each.  
That is exactly one pair and no other duplication, so it falls in the “single-pair / mostly different” category.

Therefore it scores 8 points.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?","Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
So now, knowing that the killer's sister is COUSIN to Bo, Bill's NIECE, and Bob's GRANDDAUGHTER, the killer must be BERNIE.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We can reconstruct the Beem family from the clues.

1.  Mary’s husband is Bob (he is “Grandfather Bob”).  
2.  They have exactly four children (Mary was “mother of four”):
   • May – married to Ben  
   • Robin – married to Mo  
   • Maria – married to Barry  
   • Bill – not married into the family, therefore a blood son

   The four spouses give the four couples required in the note.

3.  Grandchildren (nine in all) distribute to the four couples as follows, satisfying every clue.
   • May & Ben → Missy, Bernie  
   • Robin & Mo → Bart, Buck, Bruce  
   • Maria & Barry → Bo, Molly  
   • Bill & ( wife ) Myra → Brad, Megan  

   All relationships mentioned (brothers Bart-Buck-Bruce, siblings Bo-Molly, cousin relations, etc.) are now correct, and Bill’s brother-in-law is Barry, exactly as Clue 1 states.

4.  Now consider the key statement:  
   “The killer’s sister … talked to her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her blood-uncle Bill.”

   • A granddaughter whose cousin is Bo cannot be Molly (Bo is her brother), cannot be Megan (Bill would be her father, not uncle), and can only be Missy.

86,"During one meeting with a clan of ninjas, it has been noticed that more ninjas have turned up to the meeting than usual. The ninjas realised that these infiltrators must be the enemy of the ninjas (the pirates). Each person dressed as a ninja at the meeting made a statement. The cunning ninjas lied about their fellow ninjas in order to remain secret and told the truth about the pirates. The pirates tried to mock the cunningness by lying about the pirates and telling the truth about the ninjas. From the following statements, can you identify the ninjas and pirates?
Ninja A: Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja B: Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group
Ninja C: Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group
Ninja D: Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group
Ninja E: Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group
Ninja F: Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group
Remember, the ninjas and pirates will lie about individual ninjas or pirates, not groups of ninjas or pirates.","Think about what Ninja A said, first.","Ninja A is a pirate
Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja C is a ninja
Ninja D is a pirate
Ninja E is a pirate
Ninja F is a ninja
Ninja A said that Ninja B is a ninja. This is because Ninja A is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja A told the truth.
Ninja B said that Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja B is a ninja and Ninja C is a ninja, so Ninja B lied.
Ninja C said that Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group. Ninja C is obviously from the same group as Ninja C, so Ninja C lied.
Ninja D said that Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group. Ninja D is a pirate and Ninja A is a pirate so Ninja D lied.
Ninja E said that Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group. Ninja E is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja E told the truth.
Ninja F said that Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja F is a ninja and Ninja E is a pirate, so Ninja F told the truth.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in full:

Assign “ninja” = 1, “pirate” = 0 for every person A-F.

Rule for every statement  
 Truth of the statement = (speaker is ninja) XOR (person spoken about is ninja).  
(This follows because a ninja (1) tells the truth (1) about pirates (0) and lies (0) about ninjas (1), while a pirate (0) does the opposite.)

Identify, for each sentence, who is the person actually being spoken about:

1. A says: “B is a ninja.”  (subject = B)  
2. B says: “C belongs to A’s group.” (subject = C)  
3. C says: “C doesn’t belong to F’s group.” (subject = C)  
4. D says: “A belongs to B’s group.” (subject = A)  
5. E says: “B belongs to C’s group.” (subject = B)  
6. F says: “E belongs to A’s group.” (subject = E)

Translate the content of each sentence into a Boolean value (1 = true, 0 = false) and equate it to “speaker XOR subject”.

(1)  B = A XOR B                                                …(i)  
(2)  (C = A) = B XOR C                                          …(ii)  
(3)  (C ≠ F) = C XOR C = 0   ⇒  C ≠ F must be false ⇒ C = F     …(iii)  
(4)  (A = B) = D XOR A                                          …(iv)  
(5)  (B = C) = E XOR B                                          …(v)  
(6)  (E = A) = F XOR E                                          …(vi)

Solve step-by-step.

From (i): B = A XOR B  ⇒  A must be 0.  (So A is a pirate.)

Plug A = 0 into (ii): (C = 0) = B XOR C  
 • If C = 0, left side 1 ⇒ B = 1.  
 • If C = 1, left side 0 ⇒ ¬B = 0 ⇒ B = 1.  
Thus B = 1 (B is a ninja).

From (iv): (A = B) = 0 = D XOR 0 ⇒ D = 0. (D is a pirate.)

Let C be unknown for the moment; from (iii) we already have F = C.

From (v): (B = C) = (1 = C) = C = E XOR 1 ⇒ E = ¬C.

Insert E = ¬C and F = C into (vi):  
   (E = 0) = ¬E = C XOR E = C XOR ¬C = 1  
So ¬E = 1 ⇒ E = 0. Therefore C = 1 and hence F = 1.

We now have:

A = 0 (pirate)  
B = 1 (ninja)  
C = 1 (ninja)  
D = 0 (pirate)  
E = 0 (pirate)  
F = 1 (ninja)

The six letter code word, <([])>, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?",Attire,Casual and Formal,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step–by–step reasoning  

1.  Write down the five possible letters for every position in the six–symbol code

   1st “< ” → {F, E, C, R, P}  
   2nd “( ” → {N, A, H, O, B}  
   3rd “[ ” → {F, S, E, D, R}  
   4th “] ” → {W, M, J, U, Y}  
   5th “) ” → {T, E, S, A, L}  
   6th “> ” → {E, R, L, K, S}

2.  The fourth position is very restrictive, permitting only W, M, J, U, or Y.  
    Look for ordinary six-letter English words whose fourth letter is one of those five.

3.  Among such words with the allowed first three letters, FORMAL appears:

        F  (in {F,E,C,R,P})  
        O  (in {N,A,H,O,B})

        A  (in {T,E,S,A,L})  
        L  (in {E,R,L,K,S})

    FORMAL fits perfectly.

4.  Search for a six-letter opposite of FORMAL that also respects the letter-lists.  
    CASUAL works:

        C  (in {F,E,C,R,P})

        A  (in {T,E,S,A,L})  
        L  (in {E,R,L,K,S})

5.  Consequently, the code <([])> can be read as either

97,"Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).","Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
98,"Long ago, back before serious illness existed and the new inventions of today, there lived the Handy People. Their height was measured in hands, and they lived long lives.

2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.", it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true,"Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years

Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Har – 14 hands, 110 years

101,"You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.

Inside every pair decide, during the planning session, who will be the
    “same–as’’ player and who will be the “opposite–to’’ player.

At the moment of the shout each person looks only at the colour of the partner’s band:

• the “same–as’’ player guesses that his own band is the same colour as his partner’s;  
• the “opposite–to’’ player guesses that his own band is the opposite colour of his partner’s.

Why this always gives at least one correct guess in every pair  
If the two head-bands in a pair are the same colour, then the “same–as’’ player is right.  
If the two head-bands are of different colours, then the “opposite–to’’ player is right.  
So every pair contributes at least one correct guess.

Therefore at least 250 of the 500 people are certain to guess correctly, no matter how the black and white head-bands are distributed.

Why you can never guarantee more than 250 correct guesses  
Fix any deterministic strategy.  
For a particular person, keep all the other 499 bands fixed; that person sees the same
scene whether his own band is black or white, yet he can name only one colour.
Hence, for each of the 2 possible colours of his own band, he can be correct in at most one.
Consequently, out of the 2·2^499 = 2^500 possible full colourings, this person is correct in at most 2^499 of them—only half.
Summing over all 500 people, the average number of correct guesses over all 2^500 colourings is at most  
 500·2^499 / 2^500 = 250.  
If a strategy could guarantee 251 correct guesses in every colouring, the average would have to be at least 251, contradicting the bound we just found.
So no strategy can force more than 250 correct guesses in every possible assignment.

Combining the lower and upper bounds, 250 is the best that can be guaranteed.

There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.

Then flip over all 128. That group of 128 and the group of all the remaining pennies will have the same number of heads facing up.
This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1. While blindfolded, pick any 128 pennies from the table and set them aside.

   • The rest of the pennies form pile B.

2. Still blindfolded, flip every penny in pile A over (head → tail, tail → head).

That’s all.

Why it works  
• Suppose pile A originally contained h heads.  
• Because there are 128 heads in total, pile B originally contains 128 − h heads.  

• Flipping pile A turns each of its h heads into tails, and its 128 − h tails into heads.  
  So after flipping, pile A now has 128 − h heads.

• Pile B was never touched, so it still has 128 − h heads.

104,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.

(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

 3·9 = 27   (2 , 7)     14   ✓
 4·7 = 28   (2 , 8)     16   ✓
 4·9 = 36   (3 , 6)     18   ✓
 6·8 = 48   (4 , 8)     32   ✗  (H duplicates G)

 7·8 = 56   (5 , 6)     30   ✗  (I would be 0)
 7·9 = 63   (6 , 3)     18   ✗
 8·9 = 72   (7 , 2)     14   ✓

The surviving possibilities are therefore

(A) D·G = 27  (B=2, H=7)  
(B) D·G = 28  (B=2, H=8)  
(C) D·G = 36  (B=3, H=6)  
(D) D·G = 72  (B=7, H=2)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Test each survivor with equation (4)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (4):  G·I = 10C + F,  so the units digit of G·I must be F and the tens digit C.
Recall I is already the units digit of B·H found in Step 1.

For each survivor compute I and then G·I.

(A)  D·G=27 ⇒ (B,H)=(2,7) ⇒ B·H=14 ⇒ I=4  
     If G=9: 9·4 = 36 ⇒ C=3, F=6  (C duplicates D) ❌  
     If G=3: 3·4 = 12 ⇒ C=1, F=2  (C duplicates J later) ❌

(B)  D·G=28 ⇒ (B,H)=(2,8) ⇒ I=6  
     If G=7: 7·6 = 42 ⇒ C=4, F=2  (C duplicates B) ❌  
     If G=4: 4·6 = 24 ⇒ C=2, F=4  (C duplicates B, F duplicates G) ❌

(C)  D·G=36 ⇒ (B,H)=(3,6) ⇒ I=8  
     If G=9: 9·8 = 72 ⇒ C=7, F=2  (A·F impossible, see next step) ❌  
     If G=4: 4·8 = 32 ⇒ C=3, F=2  (C duplicates B) ❌

(D)  D·G=72 ⇒ (B,H)=(7,2) ⇒ I=4  
     Choose G=9, D=8 (G must differ from H)  
     9·4 = 36 ⇒ C=3, F=6   (all digits still unique!) ✔

All other arrangements fail; only case (D) survives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Satisfy equation (1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
We now have

B=7, H=2, I=4, J=1, C=3, F=6, D=8, G=9

Equation (1):  A·F = 10C + E  
               A·6 = 30 + E

Because 1 ≤ A ≤ 9, A·6 can be 30, 36, 42, 48, or 54.  
But the left side must begin with the tens digit C = 3, so A·6 must be 30 or 36.

• If A = 5,  A·6 = 30 ⇒ E = 0, and 0 has not been used yet.  
• If A = 6,  A·6 = 36 ⇒ E = 6, which repeats the digit F.  Impossible.

Hence A = 5 and E = 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – Collect the digits
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A = 5  
B = 7  
C = 3  
D = 8  
E = 0  
F = 6  
G = 9  
H = 2  
I = 4  
J = 1

Every digit 0–9 appears exactly once and all four equations hold:

5·6 = 30  → CE = 30 ✓  
7·2 = 14  → JI = 14 ✓  
8·9 = 72  → BH = 72 ✓  
9·4 = 36  → CF = 36 ✓

108,"In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.

 10C + D = 27  → 3·27 = 81 ⇒ A = 8, J = 1

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step  

1. The dog has two possible actions:  
  E = eat the flower.  
  N = do not eat the flower.

2. The flower decides, before the dog acts, whether or not to develop poison:  
  P = produce poison.  
  NP = do not produce poison.  
 The dog cannot see this decision.

3. Pay-offs for the dog  
  • If it eats a non-poisonous flower → dog certainly lives.  
  • If it eats a poisonous flower   → dog certainly dies.  
  • If it does not eat        → dog lives with probability ½.  
 So for the dog, “eat” is better than “do not eat” only when it assigns to P a probability strictly below ½.

4. Pay-offs for the flower  
  • If the dog does not eat it → flower survives and, if it made no poison, it avoids the unpleasant work.  
  • If the dog will eat it and it has no poison → flower certainly dies.  
  • If the dog will eat it and it has poison  → dog dies quickly and the flower survives.  
 Producing poison is tiresome, so the flower will do it only when that is necessary to avoid being eaten, but whenever its life is at stake it will certainly make the poison (assumption 6 is explicit about this).

5. What happens if the dog plans to eat?  
 Because the flower is perfectly rational and knows the dog’s plan, it realises that its life is in danger and therefore it surely chooses P.  
 Hence, if the dog chooses E, the probability that the flower is poisonous is 1, so the dog’s chance of survival is 0.

6. What happens if the dog plans not to eat?  
 Knowing it is safe, the flower gains nothing by producing poison, so it chooses NP.  
 The dog’s chance of survival is then the uninfluenced ½.

7. The dog now compares the two possibilities that its own reasoning has produced:  
  Eat → survival probability = 0.  
  Not → survival probability = ½.  
 Because ½ > 0, the rational dog chooses not to eat the flower.

8. Once the dog has settled on N, the flower, seeing that it will not be attacked, does not waste the effort of producing poison.

Conclusion  
The only rational course for the dog is to leave the flower alone; it will accept the external 50 % risk rather than face certain death.

Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

t  = the real time (in minutes after 12 : 00) when Little Mad Ade leaves home.  
tₘ = the time he THINKS he sees, i.e. the mirror image of t.

1. Mirror–image relation  
For an ordinary 12-hour clock, a perfect left-right mirror turns every time t into  
tₘ = 720 min − t.  
(Example: 3 : 00 → 9 : 00 because 720 − 180 = 540 min = 9 : 00.)

2. Relation produced by the ride  
He reaches school 20 min later, so the real time on arrival is t + 20.

3. What the school clock shows  
That clock shows a time 2½ h = 150 min later than the time he thought he saw, i.e.  
t + 20 = tₘ + 150.

4. Put the two equations together  
t + 20 = (720 − t) + 150

Arrival = t + 20 = 7 : 05 + 0 : 20 = 7 : 25 a.m.

Check:

The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).  But block 4 must also have a letter from YELP, which can only be P, and a letter from BODY, which can only be D.  G is on block 3 (PUGS), as is Q(QUAD).  Block 3, which already has C, G, I, N, and Q, can only have one more letter:  this sixth letter must be in both BODY and YELP, so it must be Y.  B is on block 1 (BODY).  Block 1, then, contains B, J, M, U, and W, and can have only one more letter:  this sixth letter must be in both LIFT and YELP, so it must be L.  Finally, block 2 holds E (YELP) and F (LIFT).  In summary:
Block 1:  B, J, L, M, U, W

115,"One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?",,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Observing the game we notice the rule that every time someone is tapped

• he (or she) later gives back exactly the same number of taps  
• to the person who tapped him and to everyone that person had already tapped,  
• except himself (and, of course, the RELIGIOUS FIGURES never give any taps at all).

Thus no new names can ever be introduced after the first time someone taps: every subsequent tap is always directed only to people that have already appeared in somebody’s earlier “tap‐list”.  

Looking at the initial lists supplied by the Stooges, the Kings and the two Queens we see that the only names that ever appear are

Moe, Larry, Curly, James, Saul, Henry, Pope, Gandhi, Victoria, Elizabeth.

Neither Mother Teresa nor Candace ever occurs in any tapper’s list, and—because of the rule above—they never can occur later.  
Since Religious Figures never tap anyone, Mother Teresa can never receive a tap from within her own group, and no one outside her group will ever add her name spontaneously.  
Candace is in the same situation: no one has tapped her, so her name is not in anyone’s list, hence no future tapper will be allowed to touch her.

Therefore the only people who will remain forever untapped are

Mother Teresa and Candace.

Final answer: Mother Teresa and Candace",True
116,"Four members of the Madadian pro-celebrity Kebab wrestling team took part in a charity pool match to raise money for new spandex sequined grease proof leotards
Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff and Hayden Seek participated in the POOL competition.
FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

A = Al Gore-Rhythm  
B = Annie Buddyhome  
D = Dan Druff  
H = Hayden Seek  

For every game 15 balls are on the table, so the two scores in a game always add to 15.

Label the six games and the points each player scores in them:

AB : A₁ , B₁  (A₁ + B₁ = 15)  
AD : A₂ , D₂  (A₂ + D₂ = 15)  
AH : A₃ , H₁  (A₃ + H₁ = 15)  
BD : B₂ , D₃  (B₂ + D₃ = 15)  
BH : B₃ , H₂  (B₃ + H₂ = 15)  
DH : D₄ , H₃  (D₄ + H₃ = 15)

Write the tournament totals:

A_total = A₁ + A₂ + A₃  
B_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃  
D_total = D₂ + D₃ + D₄  
H_total = H₁ + H₂ + H₃

Now impose the given outcomes one by one.

1. H_total = 18  
   H₁ + H₂ + H₃ = 18.

2. A_total is odd. (Keep for later.)

3. Dan beat Hayden by 5 in their game DH: D₄ = H₃ + 5.  
   With D₄ + H₃ = 15, this gives  

  H₃ = 5 , D₄ = 10.

4. AB was decided by one point: |A₁ – B₁| = 1.

5. In AD, Al scored twice Dan: A₂ = 2 D₂ and A₂ + D₂ = 15 →

From A₂ = 2 D₂: 3 D₂ = 15 → D₂ = 5 , A₂ = 10.

6. Hayden scored one less v Al than v Dan: H₁ = H₃ – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4.  
   Therefore in AH A₃ = 15 – H₁ = 11.

7. Dan scored 7 against Annie: D₃ = 7 → B₂ = 15 – 7 = 8.

At this point every per-game score except the AB and BH games is fixed:

AD : 10–5  AH : 11–4  DH : 10–5  
BD : 8–7

Work out BH from Hayden’s total.  
H₁ + H₂ + H₃ = 4 + H₂ + 5 = 18 ⇒ H₂ = 9.  
So BH : 6–9 (because B₃ + 9 = 15 gives B₃ = 6).

Finally, solve the AB game.  
B so far has 8 + 6 = 14 points from BD and BH, so

 B_total = B₁ + 14.  
Al so far has 10 + 11 = 21 points from AD and AH, so

 A_total = A₁ + 21.

Because A₁ + B₁ = 15 and |A₁ – B₁| = 1, the only possibilities are
 (A₁ , B₁) = (8, 7) or (7, 8).

Take each in turn:

(A₁ , B₁) = (7, 8) → A_total = 28 (even) – violates condition 2.  
(A₁ , B₁) = (8, 7) → A_total = 29 (odd) – acceptable.

Thus AB was 8–7 in Al’s favour, and all conditions are satisfied.

Totals:

Al Gore-Rhythm 29  
Dan Druff   22  
Annie Buddyhome 21  
Hayden Seek  18

Winner: Al Gore-Rhythm with 29 points.

Final answer: Al Gore-Rhythm won. Scores – Al 29, Dan 22, Annie 21, Hayden 18.",True

119,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?",,"Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.  There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.  Namely, for (Snap, Crackle, Pop) they are:
(1, 7, 6)
(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.
And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – What Snap’s remark tells us  
Snap saw his own number s and was immediately sure that Crackle’s and Pop’s numbers were different.  
The only way the other two envelopes could contain equal numbers is if their total 14-s were split into two equal halves, i.e. if 14-s were even.  
Since Snap is certain equality is impossible, 14-s must be odd ⇒ s is odd.

Step 2 – What Crackle’s remark tells us  
Crackle, before Snap spoke, already knew that all three numbers were different.  
Let Crackle’s number be c; then Snap and Pop must add to 14-c.

• If c were even, 14-c would also be even and the two unknown envelopes could each have value (14-c)/2, making them equal – Crackle could not rule that out.  
⇒ c cannot be even; c is odd.

• If c ≤ 6 then one of the other envelopes could equal c itself (because 14-2c would still be a positive integer).  
⇒ To rule this out Crackle must have c > 6.

The odd numbers > 6 and still small enough to leave something for the others are 7, 9, 11.  
So Gretchen (and Pop) now know Crackle’s number is in {7, 9, 11}.

Step 3 – Listing the still-possible triples  
Use s odd, c ∈ {7, 9, 11}, all positive and different, s + c + p = 14.

c = 7  → s + p = 7  
 s = 1 ⇒ p = 6  (s, c, p) = (1,7,6)  
 s = 3 ⇒ p = 4  (s, c, p) = (3,7,4)  
 s = 5 ⇒ p = 2  (s, c, p) = (5,7,2)

c = 9  → s + p = 5  
 s = 1 ⇒ p = 4  (s, c, p) = (1,9,4)  
 s = 3 ⇒ p = 2  (s, c, p) = (3,9,2)

c = 11 → s + p = 3  
 s = 1 ⇒ p = 2  (s, c, p) = (1,11,2)

These are the only six triples still possible after Snap’s and Crackle’s remarks.

Step 4 – What Pop’s remark tells us  
Pop sees his own number p and, using the above information, is able to identify the whole triple uniquely.

Check each p that appears in the list:

p = 2 → could pair with (c,s) = (7,5) or (9,3) or (11,1)  (3 possibilities)  
p = 4 → could pair with (c,s) = (7,3) or (9,1)      (2 possibilities)  
p = 6 → only possible with (c,s) = (7,1)          (1 possibility)

For Pop to be able to say “Now I know all three numbers,” his envelope must contain 6.  
Hence p = 6, and the only compatible triple is

Snap s = 1  
Crackle c = 7  
Pop   p = 6

Step 5 – Gretchen’s deduction  
Gretchen heard exactly what we did and performed the same elimination.  
Seeing that Pop’s statement fixes his number at 6 and forces the unique triple (1, 7, 6), she could raise her hand and give the three numbers with certainty.

Final answer: Snap has 1, Crackle has 7, Pop has 6.",True
