0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Strategy the prisoners agree on during their one-time meeting

1. Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.

2. Decide that  
   • switch A will be the counting switch,  
   • switch B is just a “dummy’’ switch that can be flipped any time a prisoner is forced to move some switch but does not want to change the value of A.

   The warden has told them that both switches are now OFF, so everybody knows the initial state.

Rules each prisoner follows later

COUNTER’S RULES  
• He keeps in his memory a number Count, initially 0.  
• Every time he is taken to the switch room

    – If switch A is ON, he flips A to OFF and sets  
      Count ← Count + 1.  

    – If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B (so that he does satisfy the “must flip exactly one switch’’ rule).

• Whenever Count reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  
  “All of us have visited the switch room.”

NON-COUNTER’S RULES  
Each non-counter remembers a personal flag called Signalled, initially FALSE.

When he is taken to the switch room he does the following.

    – If Signalled = FALSE and switch A is OFF  
      (that is, he has never succeeded in signalling before and A is currently OFF)  
      * flip switch A from OFF to ON, and  
      * set Signalled ← TRUE.  
      (This is his one and only contribution to the count.)

    – Otherwise  
      flip switch B (again, just to comply with the “must flip one switch’’ rule).

Why the strategy works

1. Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).

2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.

3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.

4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random “indefinitely’’ (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.

5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter’s declaration is certainly true.

6. Premature declaration is impossible:  
   • For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  
   • A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  
   • That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  
   • A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  
   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.

Consequently the counter’s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF→ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON→OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.",True

Step-by-step deduction

4) D = G·4  or  D = E/3  
If D = G·4, G can be 0,1,2 giving (G,D) = (0,0), (1,4), (2,8).  
(G,D) = (0,0) repeats a digit, so exclude.  
Keep two possibilities: (1,4) or (2,8).

If D = E/3, D ≤ 3 while E is a multiple of 3.  This would repeat a digit when (G,D) = (1,4) or (2,8), so we stay with D = G·4 and the two pairs above.

5) E = J – 1  or  E = D/4  
With (G,D) = (1,4) ⇒ D/4 = 1 duplicates G, impossible.  
With (G,D) = (2,8) ⇒ D/4 = 2 duplicates G, impossible.  
Hence E = J – 1 (so J = E + 1) and D = G·4 with (G,D) = (2,8).

Thus far:  G = 2,  D = 8,  J = E + 1.

7) G = F + 1  or  G = I – 3  
With G = 2:  
 • If G = F + 1 ⇒ F = 1.  
 • If G = I – 3 ⇒ I = 5 duplicates neither but we will see it fails later.  
Take G = F + 1 so F = 1 (will soon be forced).

6) F = B·2  or  F = A – 4  
F = 1 cannot equal B·2 (no integer B), so F = A – 4 ⇒ A = 5.

1) A = B/3  or  A = G + 3  
Now A = 5 and G = 2, so A = G + 3 holds (5 = 2 + 3).  
Therefore A ≠ B/3 and B is still unknown.

8) H = A/2  or  H = C·3  
A/2 = 2.5 not integral, so H = C·3 and C ≤ 3.

3) C = J + 2  or  C = F·3  
Since F = 1, F·3 = 3 is possible and keeps C ≤ 3.  
Choose C = 3 (from C = F·3).

Then 8) gives H = 3·3 = 9.

9) I = H + 3  or  I = D/2  
H + 3 = 12 impossible, so I = D/2 = 8/2 = 4.

2) B = I – 4  or  B = E + 4  
With I = 4, I – 4 = 0, so one valid choice is B = 0.

Digits used so far: A5, B0, C3, D8, F1, G2, H9, I4.  
Remaining digits {6,7} must be E and J, and since J = E + 1 we get  
E = 6, J = 7.

10) J = H – 2  or  J = C·2  
H – 2 = 9 – 2 = 7, matching J, so the first alternative is satisfied.

Final answer: 5038612947",True
4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the 1000 equally–spaced points  
0,1,2,…,999 around a circle.

Choose an integer step-size s (1 ≤ s ≤ 999) and start at 0.  
Join 0 to s, then s to 2s, then 2s to 3s, … each time reducing modulo 1000.  
A single unbroken “star” is obtained exactly when

1. gcd(1000, s)=1 (so every vertex is met before we get back to 0),  
2. s≠1, 999 (otherwise the figure is just the regular 1000-gon).

Condition 1 means s must be coprime with 1000; the number of such s is Euler’s totient
φ(1000).

 1000 = 2³·5³  
 φ(1000) = 1000(1−½)(1−⅕) = 1000·½·⅘ = 400.

Among these 400 admissible s-values, one pair is {1,999}; remove it, leaving 398.

The step-sizes s and 1000−s trace the same picture, only in opposite directions,
so each star is counted twice.  Hence

number of distinct stars = (398)/2 = 199.

Final answer: 199",True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):

At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):

Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:
