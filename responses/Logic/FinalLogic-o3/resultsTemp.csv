0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Strategy the prisoners agree on during their one-time meeting

1. Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.

2. Decide that  
   • switch A will be the counting switch,  
   • switch B is just a “dummy’’ switch that can be flipped any time a prisoner is forced to move some switch but does not want to change the value of A.

   The warden has told them that both switches are now OFF, so everybody knows the initial state.

Rules each prisoner follows later

COUNTER’S RULES  
• He keeps in his memory a number Count, initially 0.  
• Every time he is taken to the switch room

    – If switch A is ON, he flips A to OFF and sets  
      Count ← Count + 1.  

    – If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B (so that he does satisfy the “must flip exactly one switch’’ rule).

• Whenever Count reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  
  “All of us have visited the switch room.”

NON-COUNTER’S RULES  
Each non-counter remembers a personal flag called Signalled, initially FALSE.

When he is taken to the switch room he does the following.

    – If Signalled = FALSE and switch A is OFF  
      (that is, he has never succeeded in signalling before and A is currently OFF)  
      * flip switch A from OFF to ON, and  
      * set Signalled ← TRUE.  
      (This is his one and only contribution to the count.)

    – Otherwise  
      flip switch B (again, just to comply with the “must flip one switch’’ rule).

Why the strategy works

1. Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).

2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.

3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.

4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random “indefinitely’’ (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.

5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter’s declaration is certainly true.

6. Premature declaration is impossible:  
   • For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  
   • A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  
   • That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  
   • A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  
   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.

Consequently the counter’s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF→ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON→OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.",True

Step-by-step deduction

4) D = G·4  or  D = E/3  
If D = G·4, G can be 0,1,2 giving (G,D) = (0,0), (1,4), (2,8).  
(G,D) = (0,0) repeats a digit, so exclude.  
Keep two possibilities: (1,4) or (2,8).

If D = E/3, D ≤ 3 while E is a multiple of 3.  This would repeat a digit when (G,D) = (1,4) or (2,8), so we stay with D = G·4 and the two pairs above.

5) E = J – 1  or  E = D/4  
With (G,D) = (1,4) ⇒ D/4 = 1 duplicates G, impossible.  
With (G,D) = (2,8) ⇒ D/4 = 2 duplicates G, impossible.  
Hence E = J – 1 (so J = E + 1) and D = G·4 with (G,D) = (2,8).

Thus far:  G = 2,  D = 8,  J = E + 1.

7) G = F + 1  or  G = I – 3  
With G = 2:  
 • If G = F + 1 ⇒ F = 1.  
 • If G = I – 3 ⇒ I = 5 duplicates neither but we will see it fails later.  
Take G = F + 1 so F = 1 (will soon be forced).

6) F = B·2  or  F = A – 4  
F = 1 cannot equal B·2 (no integer B), so F = A – 4 ⇒ A = 5.

1) A = B/3  or  A = G + 3  
Now A = 5 and G = 2, so A = G + 3 holds (5 = 2 + 3).  
Therefore A ≠ B/3 and B is still unknown.

8) H = A/2  or  H = C·3  
A/2 = 2.5 not integral, so H = C·3 and C ≤ 3.

3) C = J + 2  or  C = F·3  
Since F = 1, F·3 = 3 is possible and keeps C ≤ 3.  
Choose C = 3 (from C = F·3).

Then 8) gives H = 3·3 = 9.

9) I = H + 3  or  I = D/2  
H + 3 = 12 impossible, so I = D/2 = 8/2 = 4.

2) B = I – 4  or  B = E + 4  
With I = 4, I – 4 = 0, so one valid choice is B = 0.

Digits used so far: A5, B0, C3, D8, F1, G2, H9, I4.  
Remaining digits {6,7} must be E and J, and since J = E + 1 we get  
E = 6, J = 7.

10) J = H – 2  or  J = C·2  
H – 2 = 9 – 2 = 7, matching J, so the first alternative is satisfied.

Final answer: 5038612947",True
4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the 1000 equally–spaced points  
0,1,2,…,999 around a circle.

Choose an integer step-size s (1 ≤ s ≤ 999) and start at 0.  
Join 0 to s, then s to 2s, then 2s to 3s, … each time reducing modulo 1000.  
A single unbroken “star” is obtained exactly when

1. gcd(1000, s)=1 (so every vertex is met before we get back to 0),  
2. s≠1, 999 (otherwise the figure is just the regular 1000-gon).

Condition 1 means s must be coprime with 1000; the number of such s is Euler’s totient
φ(1000).

 1000 = 2³·5³  
 φ(1000) = 1000(1−½)(1−⅕) = 1000·½·⅘ = 400.

Among these 400 admissible s-values, one pair is {1,999}; remove it, leaving 398.

The step-sizes s and 1000−s trace the same picture, only in opposite directions,
so each star is counted twice.  Hence

number of distinct stars = (398)/2 = 199.

Final answer: 199",True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

15,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.
The rest go like this-
1st House: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Cats, Dunhill
2nd House: Blue, Dane, Tea, Horse, Blends
3rd House: Red, Brit, Milk, Birds, Pall Malls
4th House: Green, German, Coffee, FISH, Prince
5th House: White, Swede, Beer, Dogs, Bluemasters",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the five houses stand in a row, numbered 1 (leftmost) to 5 (rightmost).  
For every house we have to determine  

• colour • nationality • drink • cigar • pet  

and each attribute must occur exactly once.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Set down the immediately fixed facts
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 9: House 1 = Norwegian  
Rule 8: House 3 drinks Milk  
Rule 14: Norwegian lives next to the blue house  ⇒  House 2 = Blue

─────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Locate the Green and White houses
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 4: Green is immediately left of White.

The pair (Green, White) cannot be (1,2) because 2 is already Blue;  
not (2,3) because 2 is Blue;  
not (3,4) because 3 already drinks Milk but rule 5 says Green drinks Coffee.

Therefore (Green, White) = (4,5).  
Rule 5 then gives: House 4 drinks Coffee.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Find the remaining colours
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Colours used so far: Blue(2), Green(4), White(5).  
The two colours left are Red and Yellow, for houses 1 and 3.

Rule 7: Yellow-house smokes Dunhill.  
Two cases:

A. House 1 = Yellow (⇒ Dunhill in 1)  
B. House 3 = Yellow (⇒ Dunhill in 3)

Case A quickly proves consistent; Case B sooner or later contradicts several rules.  
We continue with Case A.

So far
House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Dunhill  
House 3: Red

Rule 1: Brit lives in the Red house  ⇒  House 3 = Brit.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Use the Dunhill / horse neighbour rule
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 11: Horse owner lives next to Dunhill.  
Dunhill is in house 1, so the neighbour is house 2.  
⇒ House 2 keeps a Horse.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Work with Blends, Water and Cats
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 15: Blends smoker lives next to Water drinker.  
Rule 10: Blends smoker lives next to Cat keeper.

If Water were anywhere except house 1 we would run into a dead end,  
so place Water in house 1.  
Then Blends must be in its only neighbour, house 2, satisfying rule 15.  
To satisfy rule 10 as well, put Cats in house 1.

Now
House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Dunhill, Cats  
House 2: Blue, –, –, Blends, Horse

─────────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Identify the Dane and his drink
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The Dane drinks Tea (rule 3).  
Tea is still unassigned and the only house that can take it so far is house 2.  
⇒ House 2 = Dane, drinks Tea.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
7.  Place Beer and Bluemasters
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Drinks used: Water(1), Tea(2), Milk(3), Coffee(4).  
The only drink left is Beer, so Beer is in house 5.  
Rule 12: Bluemasters smoker drinks Beer  ⇒  house 5 smokes Bluemasters.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
8.  Locate Prince and the German
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Cigars left: Pall Mall, Prince.  
Rule 13: German smokes Prince.

If Prince were in house 3 (Brit) or house 5 (already Bluemasters) we'd clash,  
so Prince must be in house 4, making house 4 the German.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
9.  Put Pall Mall and Birds
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The last unassigned cigar is Pall Mall, so it belongs to house 3.  
Rule 6: Pall Mall smoker keeps Birds  ⇒  house 3 keeps Birds.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
10.  Finish the pets and nationalities
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Pets assigned so far: Cats(1), Horse(2), Birds(3).  
Left: Dogs and Fish.

Rule 2: Swede keeps Dogs  ⇒  house 5 is the Swede with Dogs.  
The only pet still missing is Fish, therefore house 4 keeps Fish.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
11.  Check that every rule is met
─────────────────────────────────────────────
All fifteen statements are satisfied by the completed table:

House 1: Norwegian Yellow Water Dunhill Cats  
House 2: Dane    Blue  Tea  Blends  Horse  
House 3: Brit    Red   Milk  Pall Mall Birds  
House 4: German  Green  Coffee Prince  Fish  
House 5: Swede   White  Beer  Bluemasters Dogs

16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

s = # snakes  
b = # birds  
m = # mammals  
i = # insects  
p = # spiders  

Remember that in each group there is exactly one “odd” animal:

• snake with 3 heads (2 extra heads)  
• bird with 2 heads (1 extra head)  
• mammal with 3 legs (1 leg short)  
• insect with 4 legs (2 legs short)  
• spider with 7 legs (1 leg short)

Heads  
Every animal normally has 1 head, plus the 3 extra heads above, so  
s + b + m + i + p + 3 = 100  ⇒ s + b + m + i + p = 97 (1)

Legs  
Snakes give 0 legs.  
Birds give 2b legs.  
Mammals give 4m − 1 legs.  
Insects give 6i − 2 legs.  
Spiders give 8p − 1 legs.  

2b + (4m − 1) + (6i − 2) + (8p − 1) = 376  
⇒ 2b + 4m + 6i + 8p = 380 (2)

Special conditions  
4) Insect legs = 2 × bird legs: 6i − 2 = 4b ⇒ b = (3i − 1)/2 (3)  
5) Snake heads = spider heads: s + 2 = p ⇒ p = s + 2 (4)

Insert p from (4) into (1):

s + b + m + i + (s + 2) = 97 ⇒ 2s + b + m + i = 95 (5)

Insert p from (4) into (2):

2b + 4m + 6i + 8(s + 2) = 380  
⇒ b + 2m + 3i + 4s = 182 (6)

Insert (3) into (5) and (6).  
From (6) and (5) one finds i − b = −8, hence i = b − 8.  
Combine with (3):  i = (3i − 1)/2 − 8 ⇒ i = 17 and b = 25.

Now (5) gives

2s + m = 53 (7)  
while (6) gives the same equation m + 2s = 53.  
So m = 53 − 2s.

Now apply the remaining conditions:

• All five quantities different.  
• Max − min = 10.

Try integer values for s (m must stay positive):

s  m=53−2s  p=s+2   set {s,p,m,17,25}   max−min

20,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

What's the middle sportsman's number?","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.
If d=2, the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 can be made into 1*8*9=3*4*6=72, and we can have c=9, e=4: 9*2*4=72.
If d=8, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 can be made into 1*4*9=2*3*6=36, but 36 is not divisible by 8.

Given  
a·b·c = c·d·e = e·f·g .               (∗)

From the first and the second equality we obtain  
a·b = d·e …………… (1)  
and from the second and the third equality  
c·d = f·g …………… (2)

So the middle number d must belong to two different products of two
other distinct digits.

Step 1.  Which numbers 1–9 can be written in TWO different ways as a
product of two distinct digits 1–9?  
Listing the possibilities gives

6 = 1·6 = 2·3  
8 = 1·8 = 2·4  
12 = 2·6 = 3·4  
18 = 2·9 = 3·6  
24 = 3·8 = 4·6  

No other integer ≤ 81 has this property.

Hence in (1) the common value a·b = d·e must be one of
6, 8, 12, 18, 24.  
In each case we try to place the four distinct digits
(a, b, d, e) and then look whether (2) can still be satisfied with the
three remaining unused digits.

Step 2.  Exhaustive check.

• Product 6 : {1, 6} and {2, 3}.  
 If d = 2 or 3, equation (2) cannot be fulfilled without repeating a
digit. No solution.

• Product 8 : {1, 8} and {2, 4}.  
 Taking d = 2, e = 4, a = 1, b = 8 we still have the digits
3, 6, 9 left.  
 Choose c = 9, then c·d = 9·2 = 18 and we can take f = 3, g = 6
(3·6 = 18).  
 This gives the row 1  8  9  2  4  3  6, which satisfies (∗).

 If d were 4, or if we exchanged the two pairs, (2) cannot be met.
 So product 8 works only with d = 2.

• Product 12 : {2, 6} and {3, 4}.  
 Trying all possibilities for d (2,3,4,6) leaves no way to satisfy (2)
with the remaining digits. No solution.

• Product 18 : {2, 9} and {3, 6}.  
 With d = 2, e = 9, a = 3, b = 6 the unused digits are 1, 4, 8.  
 Put c = 4, then c·d = 4·2 = 8 and take f = 1, g = 8
(1·8 = 8).  
 Row: 3  6  4  2  9  1  8 – condition (∗) holds.

 All other choices for d (3,6,9) fail.

• Product 24 : {3, 8} and {4, 6}.  
 None of the four possibilities for d satisfies (2). No solution.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  What can the last person (call him P10) transmit?  
    – He is allowed to utter exactly one of two words, “white” or “black”.  
    – Therefore he can convey at most one single binary bit of information to the other nine people.  

2.  Why can we not guarantee that all 10 survive?  
    – The unknown configuration of hats is a 10-bit string (each hat = 0 for black, 1 for white).  
    – Everybody except P10 sees at most 9 of those bits.  
    – Only one additional bit (the one word said by P10) can be added to what the others already see.  
    – A single bit is insufficient to distinguish all 10 possibilities for P10’s own hat colour, so P10 cannot be sure of saving himself.  
    – Hence, at best 9 of them can be saved with certainty, and that is the optimum we must aim for.

3.  A one-bit message that lets the other 9 deduce their own colours.  
    – The most familiar one-bit property of a set of binary digits is “parity”, i.e. whether the number of 1’s is even or odd.  
    – Plan: encode the parity of white hats P10 sees.  

4.  The convention agreed upon during the night  
    • “white” uttered by P10 means:  “The number of white hats I (P10) can see is EVEN.”  
    • “black” uttered by P10 means:  “The number of white hats I can see is ODD.”  
    (Any other fixed assignment of the two words to the two parities would work equally well; this one is just explicit.)

5.  How the daytime play proceeds  

    P10 (sees 9 hats).  
       – Counts the white hats in front of him.  
       – Announces “white” if that count is even, otherwise “black”.  
       – He survives with probability ½ (he does not know his own colour) but has now broadcast the parity bit.

    P9 (sees 8 hats).  
       – He has heard the announced parity and he sees the colours of P1–P8.  
       – Let W be the number of white hats he sees.  
       – If announced parity = “even” and W is even, then his own hat must be black; if announced parity = “even” and W is odd, his hat must be white.  
       – If announced parity = “odd”, reverse the conclusion.  
       – He says the deduced colour and is guaranteed to be correct.  
       – Before P8 is addressed, everyone still alive recomputes the new “running parity” by flipping it whenever someone just announced “white”.  (Operationally easier: Pk simply remembers what has already been said and what he still sees; the algebra works out.)

    P8, P7, … , P1 proceed identically:  
       – Each of them knows the original parity bit and has heard all answers between P10 and himself, so he can compute the parity of the unseen hats that still remain.  
       – Comparing that with what he actually sees, he infers his own colour with certainty.

6.  Verification by an example  

    Suppose the true hat line (from P10 at the back to P1 at the front) is  
          W  B  B  W  W  B  W  B  B  W  
          10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  

    • P10 sees eight whites?  Count = 5 whites (odd) → says “black” (odd parity).  
    • P9 hears “odd”, sees 4 whites (even) ⇒ must himself be white → says “white”, lives.  
    • P8 now knows current parity should be “odd XOR white‐said” = even, sees 3 whites (odd) ⇒ he is white → speaks, lives.  
      … and so on; everyone down to P1 determines the colour correctly.

7.  Optimality proof  

    • Because the first spoken word can carry only one bit of information, any deterministic protocol must leave P10 with at least two equally possible colours consistent with what he sees and the message he is constrained to give.  Therefore his survival probability can never exceed ½.  
    • Once P10’s word is fixed, the remaining nine people together see nine hats plus the one-bit message, i.e. the entire information needed to deduce their own colours uniquely.  So the above protocol, which indeed guarantees perfect knowledge for the remaining nine, is optimal.

Conclusion  
The best achievable strategy guarantees the survival of 9 out of the 10 islanders; the very last person in line survives with probability ½.  The concrete protocol is:

Last person: say “white” if you see an even number of white hats, “black” otherwise.  
Each subsequent person: knowing the original parity and what has been said so far, compare it with the parity of white hats you still see; speak the only colour that makes parities match.

Final answer: 9 people are guaranteed to live; the strategy is that the last person encodes the parity (even/odd) of white hats he sees with the word “white”/“black”, and everyone after him uses that bit together with what they observe to deduce and announce their own hat colour with certainty.",True
23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

24,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.
The names of BEAUTY's mom and aunt and that of the oldest black are immaterial. The same is true with the color of lucky.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"The only horse that can fit all the clues about last year’s Derby entry is the second brown horse.

•  There are exactly two brown horses on the farm.  
•  One of them is the 3-year-old colt BILLY (this year’s Derby hopeful).  
•  The other brown horse therefore must be older than three (otherwise there would be more than three 3-year-olds, contradicting the poem).  
•  A Kentucky-Derby runner must be exactly three; hence that older brown horse was three last year and four now.  
•  The poem says “their stallion’s loss last year was a pity,” so this older brown horse is a stallion.  
•  Among the remaining named horses the only one whose description has not yet been fixed is ROCKY, and ROCKY is also mentioned as slower than the three-year-olds, which fits a 4-year-old.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the required 10-digit number be  

  A B C D E F G H I J (each of 0-9 once).

Translate every clue.

1) A + D is a perfect square (∈ {0,1,4,9,16}).  
2) G + J is a triangular number (∈ {0,1,3,6,10,15}).  
3) B + I is even.  
4) E · F is odd  ⇒  E and F are distinct odd digits.  
5) C · H is prime  ⇒  one of C,H is 1 and the other is a prime digit (2,3,5,7).  
6) A / G = G / C  ⇒  A·C = G² (A,C,G are distinct digits; G ≠ 0).  
7) E + I = B + H.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Find all possibilities for (A,C,G).

Because A·C = G² ≤ 9·9 = 81, list squares ≤ 81 and factor them into two distinct digits:

      4  = 1·4  → (A,C,G) = (1,4,2) or (4,1,2)
      9  = 1·9  → (1,9,3) or (9,1,3)
      16 = 2·8  → (2,8,4) or (8,2,4)
      36 = 4·9  → (4,9,6) or (9,4,6)

So eight candidate triplets appear.

Step 2.  Use clue 5 (C·H prime).

• If C ≠ 1 the product cannot be prime, so only triplets with C = 1 survive.  
  That leaves  

  (A,C,G) = (4,1,2) or (9,1,3).

• One more possibility survives when C = 2 and H = 1 (because 2·1 = 2 is prime), i.e.  

  (A,C,G) = (8,2,4).

Hence three cases remain:

 A  C  G
1) 4  1  2
2) 9  1  3
3) 8  2  4

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Work each case.

CASE 1 A=4, C=1, G=2
• Clue 1: 4 + D is a square → D = 0 or 5.  
• Clue 2: 2 + J triangular → J = 8.  
• H must be a prime digit ≠ 2 (clue 5) → H = 3,5,7.  

Try D = 0  ⇒ remaining digits {3,5,6,7,9}.  After exhaustive check of
all ways to satisfy clues 3,4,7, no arrangement works.

Try D = 5  ⇒ remaining digits {0,3,6,7,9}.  
 • Let H = 3.  The only way to satisfy clues 3,4,7 is

  B = 6, E = 9, F = 7, I = 0.

 This gives the number 4 6 1 5 9 7 2 3 0 8.

 • H = 5 or 7 cannot satisfy the conditions.

Thus a complete solution is obtained: 4615972308.

CASE 2 A=9, C=1, G=3
Clue 1 gives D = 0 or 7; clue 2 then forces J = 7 or 0 respectively.
Either way not enough odd digits remain to have two distinct odds E,F,
so no solution here.

CASE 3 A=8, C=2, G=4
Clue 5 forces H = 1, but then clue 1 has no digit D that makes 8 + D a
square.  No solution.

Hence the single consistent arrangement is the one found in Case 1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Verification of 4615972308

A=4, B=6, C=1, D=5, E=9, F=7, G=2, H=3, I=0, J=8

1) 4+5 = 9  (square)  
2) 2+8 = 10 (triangular)  
3) 6+0 = 6  (even)  
4) 9·7 = 63 (odd)  
5) 1·3 = 3  (prime)  
6) 4/2 = 2  and 2/1 = 2

1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I

Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar

This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June

A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.

'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image.

1. Picture of a human brain  
   – The cerebral cortex is divided into four principal lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital.

2. Picture of Earth  
   – We commonly speak of the four seasons or of the “four corners of the earth”.

3. The incomplete phrase “Fair and ____”  
   – The only word that naturally completes it is “square”; a square possesses four equal sides (and four corners).

4. The letters AZ CO NM UT  
   – These are the U.S. postal abbreviations for Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, the only place in the United States where the borders of exactly four states meet (“the Four-Corners”).

5. A cheese sandwich with the crust perfectly cut off  
   – A slice of sandwich bread has four crust edges (four corners); cutting the crust off removes those four edges.

Each image, in its own way, points to the same idea: the number FOUR (or “four corners”).

With seven doors available, the door that “corresponded to the commonality of the images” must be the fourth door.

30,"A car thief, who had managed to evade the authorities in the past, unknowingly took the automobile that belonged to Inspector Detweiler.  The sleuth wasted no time and spared no effort in discovering and carefully examining the available clues.  He was able to identify four suspects with certainty that one of them was the culprit.
The four make the statements below.  In total, six statements are true and six false.
Suspect A:
1. C and I have met many times before today.
2. B is guilty.
3. The car thief did not know it was the Inspector's car.
Suspect B:

32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

34,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.

8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step  

Notation  
• N = number of blue–eyed islanders (unknown to the castaways, but in the real situation N = 100).  
• “Night k” means the k-th night after the guru’s announcement.  
• All islanders are perfect logicians and act only when absolutely certain.  
• The guru’s public sentence “I see a person with blue eyes” is heard by everybody and is known by everybody to be heard by everybody, etc.; thus it becomes common knowledge.

1. Why the guru’s sentence matters  
Before the announcement every islander already sees at least one blue-eyed person (unless he himself is the only one).  
However, that fact is not common knowledge: if I see a blue-eyed person I do not know whether the person I am looking at also sees a blue-eyed person.  
The guru’s statement changes this: now everyone knows that everybody knows that there is (at least) one blue-eyed person.

2. Base case: N = 1  
Suppose there were exactly one blue-eyed islander B.  
• B sees no blue eyes among the other 199 people.  
• The guru declares that she sees a blue-eyed person.  
• Hence B deduces that the only possible blue-eyed person is himself; he is now certain of his eye colour and leaves on Night 1.  
• Nobody else ever leaves (they are not certain of their own colour).

3. Induction step  
Assume the rule is true for every island with fewer than N blue-eyed people:  
“If there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave together on Night k.”

Now consider an island with N (≥2) blue-eyed people.  
Pick any blue-eyed islander X. X sees N–1 blue-eyed people around him.

X’s reasoning:  
a. “If my eyes were not blue, there would only be N–1 blue-eyed islanders.”  
b. “By the inductive hypothesis those N–1 people would then all leave on Night (N–1).”  
c. “If Night (N–1) passes with no one leaving, my assumption in (a) must be false; therefore my eyes are blue.”  

Every blue-eyed islander carries out exactly the same reasoning, so:

• If nobody leaves on Night 1, everybody (in particular every blue-eyed person) knows there cannot be exactly 1 blue-eyed person.  
• If nobody leaves on Night 2, everybody knows there cannot be exactly 2, etc.  
• After Night (N–1) passes empty, each blue-eyed islander becomes certain the true number is N and that he himself is one of them.  
• Therefore all N blue-eyed people step forward together on Night N and leave.  
• No brown-eyed (or any other-coloured) islander ever becomes certain of his own colour, so they stay forever.

4. Application to the given numbers  
The real island has N = 100 blue-eyed inhabitants.  
• Nights 1, 2, …, 99 pass with no one disembarking.  
• At sunset of Night 100 every blue-eyed islander is now absolutely sure his eyes are blue, and all 100 of them announce “My eyes are blue,” board the ship, and sail away.  
• The 100 brown-eyed islanders remain, forever uncertain of whether their eyes are brown, green, purple, etc.

Final answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100th night; everyone else stays.",True
38,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in full

1.  Let N be the largest number of throws we are willing to spend in the worst case.  
    •  With two balls, if the first ball is thrown from floor f1 and breaks, we may still have to make up to (f1–1) additional single–floor throws with the second ball; the total would be 1+(f1–1)=f1 throws.  
    •  If the first ball survives the first throw, we next try some higher floor f2.  If it now breaks we have already used 2 throws and may need at most (f2–f1–1) more single–floor throws.  The total in this branch must not exceed N, so  
                 (f2–f1–1)+2  ≤ N  ⇒  f2–f1 ≤ N–1.  
      Likewise every successive step must shorten the gap by one, otherwise one branch of the search tree would exceed N throws.

    Hence if the worst-case limit is N, the successive gaps between floors tried by the first ball must be
            N, (N–1), (N–2), … , 3, 2, 1
    and their sum must be at least the 100 floors that have to be covered:
            N+(N–1)+…+1 = N(N+1)/2  ≥ 100.

2.  Solve N(N+1)/2 ≥ 100.  
        N = 13  →  13·14/2 = 91  (too small)  
        N = 14  →  14·15/2 = 105  (just enough)  

    Therefore 14 throws are necessary and sufficient: no strategy can guarantee success in fewer, and there exists a strategy that never needs more than 14.

3.  Construct the required floors.

    Start with a gap of 14, then 13, then 12, … decreasing by one each time:

        1st throw: 14        (gap 14)
        2nd throw: 14+13 = 27   (gap 13)
        3rd throw: 27+12 = 39   (gap 12)
        4th throw: 39+11 = 50   (gap 11)
        5th throw: 50+10 = 60   (gap 10)
        6th throw: 60+ 9 = 69   (gap 9)
        7th throw: 69+ 8 = 77   (gap 8)
        8th throw: 77+ 7 = 84   (gap 7)
        9th throw: 84+ 6 = 90   (gap 6)
       10th throw: 90+ 5 = 95   (gap 5)
       11th throw: 95+ 4 = 99   (gap 4)
       12th throw: 99+ 3 = 102  (>100)

    We stop at floor 100 instead of 102; that last gap is only 1, which is allowed because we have already covered all 100 floors.

    So the list of test floors is
        14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

4.  Why it works.

    •  If the first ball breaks on the k-th throw, there have been (k–1) throws so far and the gap that has just failed is (14–k+1).  
    •  We then linearly test at most that many floors with the second ball.  
    •  Total throws in that branch = (k–1) + 1 + (14–k) = 14.

    No branch uses more than 14 throws, so the worst-case number of trials is 14, which is optimal.

Order of floors to drop from (stop as soon as the first ball breaks):
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

With this schedule the highest safe floor will always be found in at most 14 drops, and no strategy can guarantee doing better with only two balls.",True

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  
R = the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves,  
B = 100 – R = the number of blue-hatted dwarves.  
We are told 1 ≤ R ≤ 99, and every dwarf is perfectly logical.

Key facts every dwarf knows (and knows that the others know, etc.)  
1. Every night all 100 dwarves see the other 99 hats.  
2. It is forbidden to talk about hat colours.  
3. There is **at least one red and at least one blue hat**.  
4. A dwarf who can deduce that his own hat is red must stay away from the very next feast and never return.

We prove by induction on R how many nights elapse before the red-hatted dwarves stop coming.

-------------------------------------------------
Base case R = 1  
The single red dwarf sees 0 red hats.  
Because everybody knows there is at least one red hat, he alone can conclude, on the very first night, “I must be the red one.”  
He therefore stays home the next night.  
So all red hats disappear after 1 day.

-------------------------------------------------
Induction step  
Assume for some k ≥ 1:  
“If exactly k red hats are present, then they all leave after k nights.”

Now suppose there are k + 1 red hats.

Each red-hatted dwarf sees k red hats.  
He reasons: “If my own hat were blue, then there would be exactly k red hats. By the induction hypothesis those k dwarves would all leave after k nights. So if I attend the feast on the (k + 1)-st night and still see every one of those k red dwarves present, I will know my assumption was wrong and my own hat must be red.”

Exactly that happens: during the first k nights no one leaves (each is still unsure); on the (k + 1)-st night every red dwarf still sees the k others and therefore realises he, too, is red. Consequently all k + 1 reds stay home the next night and never return.

Hence, if there are k + 1 red hats, they disappear after k + 1 nights, completing the induction.

-------------------------------------------------
Conclusion  
If there are R red-hatted dwarves, they will all stay away starting on the (R + 1)-st feast; equivalently, it takes exactly R days before there are no red hats at the party.

Because the total population is 100 with at least one blue hat, R can be at most 99, so the number of days required is some integer R between 1 and 99 — precisely equal to the actual number of red-hatted dwarves.

Final answer: After exactly as many days as there are red-hatted dwarves (at most 99), no red-hatted dwarf will attend the feast.",True

5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy, and is therefore our Neptunian Assassin.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four adjacent booths be numbered 1 – 4 from left to right.  
For every ambassador we note whether he is

 T = tentacled  S = slimy  G = green.

Exactly one alien is simultaneously G, T and S – this is the Neptunian assassin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Putting Agurgle

Clue 2 says Agurgle is in a booth that has two neighbours, each of which is
NOT green.  
Therefore Agurgle must be in one of the two middle booths (2 or 3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Using the “tentacled” clue

Clue 1: “Wym-Inar is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly
ONE tentacled alien.”

Put Wym-Inar at the left-hand end (booth 1).  
Then the booth next to him (booth 2) must be tentacled, because Wym-Inar
has to be next to exactly one tentacled alien.

Now work rightwards:

•  If booth 2 is the only tentacled neighbour of Wym-Inar, the alien in
booth 4 must **also** be tentacled; otherwise the alien in booth 3 would be
next to exactly one tentacled neighbour, contradicting the fact that
only Wym-Inar enjoys that property.

Thus the pattern of “T / not-T” is

 booth 1 booth 2 booth 3 booth 4  
    –     T    –     T

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Placing the names

Because booth 2 or 3 must hold Agurgle, and booth 1 already holds
Wym-Inar, two possible line-ups remain:

 (A) 1 Wym-Inar  2 Agurgle  3 ChimChim  4 Mr Johnson  
 (B) 1 Wym-Inar  2 Agurgle  3 Mr Johnson 4 ChimChim

Case (A) will fail (see below), case (B) will work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Working with the “slimy” clue – Case (A) fails

Clue 3: “ChimChim is the only ambassador NOT in a booth next to exactly
one un-slimy alien.”

In line-up (A) ChimChim is in booth 3.
Let S = 1 mean “slimy”.

•  For Wym-Inar (booth 1) to be next to exactly one un-slimy,
Agurgle (booth 2) must be un-slimy ⇒ S₂ = 0.

•  ChimChim (booth 3) would then have one neighbour un-slimy
(Agurgle) and one neighbour whose sliminess we shall see is slimy,
so ChimChim would be next to exactly **one** un-slimy alien – forbidden.
Hence line-up (A) is impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Working with line-up (B)

Line-up (B): 1 Wym-Inar 2 Agurgle 3 Mr Johnson 4 ChimChim  
(T-pattern – T – T stays as before.)

Let us assign sliminess.

(i)  Wym-Inar (booth 1) has only neighbour Agurgle.
    For Wym-Inar to be next to **exactly one** un-slimy alien,
    Agurgle must be un-slimy  
    ⇒ S₂ = 0.

(ii) Mr Johnson (booth 3) is not ChimChim, so he too must be next to
     exactly one un-slimy neighbour.
     His neighbours are Agurgle (unslimy) and ChimChim (unknown).  
     This will be satisfied iff ChimChim is slimy  
     ⇒ S₄ = 1.

(iii) With S₄ = 1, ChimChim (booth 4) has **zero**
      un-slimy neighbours (his only neighbour, Johnson, is slimy).  
      ChimChim is therefore the unique ambassador **not** next to
      exactly one un-slimy alien – precisely what Clue 3 requires.

(iv) Finally Agurgle (booth 2) now has neighbours
     Wym-Inar (unslimy) and Johnson (slimy) – exactly one un-slimy neighbour.
     Clue 3 is satisfied for everyone.

So the slimy pattern is

 booth 1 booth 2 booth 3 booth 4  
   S=0   S=0   S=1   S=1

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  The assassin

Only the aliens in booths 2 and 4 are tentacled.
Of those, only booth 4’s occupant (ChimChim)

 • is tentacled (T = 1)  
 • is slimy  (S = 1)

Make him green as well (nothing forbids this – his only neighbours have
already been declared non-green by Clue 2) and he is the sole
green-tentacled-slimy creature, i.e. the Neptunian assassin.

All three clues and all conditions are now met.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NASA therefore keep the door of booth 4 shut – the assassin is

ChimChim from Pluto.

D1 D2 D3 D4 D5

Run one race in each lane-group (5 races).  
Inside each heat we now know the complete order

A1<A2<A3<A4<A5, … , E1<E2<E3<E4<E5.

Step 2 – race the five heat-winners (race 6)  
Race A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 together.  
Suppose the order of this “final” is

A1 < B1 < C1 < D1 < E1.      (If another order occurs just relabel the heats;
                                 the argument is identical.)

What we already know

• Any horse in heats D or E is slower than D1 or E1, which are already
  beaten by three other horses, so none of them can be in the overall top 3.  
  ⇒ throw away 10 horses.

• Inside heat C, horses C2,C3,… are all slower than C1 which is already
  beaten by A1 and B1, so C2 and C3 cannot reach the top 3 either.  
  ⇒ discard C2,C3,C4,C5.

• Inside heat B, horse B3 is slower than B2<B1, and the top two places are
  already occupied by A1 and at least one of A2/A3/B1, so B3 cannot reach
  the podium.  
  ⇒ discard B3,B4,B5.

After these eliminations only six animals can still be in the first three
overall:

A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.

(The track has only five lanes, but A1 is already known to be the fastest of
all – it beat everyone in its heat and all other heat-winners.  
So we can leave A1 standing and race the other five.)

Step 3 – the last race (race 7)  
Race the five remaining candidates

A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , C1.

Whatever the order in this race, combine it with the inequalities already
known:

• A1 beats everybody,  
• B1 beats C1 (from race 6),  
• A2 beats A3 (heat A),  
• B1 beats B2 (heat B).

From these data we can read off the overall second- and third-place horses.
Thus after the 7th race the complete podium is fixed.

Why 7 races are unavoidable  
After the sixth race the relative order between A2, A3, B1, B2 and C1 is
still totally unknown; any of those five could still be second or third.
Because only five horses can be compared in one race you need at least one
more race, so no scheme can succeed in fewer than 7 races.

50,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.

5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.

11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"All the brother needs is the fact that a big saw keeps turning for quite a while after the current is cut: the sooner the current is cut, the longer the blade has been slowing down when he next looks at it, and therefore the slower (or more completely stopped) it will be.

1. While he is still in the sawing room the brother touches nothing; he merely notes that every machine is running.

2. He leaves the room and shuts the door.  
   Outside he now works only on the five back-up switches and keeps careful track of the time.

   • At time t = 0 he throws one of the back-up switches to OFF.  
   • Exactly one minute later he throws a second back-up switch to OFF.  
   • One minute later he throws a third switch to OFF,  
   • after another minute a fourth switch to OFF,  
   • and, after the fourth interval, he throws the last switch to OFF.

   (Any convenient equal interval – half-minutes, whole minutes, etc. – will do; the only requirement is that all intervals be the same and that, during the whole operation, the brother remembers the order in which he opened the five switches.)

3. The moment the fifth switch has been opened he re-enters the machine room.

   Because a saw’s blade has a large moment of inertia, the five machines are now in five distinctly different states:

   • the machine whose current was cut first has had the longest time to slow down and will be completely stopped (or almost so);  
   • the machine cut second will be turning very slowly;  
   • the machine cut third a little faster;  
   • the machine cut fourth still faster;  
   • and the machine whose current was cut last will be spinning almost at full speed.

4. By simply ranking the machines from “stopped” through “fastest”, the brother knows in exactly what order their power was removed.  
   He already knows in what order he opened the back-up switches, so he can pair each machine with the correct outside switch.

5. He can now walk back into the corridor and label (or otherwise identify) every back-up switch with the machine it controls, having learned the correspondence solely by operating the switches and making one final inspection of the machines.

Final answer: he turns the five outside switches OFF one after another at equal time intervals, immediately goes back inside, and matches the machines’ different degrees of run-down (from stopped to almost full speed) to the order in which he opened the switches; this uniquely identifies which outside switch belongs to which machine.",True

Position 5 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 7 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 11 - Chris Mass
From clue (3), the only possible positions for Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are Position 2 and Position 10.
Now there are 3 positions remaining - 6, 8 and 9 and remaining 3 suspects are Hugo Phurst, Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick. But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.
Suspects from left to right are: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass.
Thus,
Diddy Dewit (1), Ewan Watarmy (4), Hugo Phurst (6), Lou Stooth (7) and Chris Mass (11) are the suspects whose positions are fixed.
Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are at position 2 or 10.
Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants are at position 3 or 5.
Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick are at position 8 or 9.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We label the 11 places in the line-up 1 (far left) to 11 (far right); the centre place is 6, where the main culprit (MC) must stand.

We translate each clue into position conditions:

1. Barb and Chris are >6.  
2. Exactly two between Ewan and Lou  ⇒ |E−L| = 3.  
3. Seven between Mike and Phil ⇒ |M−P| = 8 → only pairs (1,9), (2,10), (3,11).  
4. Gerry is to the right of Hugo.  
5. Robin and Polly are on opposite sides of Ewan.  
6. Diddy and Polly are <6.  
7. Six between Chris and Ewan ⇒ |C−E| = 7 → possible pairs (1,8), (2,9), (3,10), (4,11) with Chris on the right member (because Chris>6).  
8. Two between Ewan and Diddy ⇒ |E−D| = 3.

Trying each Chris/Ewan pair:

• (C=8,E=1) fails (Lou would coincide with Diddy).  
• (C=9,E=2) fails (Lou coincides with Diddy).  
• (C=10,E=3) fails (Diddy would be at 6 which is not “left of” MC).  
• (C=11,E=4) survives all distance rules:

 Ewan = 4, Chris = 11  
 Diddy must be 1 (distance 3 from Ewan and left of MC).  
 Lou must be 7 (distance 3 from Ewan, not conflicting with Diddy).  
 To satisfy clue 3 we choose Mike = 2 and Phil = 10 (distance 8).  
 Barb (right of MC) can go to 8 or 9; pick Barb = 8.  
 Robin and Polly must be on opposite sides of Ewan and Polly <6.  
 Choose Polly = 3 (left of Ewan) and Robin = 5 (right of Ewan).  
 Remaining unplaced names: Hugo and Gerry with Gerry right of Hugo; places left are 6 and 9.  
 Put Hugo = 6 (the centre) and Gerry = 9.

Line-up now is  
1 Diddy, 2 Mike, 3 Polly, 4 Ewan, 5 Robin, 6 Hugo, 7 Lou, 8 Barb, 9 Gerry, 10 Phil, 11 Chris.

Every clue checks out perfectly, so the person in the centre, position 6, is Hugo Phurst.

If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Every time a boat negotiates the whole flight the water that was in the top lock ends up in the river at the bottom.  
Loss of water from the summit per passage

 • Capacity of one lock = 7 000 L = 7 t  
 • Number of locks in the flight = 13  
 • Water lost per passage = 13 × 7 000 L = 91 000 L ≈ 91 t

Water that a hired road-tanker can bring up

 • Truck capacity = 22 t = 22 000 L

Number of loads that have to be hauled up for every single boat

 91 t ÷ 22 t ≈ 4.1  → 5 full tanker-loads

Thus, for just one boat the lorry must climb the hill five times; two boats would need ten trips, and a modest pleasure-boat traffic of, say, ten boats a day would require about fifty tanker journeys a day.  That is clearly impractical as a day-to-day way of keeping the summit pound in water and would cost far more than installing a small pump or providing a proper water feed.

Therefore the proposed contract to keep the canal supplied by carting water up the hill in a 22-ton truck is not reasonable.",True

5. X is a square number.

Which statements are true?","All of the statements involve X in them, but some of the statements give direct information about whether they're true or not, and also potential hints for X.","If X is 2, then statements 2 and 3 create a paradox. Therefore, X is not 2, so statements 2 and 3 are both true because the ""if"" part is not satisfied.
Therefore, statement 6 must be true, because if X is less than 3, we know X must be 2. In this case, statement 5 is false.
However, because statement 6 is true, there are at least 3 true statements, meaning we can't conclude if statement 5 is false based on this statement alone.
Statement 7 is false because X is definitely greater than 2, and the previous statement was true.
Statement 1 and 4 must be false, because their truth will imply their falseness.
For example, if statement 4 was true, then it won't be satisfied anymore (as there are at least 4 statements true), so it can't be true.
But statement 5 must then be true, else statements 1 and 4 will become true.
Conveniently, X is 4, and is a square number, as statement 5 implies.
Therefore, statements 2, 3, 5, 6 are true.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let us label the sentences

(0)  “X statements below are true.”          (the un-numbered first line)  
(1)  “X is 3.”  
(2)  “If X is 2, then the following statement is false.”  
(3)  “If X is 2, then the previous statement is true.”  
(4)  “X is less than 4.”  
(5)  “X is a square number.”  
(6)  “If X is less than 3, then the previous statement is false.”  
(7)  “If X is greater than 2, then the previous statement is false.”

Our job is to find a value of X and a truth-value for each sentence so that every sentence has a definite (classical) truth value.  
Let Tₖ denote “statement (k) is true”.

1.  Consequences of X ≠ 2  
    • If X ≠ 2, the antecedent “X is 2” in (2) and (3) is false, so both implications are automatically true:  
      T₂ = T₃ = true.

    • If X = 2, the two implications give the system  
         T₂ = ¬T₃ and T₃ = T₂,  
      which forces T₃ = ¬T₃, an impossibility.  
      Therefore X cannot be 2.

    So from now on we know X ≠ 2 and hence T₂ = T₃ = true.

2.  Remaining sentences as functions of X  
    T₁ = (X = 3).  
    T₄ = (X < 4).  
    T₅ = (X is a perfect square).  
    T₆ = true, except that if X < 3 then it is true only when T₅ is false.  
    T₇ = true when X ≤ 2; when X > 2 it equals ¬T₆.

3.  Trial of possible X’s  
    We must have 0 ≤ X ≤ 7, because only seven numbered statements can be true.

    • X = 0,1,3 give five true statements below line 0, contradicting (0).  
    • X ≥ 5 and not a square give three true statements below line 0, contradicting (0).  
    • X ≥ 5 and a square (9, 16, …) give four true statements below line 0, contradicting (0).

    • X = 4 (note that 4 is a square) yields:

         T₁ : false                (4 ≠ 3)  
         T₂ : true                 (see section 1)  
         T₃ : true                 (see section 1)  
         T₄ : false                (4 < 4 is false)  
         T₅ : true                 (4 is a square)  
         T₆ : true                 (antecedent “X<3” is false)  
         T₇ : false                (X>2 is true but ¬T₆ is false)

      Exactly four of the seven numbered statements are true (namely 2,3,5,6), so sentence (0) is itself true: “4 statements below are true.”

4.  Uniqueness  
    We have already seen that any other value of X makes (0) false, so the assignment X = 4 is the only consistent one.

Thus the full, consistent truth assignment is

True  : statements 0, 2, 3, 5, 6  
False : statements 1, 4, 7.

d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉ d₁₀.

Translate every clue:

1. All digits 0–9 are used once.  

2. d₃ + d₄ = d₆ · d₉.                      (1)  
3. d₅ · d₁₀ is odd  ⇒  d₅, d₁₀ are odd.     (2)  
4. d₂ > d₅ > d₇.                            (3)  
5. d₈ > d₆ > d₂.                            (4)  
6. d₂ + d₆ + d₉ is a perfect square.        (5)  
7. d₄ + d₉ = d₁₀.                           (6)  
8. d₁ + d₅ = d₇ + d₁₀.                      (7)  
9. d₉ is even.                              (8)

Step 1 – Use parity facts  
• (2) ⇒ d₅, d₁₀ are odd.  
• (6) with (8): d₄ = d₁₀ – d₉.  d₁₀ odd, d₉ even ⇒ d₄ odd.  
• (1) requires d₃ + d₄ even.  Since d₄ is odd, d₃ must be odd.  

Thus four of the five odd digits {1,3,5,7,9} sit at positions 3,4,5,10.  
Therefore exactly one of the remaining positions {1,2,6,7,8,9} is odd.  
But d₉ is even, so the single remaining odd digit is in {2,6,8}.  

Step 2 – Restrict d₆ and d₉ via (1)  
d₃ + d₄ is the sum of two odd digits ⇒ it can be 4,6,8,10,12,14,16.  
Hence d₆ · d₉ ≤ 16.  With d₉ ∈ {2,4,6,8} (cannot be 0), the feasible pairs are  
(d₆,d₉) ∈ { (3,4), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (2,8), (2,6), (2,4), (1,8), (1,6), (1,4) }.  
Because of the chain d₈ > d₆ > d₂ > d₅ > d₇, d₆ must exceed 2, so discard pairs with d₆ = 1 or 2.  
Remaining possibilities:

a) (d₆,d₉) = (3,4)  (product 12)  
b) (d₆,d₉) = (3,2)  (product 6)  
c) (d₆,d₉) = (4,2)  (product 8)  
d) (d₆,d₉) = (5,2)  (product 10)  
e) (d₆,d₉) = (6,2)  (product 12)  
f) (d₆,d₉) = (7,2)  (product 14)

Step 3 – Try the possibilities and test the other rules  

Case (b) (d₆,d₉) = (3,2) fails because (5) gives d₂ + 3 + 2 = 7, not a square.  

Case (a) (d₆,d₉) = (3,4) works beautifully:  
• (1) demands d₃ + d₄ = 12.  The only way with distinct odd digits is 5 + 7 or 7 + 5.  
  Choose d₃ = 7, d₄ = 5 so that (6) produces an in-range digit: d₁₀ = d₄ + d₉ = 5 + 4 = 9.  
• (3) now forces d₅ odd and less than d₂; let d₅ = 1 (smallest remaining odd).  
  Then (3) with d₆ = 3 dictates d₂ = 2 and d₇ = 0.  
• Check (5): d₂ + d₆ + d₉ = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, a perfect square.  
• (7) requires d₁ + d₅ = d₇ + d₁₀ ⇒ d₁ + 1 = 0 + 9 ⇒ d₁ = 8.  
• The only unused digit now is 6, which fits (4) as d₈ (since 6 > 3 > 2).  

All digits 0-9 are now placed uniquely:

Position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
Digit    : 8 2 7 5 1 3 0 6 4 9

Step 4 – Final verification  
(1) 7 + 5 = 12 and 3 × 4 = 12 ✓  
(2) 1 × 9 = 9 (odd) ✓  
(3) 2 > 1 > 0 ✓  
(4) 6 > 3 > 2 ✓  
(5) 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (square) ✓  
(6) 5 + 4 = 9 ✓

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Company B did not really give the Emperor three different prices for exactly the same job; he gave him three prices for three very different kinds of job.  
What was different was not the bridge (it would be identical in every case) but the **speed** with which the bridge would be finished – and, therefore, the value that finishing it early would have for the country.

What the contractor told the Emperor (in substance) was this:

• “If you want the bridge finished **in six months**, I will have to put every crew I have on the site, hire extra men, fly in equipment and materials, and pay very large overtime premiums.  I can do it, but it will cost you **$1 000 000**.

• “If you are willing to wait **about a year**, I can schedule the job in with other work I already have, use the men and machinery that will be free by then, and avoid most of the overtime.  Done that way the bridge will cost **$750 000**.

• “If you really do not care how long it takes and are content to have the bridge sometime in the next **two-to-three years**, I can work on it only when I have idle capacity and left-over materials from other jobs.  Under those conditions I could build it for **$200 000**.

“Put the three figures in the contract.  
When the bridge is finished you, and only you, will decide which completion date you wanted and pay the corresponding price.”

The moment the Emperor heard the explanation he accepted the offer and told the contractor to start at once on the six-month schedule.  

Why?  
Because the Emperor’s main aim was to revitalise the islands quickly, attract tourists and new residents, and stop the population from shrinking.  Every extra month without the bridge would cost the country far more than the extra construction cost in lost tourist revenue and lost opportunities.

58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

n = number of friends  (1 < n < 10)  
T = total number of Golden kebab tokens  

1.  Two pairs of sisters  
   – 4 friends belong to the two sister-pairs.  
   – The remaining n − 4 friends are unrelated single–member families.  
   Therefore the number of families is  

  F = 2 (the two sister families) + (n − 4) = n − 2.

2.  “Tokens per family are 5 more than tokens per friend”  

  T /(n − 2) = T /n + 5  
 ⇒  T [ 1/(n − 2) – 1/n ] = 5  
 ⇒  T · 2 /[n(n − 2)] = 5  
 ⇒  T = 5 n(n − 2) / 2.                      (★)

   For T to be an integer, n(n − 2) must be even ⇒ n must be even.  
   With n < 10 and ≥ 4 (we need 4 sisters) the even possibilities are n = 4, 6, 8.

   • n = 4 Impossible, because all four would be sisters and Norha Bone is not in either pair.  
   • n = 6 gives T = 5·6·4 /2 = 60.  
   • n = 8 gives T = 5·8·6 /2 = 120.

3.  Wendy gives up her share  
   – Each friend originally received T /n tokens.  
   – Wendy’s share T /n must be divisible by the remaining n − 1 friends, because it is redistributed whole.

   Check divisibility:

   • n = 6 T /n = 60/6 = 10,  10 divisible by 5 → OK.  
   • n = 8 T /n = 120/8 = 15,  15 divisible by 7 → NO.

   Hence the only feasible value is n = 6.

4.  Final distribution when n = 6  
   Initial share per friend = 60 / 6 = 10 tokens.  
   Wendy’s 10 tokens split among the other 5 friends → each of them gets 10/5 = 2 extra.  
   Therefore each of the remaining five friends finishes with 10 + 2 = 12 tokens,  
   while Wendy keeps none.

Final answer: 6 friends in all; after Wendy renounced her share, the other five friends ended up with 12 Golden kebab tokens each (Wendy received none).",True

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1). The house to the west is my (mister Kvakk's) house (10).
-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field
-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.
The shortest route (measured in number of gardens) is: Kvakk's house / The field / Longo / Flower-heaven",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"From the clues we can reconstruct (one possible) map of the gardens and their adjacencies.  
The key steps are:

•  Quack’s house borders only Duck Country and The Forest (clue 7).  
•  Hence the shortest Kuakk → Quack route is  
  Kvakk – X – Duck Country – Quack (clues 1 & 5, with X ≠ Field, Forest, Angel’s Valley or Star).  

•  The shortest Quack → Flower-heaven route is  
  Quack – Forest – Angel’s Valley – Flower-heaven (clues 9 & 16).

•  Flower-heaven is therefore adjacent to The Mountain (clue 4), to Angel’s Valley (clue 16) and to exactly one further garden (clue 13).  
  That third neighbour has to be a garden that is adjacent to The Field, because “there is one garden between The Field and Flower-heaven’’ (clue 3).  
  From clue 8 The Field touches six gardens: the Lawn, Longo, the Pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk’s house.  
  Of these only the Pool can be chosen without breaking any other clause, so

        The Pool is the third and last garden that borders Flower-heaven.

•  We already know from clue 4 that the Pool borders Kvakk’s house.

Putting the last two bullets together gives the shortest possible connection:

    Kvakk’s house  –  The Pool  –  Flower-heaven.

That path contains only one intervening garden, and no shorter path is possible because Flower-heaven does not border Kvakk’s house directly.

Final answer: The dog should go from Kvakk’s house into The Pool and from there straight into Flower-heaven.",True
61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.

When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before.

Try every assignment of the three periods {2,3,7} to (Edgar, Frank, George) together with all possible first-visit day-numbers (they must be the earliest numbers ≤ period length that give the stated weekdays).

The only assignment that fulfils the weekday requirements

 • Edgar’s first visit Monday  
 • Frank’s first visit Wednesday  
 • George’s first visit Friday  

is:

 Edgar – every 7 days, first visit day 6

Step 4.  Check uniqueness

For any possible month length (28, 29, 30, 31 days) day 27 lies inside the month, and no later common day (34, 41, …) is inside the month, so there is exactly one such day, as required.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.

We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

68,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?
1) B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = AD
2) B - H = J - G = 3
3) C - F = E - I = 5
4) B * I = AJ","The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.","2951804637
A = 2, B = 9, C = 5, D = 1, E = 8, F = 0, G = 4, H = 6, I = 3, J = 7
1) 9 + 5 + 0 + 7 = 8 + 4 + 6 + 3 = 21
2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.
F) Returning to equations #2 and #3, eliminate additional possibilities.  E must be: 7, 8, 9.  G must be: 3, 4, 5.  H must be: 3, 4, 5, 6.  This results in F = 0 and C = 5.
G) Since H can not be 5, B can not be 8.  Since G can not be 5, J can not be 8.  Going back to equation #4, eliminate those equations where either B or J is 8.  B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, and J = 7.
H) The last four letters can now be assigned values.  D = 1, E = 8, G = 4, and H = 6.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning steps

1.  Let the digits be A B C D E F G H I J (all different, A≠0).

2.  Translate the clues.

   •  B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = 10A + D          (since AD is the two-digit number with tens A, units D)  
   •  B – H = J – G = 3                                (so B = H+3, J = G+3)  
   •  C – F = E – I = 5                                (so C = F+5, E = I+5)  
   •  B·I = 10A + J                                    (since AJ is the two-digit product)

3.  Substitute the differences into the equal sums:

     B + C + F + J = (H+3) + (F+5) + F + (G+3)  
                   = H + G + 2F + 11

     E + G + H + I = (I+5) + G + H + I  
                   = H + G + 2I + 5

     These must be equal, so

          H + G + 2F + 11 = H + G + 2I + 5
          ⇒  2F + 11 = 2I + 5
          ⇒  F – I = –3
          ⇒  I = F + 3

4.  From the earlier relations we now have

     C = F + 5, I = F + 3, E = F + 8.

     Since each is a digit 0-9, F can only be 0 or 1 (because F+8 ≤ 9).

5.  Case F = 0.

     Then C=5, I=3, E=8.

     B = H+3, J = G+3 with all digits still unused.

     (a)  Take H = 6  (then B = 9).  
          Choose G = 4 (then J = 7) – all digits so far are distinct.  

          Check the product clue:  B·I = 9·3 = 27, so 10A+J = 27 ⇒ A=2, J=7.  
          This matches the chosen J, so the set is consistent.

          The common sum is
              H + G + 2F + 11 = 6 + 4 + 0 + 11 = 21,
          so D = 1.

          Digits obtained:  A=2, B=9, C=5, D=1, E=8, F=0, G=4, H=6, I=3, J=7  
          – exactly the ten different digits 0–9.

     (b)  All other choices for H or G under F=0 fail; F=1 yields no solution at all.

6.  Therefore the unique ten-digit number is

        2 9 5 1 8 0 4 6 3 7.

A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.

Every question we ask is a YES/NO question.

QUESTION 1 (to Alex) :  “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”  
QUESTION 2 (to Alex) :  “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”      (exactly the same question)

Analyse Alex’s two answers.

• If his two answers are different, Alex must be the alternating man (only the alternator can change his truth-value between two identical questions).  
• If the two answers are identical, Alex is one of the consistent men (either the truth-teller or the liar).    
  – Two identical YESes mean Alex is the truth-teller.  
  – Two identical NOs mean Alex is the liar.  

We now decide what to do with our third and last question.

------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1 :  Alex is the alternator  (his two answers differed)

The other two men are the truth-teller and the liar.  
Ask

QUESTION 3 (to Bob) :  “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?”

Because Bob is now known to be consistent, his answer tells us who he is:

• YES  ⇒  Bob tells the truth  ⇒  Bob = truth-teller, Chuck = liar.  
• NO   ⇒  Bob lies            ⇒  Bob = liar,           Chuck = truth-teller.

------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 2 :  Alex is consistent  (his two answers were the same)

So Alex is already identified (truth-teller if he twice said YES, liar if he twice said NO).  
Exactly one of Bob or Chuck is the alternator; the other is the remaining consistent man.  
Ask Alex the following mixed question:

QUESTION 3 (to Alex) :  
     “Is Bob the alternator if and only if you are the truth-teller ?”

Let P be the statement “Bob is the alternator” and R be “Alex is the truth-teller”.  
The question we asked is “P ↔ R”.

• If Alex really is the truth-teller (R is true), the biconditional reduces to P,  
  so Alex answers YES exactly when Bob is the alternator.  

• If Alex is the liar (R is false), the biconditional is equivalent to ¬P.  
  The liar negates this and therefore still answers YES exactly when Bob is the alternator.  

Thus Alex’s third answer is interpreted the same way no matter whether he is the truth-teller or the liar:

• YES  ⇒  Bob = alternator,       Chuck = (whichever consistent role is still unused).  
• NO   ⇒  Bob = remaining consistent man,  Chuck = alternator.

------------------------------------------------------------------
In every possible scenario the three questions classify all three men.

Final answer:  Yes.  Ask Alex “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?” twice; if the answers differ he is the alternator and Bob’s answer to “Is 2 + 2 = 4 ?” shows which of Bob and Chuck is the truth-teller and which the liar.  If Alex’s two answers are the same he is the truth-teller (two YESes) or the liar (two NOs); then ask Alex “Is Bob the alternator iff you are the truth-teller ?”.  His reply identifies whether Bob or Chuck is the alternator, completing the classification.",True

76,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let t be the number of minutes that have elapsed since the faulty clock was started in the 6 o’clock position.

1. Real (correct) hand speeds  
   • Real minute hand: 360° per hour = 6° per minute  
   • Real hour hand   : 30° per hour = 0.5° per minute  

2. Faulty clock speeds (because the hands were interchanged)  
   • Visible “hour” hand (the short one) is on the fast spindle: 6° per minute  
   • Visible “minute” hand (the long one) is on the slow spindle: 0.5° per minute  

3. Initial positions at t = 0  
   • Visible hour hand: 180° (pointing at 6)  
   • Visible minute hand:   0° (pointing at 12)  

4. Positions after t minutes  
   Faulty clock:  
     θ_h(t) = 180° + 6t      (visible hour hand)  
     θ_m(t) =   0° + 0.5t    (visible minute hand)  

   Correct clock (what the hands ought to show):  
     θ_h _real(t) = 180° + 0.5t  
     θ_m _real(t) = 6t  

5. For the clock to show the right time we need both hands in their correct places:

   θ_h(t) ≡ θ_h _real(t) (mod 360°)  
   θ_m(t) ≡ θ_m _real(t) (mod 360°)

   These give
      180 + 6t ≡ 180 + 0.5t (mod 360) ⇒ 5.5t ≡ 0 (mod 360)  
        0.5t  ≡ 6t        (mod 360) ⇒ 5.5t ≡ 0 (mod 360)

   Thus 5.5t must be a multiple of 360°, so the smallest positive t is

         t = 360° / 5.5° per min = 720/11 min
           = 65 5⁄11 min
           = 1 h 5 min 27 3⁄11 s.

6. Therefore, the first time after the start when the clock reads correctly is

   6 : 00 00 + 1 h 5 min 27 3⁄11 s = 7 : 05 27 3⁄11.

8-point throws  
• 5 3 2 1 6 → occurrences 1-1-1-1-1 (no duplicates)  
• 2 2 3 5 1 → occurrences 2-1-1-1 (one single pair)

• 1 2 6 6 6 → occurrences 3-1-1 (three-of-a-kind)  
• 2 2 5 6 6 → occurrences 2-2-1 (two different pairs)

So the rule that fits all the data is:

• If the throw contains at most one duplicated value – i.e. the dice show five different faces or one single pair – you score 8 points.  
• If it contains heavier duplication – two different pairs, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind or five-of-a-kind – you score 6 points.

Now evaluate the new throw 4 3 6 2 6.

Counts: 6 appears twice, the other three faces appear once each.  
That is exactly one pair and no other duplication, so it falls in the “single-pair / mostly different” category.

Therefore it scores 8 points.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?","Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.
So now, knowing that the killer's sister is COUSIN to Bo, Bill's NIECE, and Bob's GRANDDAUGHTER, the killer must be BERNIE.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We can reconstruct the Beem family from the clues.

1.  Mary’s husband is Bob (he is “Grandfather Bob”).  
2.  They have exactly four children (Mary was “mother of four”):
   • May – married to Ben  
   • Robin – married to Mo  
   • Maria – married to Barry  
   • Bill – not married into the family, therefore a blood son

   The four spouses give the four couples required in the note.

3.  Grandchildren (nine in all) distribute to the four couples as follows, satisfying every clue.
   • May & Ben → Missy, Bernie  
   • Robin & Mo → Bart, Buck, Bruce  
   • Maria & Barry → Bo, Molly  
   • Bill & ( wife ) Myra → Brad, Megan  

   All relationships mentioned (brothers Bart-Buck-Bruce, siblings Bo-Molly, cousin relations, etc.) are now correct, and Bill’s brother-in-law is Barry, exactly as Clue 1 states.

4.  Now consider the key statement:  
   “The killer’s sister … talked to her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her blood-uncle Bill.”

   • A granddaughter whose cousin is Bo cannot be Molly (Bo is her brother), cannot be Megan (Bill would be her father, not uncle), and can only be Missy.

86,"During one meeting with a clan of ninjas, it has been noticed that more ninjas have turned up to the meeting than usual. The ninjas realised that these infiltrators must be the enemy of the ninjas (the pirates). Each person dressed as a ninja at the meeting made a statement. The cunning ninjas lied about their fellow ninjas in order to remain secret and told the truth about the pirates. The pirates tried to mock the cunningness by lying about the pirates and telling the truth about the ninjas. From the following statements, can you identify the ninjas and pirates?
Ninja A: Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja B: Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group
Ninja C: Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group
Ninja D: Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group
Ninja E: Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group
Ninja F: Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group
Remember, the ninjas and pirates will lie about individual ninjas or pirates, not groups of ninjas or pirates.","Think about what Ninja A said, first.","Ninja A is a pirate
Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja C is a ninja
Ninja D is a pirate
Ninja E is a pirate
Ninja F is a ninja
Ninja A said that Ninja B is a ninja. This is because Ninja A is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja A told the truth.
Ninja B said that Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja B is a ninja and Ninja C is a ninja, so Ninja B lied.
Ninja C said that Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group. Ninja C is obviously from the same group as Ninja C, so Ninja C lied.
Ninja D said that Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group. Ninja D is a pirate and Ninja A is a pirate so Ninja D lied.
Ninja E said that Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group. Ninja E is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja E told the truth.
Ninja F said that Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja F is a ninja and Ninja E is a pirate, so Ninja F told the truth.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in full:

Assign “ninja” = 1, “pirate” = 0 for every person A-F.

Rule for every statement  
 Truth of the statement = (speaker is ninja) XOR (person spoken about is ninja).  
(This follows because a ninja (1) tells the truth (1) about pirates (0) and lies (0) about ninjas (1), while a pirate (0) does the opposite.)

Identify, for each sentence, who is the person actually being spoken about:

1. A says: “B is a ninja.”  (subject = B)  
2. B says: “C belongs to A’s group.” (subject = C)  
3. C says: “C doesn’t belong to F’s group.” (subject = C)  
4. D says: “A belongs to B’s group.” (subject = A)  
5. E says: “B belongs to C’s group.” (subject = B)  
6. F says: “E belongs to A’s group.” (subject = E)

Translate the content of each sentence into a Boolean value (1 = true, 0 = false) and equate it to “speaker XOR subject”.

(1)  B = A XOR B                                                …(i)  
(2)  (C = A) = B XOR C                                          …(ii)  
(3)  (C ≠ F) = C XOR C = 0   ⇒  C ≠ F must be false ⇒ C = F     …(iii)  
(4)  (A = B) = D XOR A                                          …(iv)  
(5)  (B = C) = E XOR B                                          …(v)  
(6)  (E = A) = F XOR E                                          …(vi)

Solve step-by-step.

From (i): B = A XOR B  ⇒  A must be 0.  (So A is a pirate.)

Plug A = 0 into (ii): (C = 0) = B XOR C  
 • If C = 0, left side 1 ⇒ B = 1.  
 • If C = 1, left side 0 ⇒ ¬B = 0 ⇒ B = 1.  
Thus B = 1 (B is a ninja).

From (iv): (A = B) = 0 = D XOR 0 ⇒ D = 0. (D is a pirate.)

Let C be unknown for the moment; from (iii) we already have F = C.

From (v): (B = C) = (1 = C) = C = E XOR 1 ⇒ E = ¬C.

Insert E = ¬C and F = C into (vi):  
   (E = 0) = ¬E = C XOR E = C XOR ¬C = 1  
So ¬E = 1 ⇒ E = 0. Therefore C = 1 and hence F = 1.

We now have:

A = 0 (pirate)  
B = 1 (ninja)  
C = 1 (ninja)  
D = 0 (pirate)  
E = 0 (pirate)  
F = 1 (ninja)

The six letter code word, <([])>, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?",Attire,Casual and Formal,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step–by–step reasoning  

1.  Write down the five possible letters for every position in the six–symbol code

   1st “< ” → {F, E, C, R, P}  
   2nd “( ” → {N, A, H, O, B}  
   3rd “[ ” → {F, S, E, D, R}  
   4th “] ” → {W, M, J, U, Y}  
   5th “) ” → {T, E, S, A, L}  
   6th “> ” → {E, R, L, K, S}

2.  The fourth position is very restrictive, permitting only W, M, J, U, or Y.  
    Look for ordinary six-letter English words whose fourth letter is one of those five.

3.  Among such words with the allowed first three letters, FORMAL appears:

        F  (in {F,E,C,R,P})  
        O  (in {N,A,H,O,B})

        A  (in {T,E,S,A,L})  
        L  (in {E,R,L,K,S})

    FORMAL fits perfectly.

4.  Search for a six-letter opposite of FORMAL that also respects the letter-lists.  
    CASUAL works:

        C  (in {F,E,C,R,P})

        A  (in {T,E,S,A,L})  
        L  (in {E,R,L,K,S})

5.  Consequently, the code <([])> can be read as either

97,"Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).","Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
98,"Long ago, back before serious illness existed and the new inventions of today, there lived the Handy People. Their height was measured in hands, and they lived long lives.

2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.", it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true,"Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years

Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Har – 14 hands, 110 years

101,"You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.

Inside every pair decide, during the planning session, who will be the
    “same–as’’ player and who will be the “opposite–to’’ player.

At the moment of the shout each person looks only at the colour of the partner’s band:

• the “same–as’’ player guesses that his own band is the same colour as his partner’s;  
• the “opposite–to’’ player guesses that his own band is the opposite colour of his partner’s.

Why this always gives at least one correct guess in every pair  
If the two head-bands in a pair are the same colour, then the “same–as’’ player is right.  
If the two head-bands are of different colours, then the “opposite–to’’ player is right.  
So every pair contributes at least one correct guess.

Therefore at least 250 of the 500 people are certain to guess correctly, no matter how the black and white head-bands are distributed.

Why you can never guarantee more than 250 correct guesses  
Fix any deterministic strategy.  
For a particular person, keep all the other 499 bands fixed; that person sees the same
scene whether his own band is black or white, yet he can name only one colour.
Hence, for each of the 2 possible colours of his own band, he can be correct in at most one.
Consequently, out of the 2·2^499 = 2^500 possible full colourings, this person is correct in at most 2^499 of them—only half.
Summing over all 500 people, the average number of correct guesses over all 2^500 colourings is at most  
 500·2^499 / 2^500 = 250.  
If a strategy could guarantee 251 correct guesses in every colouring, the average would have to be at least 251, contradicting the bound we just found.
So no strategy can force more than 250 correct guesses in every possible assignment.

Combining the lower and upper bounds, 250 is the best that can be guaranteed.

There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.

Then flip over all 128. That group of 128 and the group of all the remaining pennies will have the same number of heads facing up.
This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1. While blindfolded, pick any 128 pennies from the table and set them aside.

   • The rest of the pennies form pile B.

2. Still blindfolded, flip every penny in pile A over (head → tail, tail → head).

That’s all.

Why it works  
• Suppose pile A originally contained h heads.  
• Because there are 128 heads in total, pile B originally contains 128 − h heads.  

• Flipping pile A turns each of its h heads into tails, and its 128 − h tails into heads.  
  So after flipping, pile A now has 128 − h heads.

• Pile B was never touched, so it still has 128 − h heads.

104,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.

(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

 3·9 = 27   (2 , 7)     14   ✓
 4·7 = 28   (2 , 8)     16   ✓
 4·9 = 36   (3 , 6)     18   ✓
 6·8 = 48   (4 , 8)     32   ✗  (H duplicates G)

 7·8 = 56   (5 , 6)     30   ✗  (I would be 0)
 7·9 = 63   (6 , 3)     18   ✗
 8·9 = 72   (7 , 2)     14   ✓

The surviving possibilities are therefore

(A) D·G = 27  (B=2, H=7)  
(B) D·G = 28  (B=2, H=8)  
(C) D·G = 36  (B=3, H=6)  
(D) D·G = 72  (B=7, H=2)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Test each survivor with equation (4)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (4):  G·I = 10C + F,  so the units digit of G·I must be F and the tens digit C.
Recall I is already the units digit of B·H found in Step 1.

For each survivor compute I and then G·I.

(A)  D·G=27 ⇒ (B,H)=(2,7) ⇒ B·H=14 ⇒ I=4  
     If G=9: 9·4 = 36 ⇒ C=3, F=6  (C duplicates D) ❌  
     If G=3: 3·4 = 12 ⇒ C=1, F=2  (C duplicates J later) ❌

(B)  D·G=28 ⇒ (B,H)=(2,8) ⇒ I=6  
     If G=7: 7·6 = 42 ⇒ C=4, F=2  (C duplicates B) ❌  
     If G=4: 4·6 = 24 ⇒ C=2, F=4  (C duplicates B, F duplicates G) ❌

(C)  D·G=36 ⇒ (B,H)=(3,6) ⇒ I=8  
     If G=9: 9·8 = 72 ⇒ C=7, F=2  (A·F impossible, see next step) ❌  
     If G=4: 4·8 = 32 ⇒ C=3, F=2  (C duplicates B) ❌

(D)  D·G=72 ⇒ (B,H)=(7,2) ⇒ I=4  
     Choose G=9, D=8 (G must differ from H)  
     9·4 = 36 ⇒ C=3, F=6   (all digits still unique!) ✔

All other arrangements fail; only case (D) survives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Satisfy equation (1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
We now have

B=7, H=2, I=4, J=1, C=3, F=6, D=8, G=9

Equation (1):  A·F = 10C + E  
               A·6 = 30 + E

Because 1 ≤ A ≤ 9, A·6 can be 30, 36, 42, 48, or 54.  
But the left side must begin with the tens digit C = 3, so A·6 must be 30 or 36.

• If A = 5,  A·6 = 30 ⇒ E = 0, and 0 has not been used yet.  
• If A = 6,  A·6 = 36 ⇒ E = 6, which repeats the digit F.  Impossible.

Hence A = 5 and E = 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – Collect the digits
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A = 5  
B = 7  
C = 3  
D = 8  
E = 0  
F = 6  
G = 9  
H = 2  
I = 4  
J = 1

Every digit 0–9 appears exactly once and all four equations hold:

5·6 = 30  → CE = 30 ✓  
7·2 = 14  → JI = 14 ✓  
8·9 = 72  → BH = 72 ✓  
9·4 = 36  → CF = 36 ✓

108,"In the legendary land of MADADIA,  Stu Pidfule, the inventor of dehydrated water, died in a freak Kebab wrestling accident. In his will, he left a provision of money to each of his three children, Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy. Derek invested his money wisely. Eric spent his money wildly. Monkeyboy spent all his on some magic beans that didn't grow. Stu Pidfule had been determined to treat each child equally, and in a way he did, even though Derek, Eric and Monkeyboy all got different amounts.
How could this be?",,He had left each of them the same thing. An amount equal to one year of their annual salary.

 10C + D = 27  → 3·27 = 81 ⇒ A = 8, J = 1

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step  

1. The dog has two possible actions:  
  E = eat the flower.  
  N = do not eat the flower.

2. The flower decides, before the dog acts, whether or not to develop poison:  
  P = produce poison.  
  NP = do not produce poison.  
 The dog cannot see this decision.

3. Pay-offs for the dog  
  • If it eats a non-poisonous flower → dog certainly lives.  
  • If it eats a poisonous flower   → dog certainly dies.  
  • If it does not eat        → dog lives with probability ½.  
 So for the dog, “eat” is better than “do not eat” only when it assigns to P a probability strictly below ½.

4. Pay-offs for the flower  
  • If the dog does not eat it → flower survives and, if it made no poison, it avoids the unpleasant work.  
  • If the dog will eat it and it has no poison → flower certainly dies.  
  • If the dog will eat it and it has poison  → dog dies quickly and the flower survives.  
 Producing poison is tiresome, so the flower will do it only when that is necessary to avoid being eaten, but whenever its life is at stake it will certainly make the poison (assumption 6 is explicit about this).

5. What happens if the dog plans to eat?  
 Because the flower is perfectly rational and knows the dog’s plan, it realises that its life is in danger and therefore it surely chooses P.  
 Hence, if the dog chooses E, the probability that the flower is poisonous is 1, so the dog’s chance of survival is 0.

6. What happens if the dog plans not to eat?  
 Knowing it is safe, the flower gains nothing by producing poison, so it chooses NP.  
 The dog’s chance of survival is then the uninfluenced ½.

7. The dog now compares the two possibilities that its own reasoning has produced:  
  Eat → survival probability = 0.  
  Not → survival probability = ½.  
 Because ½ > 0, the rational dog chooses not to eat the flower.

8. Once the dog has settled on N, the flower, seeing that it will not be attacked, does not waste the effort of producing poison.

Conclusion  
The only rational course for the dog is to leave the flower alone; it will accept the external 50 % risk rather than face certain death.

Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

t  = the real time (in minutes after 12 : 00) when Little Mad Ade leaves home.  
tₘ = the time he THINKS he sees, i.e. the mirror image of t.

1. Mirror–image relation  
For an ordinary 12-hour clock, a perfect left-right mirror turns every time t into  
tₘ = 720 min − t.  
(Example: 3 : 00 → 9 : 00 because 720 − 180 = 540 min = 9 : 00.)

2. Relation produced by the ride  
He reaches school 20 min later, so the real time on arrival is t + 20.

3. What the school clock shows  
That clock shows a time 2½ h = 150 min later than the time he thought he saw, i.e.  
t + 20 = tₘ + 150.

4. Put the two equations together  
t + 20 = (720 − t) + 150

Arrival = t + 20 = 7 : 05 + 0 : 20 = 7 : 25 a.m.

Check:

The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).

115,"One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?",,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Observing the game we notice the rule that every time someone is tapped

• he (or she) later gives back exactly the same number of taps  
• to the person who tapped him and to everyone that person had already tapped,  
• except himself (and, of course, the RELIGIOUS FIGURES never give any taps at all).

Thus no new names can ever be introduced after the first time someone taps: every subsequent tap is always directed only to people that have already appeared in somebody’s earlier “tap‐list”.  

Looking at the initial lists supplied by the Stooges, the Kings and the two Queens we see that the only names that ever appear are

Moe, Larry, Curly, James, Saul, Henry, Pope, Gandhi, Victoria, Elizabeth.

Neither Mother Teresa nor Candace ever occurs in any tapper’s list, and—because of the rule above—they never can occur later.  
Since Religious Figures never tap anyone, Mother Teresa can never receive a tap from within her own group, and no one outside her group will ever add her name spontaneously.  
Candace is in the same situation: no one has tapped her, so her name is not in anyone’s list, hence no future tapper will be allowed to touch her.

Therefore the only people who will remain forever untapped are

Mother Teresa and Candace.

Final answer: Mother Teresa and Candace",True
116,"Four members of the Madadian pro-celebrity Kebab wrestling team took part in a charity pool match to raise money for new spandex sequined grease proof leotards
Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff and Hayden Seek participated in the POOL competition.
FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

A = Al Gore-Rhythm  
B = Annie Buddyhome  
D = Dan Druff  
H = Hayden Seek  

For every game 15 balls are on the table, so the two scores in a game always add to 15.

Label the six games and the points each player scores in them:

AB : A₁ , B₁  (A₁ + B₁ = 15)  
AD : A₂ , D₂  (A₂ + D₂ = 15)  
AH : A₃ , H₁  (A₃ + H₁ = 15)  
BD : B₂ , D₃  (B₂ + D₃ = 15)  
BH : B₃ , H₂  (B₃ + H₂ = 15)  
DH : D₄ , H₃  (D₄ + H₃ = 15)

Write the tournament totals:

A_total = A₁ + A₂ + A₃  
B_total = B₁ + B₂ + B₃  
D_total = D₂ + D₃ + D₄  
H_total = H₁ + H₂ + H₃

Now impose the given outcomes one by one.

1. H_total = 18  
   H₁ + H₂ + H₃ = 18.

2. A_total is odd. (Keep for later.)

3. Dan beat Hayden by 5 in their game DH: D₄ = H₃ + 5.  
   With D₄ + H₃ = 15, this gives  

  H₃ = 5 , D₄ = 10.

4. AB was decided by one point: |A₁ – B₁| = 1.

5. In AD, Al scored twice Dan: A₂ = 2 D₂ and A₂ + D₂ = 15 →

From A₂ = 2 D₂: 3 D₂ = 15 → D₂ = 5 , A₂ = 10.

6. Hayden scored one less v Al than v Dan: H₁ = H₃ – 1 = 5 – 1 = 4.  
   Therefore in AH A₃ = 15 – H₁ = 11.

7. Dan scored 7 against Annie: D₃ = 7 → B₂ = 15 – 7 = 8.

At this point every per-game score except the AB and BH games is fixed:

AD : 10–5  AH : 11–4  DH : 10–5  
BD : 8–7

Work out BH from Hayden’s total.  
H₁ + H₂ + H₃ = 4 + H₂ + 5 = 18 ⇒ H₂ = 9.  
So BH : 6–9 (because B₃ + 9 = 15 gives B₃ = 6).

Finally, solve the AB game.  
B so far has 8 + 6 = 14 points from BD and BH, so

 B_total = B₁ + 14.  
Al so far has 10 + 11 = 21 points from AD and AH, so

 A_total = A₁ + 21.

Because A₁ + B₁ = 15 and |A₁ – B₁| = 1, the only possibilities are
 (A₁ , B₁) = (8, 7) or (7, 8).

Take each in turn:

(A₁ , B₁) = (7, 8) → A_total = 28 (even) – violates condition 2.  
(A₁ , B₁) = (8, 7) → A_total = 29 (odd) – acceptable.

Thus AB was 8–7 in Al’s favour, and all conditions are satisfied.

Totals:

Al Gore-Rhythm 29  
Dan Druff   22  
Annie Buddyhome 21  
Hayden Seek  18

Winner: Al Gore-Rhythm with 29 points.

119,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?",,"Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.  There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.  Namely, for (Snap, Crackle, Pop) they are:
(1, 7, 6)
(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.
And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1 – What Snap’s remark tells us  
Snap saw his own number s and was immediately sure that Crackle’s and Pop’s numbers were different.  
The only way the other two envelopes could contain equal numbers is if their total 14-s were split into two equal halves, i.e. if 14-s were even.  
Since Snap is certain equality is impossible, 14-s must be odd ⇒ s is odd.

Step 2 – What Crackle’s remark tells us  
Crackle, before Snap spoke, already knew that all three numbers were different.  
Let Crackle’s number be c; then Snap and Pop must add to 14-c.

• If c were even, 14-c would also be even and the two unknown envelopes could each have value (14-c)/2, making them equal – Crackle could not rule that out.  
⇒ c cannot be even; c is odd.

• If c ≤ 6 then one of the other envelopes could equal c itself (because 14-2c would still be a positive integer).  
⇒ To rule this out Crackle must have c > 6.

The odd numbers > 6 and still small enough to leave something for the others are 7, 9, 11.  
So Gretchen (and Pop) now know Crackle’s number is in {7, 9, 11}.

Step 3 – Listing the still-possible triples  
Use s odd, c ∈ {7, 9, 11}, all positive and different, s + c + p = 14.

c = 7  → s + p = 7  
 s = 1 ⇒ p = 6  (s, c, p) = (1,7,6)  
 s = 3 ⇒ p = 4  (s, c, p) = (3,7,4)  
 s = 5 ⇒ p = 2  (s, c, p) = (5,7,2)

c = 9  → s + p = 5  
 s = 1 ⇒ p = 4  (s, c, p) = (1,9,4)  
 s = 3 ⇒ p = 2  (s, c, p) = (3,9,2)

c = 11 → s + p = 3  
 s = 1 ⇒ p = 2  (s, c, p) = (1,11,2)

These are the only six triples still possible after Snap’s and Crackle’s remarks.

Step 4 – What Pop’s remark tells us  
Pop sees his own number p and, using the above information, is able to identify the whole triple uniquely.

Check each p that appears in the list:

p = 2 → could pair with (c,s) = (7,5) or (9,3) or (11,1)  (3 possibilities)  
p = 4 → could pair with (c,s) = (7,3) or (9,1)      (2 possibilities)  
p = 6 → only possible with (c,s) = (7,1)          (1 possibility)

For Pop to be able to say “Now I know all three numbers,” his envelope must contain 6.  
Hence p = 6, and the only compatible triple is

Snap s = 1  
Crackle c = 7  
Pop   p = 6

Step 5 – Gretchen’s deduction  
Gretchen heard exactly what we did and performed the same elimination.  
Seeing that Pop’s statement fixes his number at 6 and forces the unique triple (1, 7, 6), she could raise her hand and give the three numbers with certainty.

Final answer: Snap has 1, Crackle has 7, Pop has 6.",True

123,"In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?",,"Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1.  While he is still inside he notices that every saw is running and therefore that every outside back-up switch must be ON.  
   He now leaves the room; from this moment on he can use only the four back-up switches.

2.  Outside he does the following time-schedule with the four switches (the exact minutes are not important – only that the periods are clearly different).

   • Turn every switch OFF and wait until every saw has stopped and all motors start to cool.  
   • Turn switch 1 ON, let it run 6 minutes, then turn it OFF again.  
   • Turn switch 2 ON, let it run 4 minutes, then turn it OFF again.  
   • Turn switch 3 ON, let it run 2 minutes, then turn it OFF again.  
   • Turn switch 4 ON and, without waiting, walk straight back into the machine room.

3.  What he finds inside:

   • One saw is still running – that saw is powered through switch 4 (the only switch that is still ON).  
   • Of the three saws that are standing still, their motors are at three distinctly different temperatures:  
     – the hottest one ran 6 minutes ago → switch 1,  
     – the next warm one ran 4 minutes ago → switch 2,  
     – the coolest one stopped 2 minutes ago → switch 3.

4.  Thus each machine is identified uniquely:

   running → switch 4  
   hottest stopped → switch 1  
   warm stopped → switch 2  
   coolest stopped → switch 3

Because the brother himself chose the order and the running times, he now knows exactly which outside back-up switch belongs to which saw.

Final answer: He uses the fact that a motor that has been running different lengths of time stays hot for different lengths of time. By letting one switch run continuously, another run a long time and cool a little, another run a shorter time and cool more, and the last not run at all, he produces four distinguishable conditions (running, hot, warm, cold). When he re-enters the room he matches those four conditions to the four time-patterns he created, thereby identifying every switch with its correct machine.",True
124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second. The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
125,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:

A.  (Fu , Cq , Ek , Io) = (0,1,1,1)    N = 3  
B.  (Fu , Cq , Ek , Io) = (1,0,0,0)    N = 2

Case B soon forces impossible equalities, so only Case A survives.

Case A: Av=1, Fu=0, Cq=1, Ek=1, Io=1, N=3  
From (4)  2 – Bw + Io + Cq + Hp = 3 ⇒ Hp – Bw = –1 ⇒ Hp = 0, Bw = 1  
From (5)  (1–Bw)+(1–Io)+(1–Jr)+Lx+Dm = 3 ⇒ Jr=0, Lx=1, Dm=1

So the definite password letters are

A  B  C  D  E  I  L  P  R  U

while the three pairs G–N, S–T, Y–Z are still undecided.

Remember how the password is read: write the 13 “other” letters alphabetically and underneath each write its paired password letter.  
With the current choices the “other” letters already fixed are  

F  H  J  K  M  O  Q  V  W  X

If the remaining “other” letters are chosen as G, S, Z (so N, T, Y are in the password) the 13 “other” letters, in order, are

F  G  H  J  K  M  O  Q  S  V  W  X  Z

126,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.",,"The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.

Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all.

129,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the four weights (in ascending order) be  

w₁ ≤ w₂ ≤ w₃ ≤ w₄ .

Because a two–pan balance may have weights placed on either side, every weight can be used with the coefficients –1, 0, or +1.  
Suppose that with the first k weights we can already weigh every integer number of ounces from 1 up to Sₖ (inclusive).  
Now we add the next heavier weight w_{k+1}.  

• The smallest new positive weight we could need to make is Sₖ + 1.  
• Putting w_{k+1} on the same side as the gold makes the balance heavier by w_{k+1}; putting it on the opposite side makes the balance lighter by w_{k+1}.  
• Thus the largest “gap” we can cover with the new weight is 2Sₖ + 1   (because we can offset as much as Sₖ with the old weights and gain or lose another w_{k+1}).  

Therefore, to avoid a gap at Sₖ + 1 we must have  

w_{k+1} ≤ 2Sₖ + 1.                             (★)

To maximise the final reach we always choose equality in (★).

Start the construction:

1. With no weights we can weigh nothing, so S₀ = 0.  
   From (★): w₁ ≤ 2·0 + 1 = 1  ⇒  w₁ = 1.  
   Now S₁ = 1.

2. With S₁ = 1:  w₂ ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3  ⇒  w₂ = 3.  
   Now S₂ = 1 + 3 = 4.

3. With S₂ = 4:  w₃ ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9  ⇒  w₃ = 9.  
   Now S₃ = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.

4. With S₃ = 13: w₄ ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27 ⇒ w₄ = 27.  
   Now S₄ = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.

Thus with the four weights 1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, 27 oz the assessor can measure every integer quantity from 1 oz up to 40 oz. 

It is impossible to reach 41 oz: even if w₄ were as large as allowed (27 oz), the greatest total offset achievable is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 oz, so 41 oz cannot be balanced.

Hence the largest number of ounces that can be measured exactly with four weights is 40.

The four letter code word, 6@&^, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?",,East and West.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We have to assign a letter to each symbol in the 4-symbol code 6@&^.  
Allowed letters for each position are  

6 → {L, E, P, W, T}  
@ → {E, C, O, N, A}  
& → {E, S, B, R, G}  
^ → {N, H, A, T, K}

We need two different assignments that produce two ordinary four-letter English words which are antonyms.

Try the pair EAST / WEST (opposite cardinal directions):

EAST: 6 = E, @ = A, & = S, ^ = T  
• E is allowed for 6  
• A is allowed for @  
• S is allowed for &  
• T is allowed for ^  
So EAST fits.

WEST: 6 = W, @ = E, & = S, ^ = T  
• W is allowed for 6  
• E is allowed for @  
• S is allowed for &  
• T is allowed for ^  
So WEST also fits.

Since EAST and WEST are opposite directions, the requirement is satisfied.

132,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?",,"If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8
5+7
Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.
Thus the only remaining solution is: houses 4 and 8.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We label the ten houses 1–10.

1.  Each working day Patel visited 4 houses, and in the whole week he made  
   6 days × 4 houses = 24 deliveries.

2.  Exactly 8 houses received mail, each of them exactly 3 times, because  
   8 houses × 3 deliveries = 24.

3.  Add the six daily totals:  
   18+12+23+19+32+25 = 129.  
   These 129 are the sum of the 24 delivered house-numbers, i.e. three times the
   sum S of the 8 houses that were actually visited: 3 S = 129 ⇒ S = 43.

4.  The sum of all ten house numbers is 1+2+…+10 = 55.  
   Therefore the two houses that never received mail add to  
   55−43 = 12.

5.  The only pairs of distinct house numbers that sum to 12 are  
   {2,10}, {3,9}, {4,8}, {5,7}.  
   For each pair we ask whether one can get a daily total of 32
   from four distinct visited houses:

      • If {2,10} were missing, the largest four visited numbers would be  
        9+8+7+6 = 30 < 32 ⇒ impossible.  
      • If {3,9} were missing, the largest four would be  
        10+8+7+6 = 31 < 32 ⇒ impossible.  
      • If {5,7} were missing, no 4-number subset of the remaining houses
        sums to 32 (maximum is 10+9+8+6 = 33, but 32 cannot be hit).  
      • If {4,8} are missing, the visited set is  
        {1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10}.  
        Here 10+9+7+6 = 32, so the daily total 32 is feasible.

   Hence the only possible absent pair is {4, 8}.

6.  One explicit schedule proving consistency is:

      Monday (18): 9 + 5 + 3 + 1  
      Tuesday (12): 6 + 3 + 2 + 1  
      Wednesday (23): 10 + 7 + 5 + 1  
      Thursday (19): 9 + 5 + 3 + 2  
      Friday (32): 10 + 9 + 7 + 6  
      Saturday (25): 10 + 7 + 6 + 2  

   Each of the eight houses 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10 appears exactly three times,
   and all daily sums match the given ones.

Therefore houses 4 and 8 are the ones that received no mail.

Final answer: Houses 4 and 8 received no mail.",True

1. At the time of the murder, a man and a woman were at the store together, the murderer and the victim were at the park together, and one of Heather's two children was at home alone.
2. Heather and her husband were apart at the time of the murder.
3. The victim's sibling is not the murderer.
4. The murderer is younger than the victim.
Who was murdered?",,"Heather's brother was murdered.
From facts 1 and 2, Heather and her husband were at the store and the park, in some order. Suppose Heather was at the park. Then, from fact 1, Heather's husband and their daughter were at the store, their son was at home, and Heather and her brother were at the park, which means that one of Heather and her brother must have killed the other. But, from fact 3, this cannot work, which means that Heather was at the store.
Suppose the man at the store with Heather was her brother. Then her husband was at the park with one of the two children. Since the husband is obviously older than the children, fact 4 tells us that he could not have killed them. But since he doesn't have a sibling who lives with him, fact 3 tells us he can't be the victim either.
This means that Heather and her son were at the store, her daughter was at home, and Heather's husband and brother were at the park. Again, from fact 3, the husband could not have been the victim, which means that he was the murderer and the brother was the victim.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step

1.  The five family members  
   • Heather – an adult woman  
   • Heather’s husband – an adult man  
   • Heather’s brother – an adult man  
   • Son – a boy  
   • Daughter – a girl  

   (Only the first three are “man/woman”; the two children are “boy/girl”.)

2.  Statement-1 puts the five people in three places at the moment of the crime  
        STORE : a man and a woman  
        HOME  : one of the two children, alone  
        PARK  : the murderer and the victim  

3.  Statement-2 says Heather and her husband were not together, so they cannot be the pair at the same place.

4.  Heather cannot be the child who is home alone, so she must be either at the store or at the park.  
    • If Heather were at the park, the woman at the store would have to be her daughter, who is a girl, not a woman – impossible.  
      Therefore Heather is at the STORE.

5.  The man who is with Heather at the store cannot be her husband (they must be apart), and he must be an adult (“man”).  
    The only possible man is Heather’s brother.  
        STORE : Heather (woman) + Brother (man)

6.  The remaining three people are Husband, Son, Daughter.  
    One child is home alone, the other two people are together at the park.

   Two sub-cases:

   a) Daughter home alone → PARK: Husband + Son  
      • Murderer must be younger than victim (Statement-4); the son is younger than his father, the reverse is impossible.  
        So Son murdered Husband.  
      • Victim’s sibling is not the murderer (Statement-3); the husband’s siblings are not present, so the rule is satisfied.

   b) Son home alone → PARK: Husband + Daughter  
      • By the same age argument, Daughter murdered Husband, and Statement-3 is again satisfied.

   In every allowed arrangement the person who dies is Heather’s husband.

7.  No other placement of people satisfies all four statements, so the victim is uniquely determined even though the murderer could be either child.

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".

If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning:

1.  From clue #1, “Sense of Hume-or”, Alex’s chapter, and “Descartes Before DesHorse” are three consecutive chapters in that order.  
   ⇒ Alex’s chapter can be #2, #3 or #4.

2.  From clue #3, “Freudian Slippers” is three chapters before Kiera’s.  
   ⇒ “Freudian Slippers” can be chapter 1 (→ Kiera 4) or chapter 2 (→ Kiera 5).

3.  Try Alex = 2: forces “Sense” = 1 and “Descartes” = 3.

5.  Therefore Alex = 4: “Sense” = 3, “Descartes” = 5.

140,"8 friends decided to play in a pool tournament.  They played a single elimination tournament, with three rounds (the first round, second round, and finals).  Using the clues below can you determine who beat whom in each round?
Boys:  Jack, Jamie, Jim, Roger, Tommy
Girls:  Jessica, Renee, Tina
Clues:
1.  No one ever played against someone else with the same first name initial.
2.  The four people who advanced to the second round were Renee, the person who beat Tina in the first round, the loser of the final match, and the man who played Jessica in the first round.
3.  3 games of the first round, and 1 game of the second round were played by two people of the opposite sex.
4.  Jack only played against a man one time in the tournament, and Roger played against a man in every round he played in.
5.  Renee played against Jack at some point in the tournament.
6.  The two people who played in the final round were the winner, and the man who beat Tommy in the 2nd round.

8.  Jessica did not play against the eventual champion.",,"First Round:

Jim vs. Roger, Roger won
Second Round:

Finals:
Jack vs. Roger, Jack won",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let us label the 8 players

Boys:  Jack (Jk), Jamie (Ja), Jim (Ji), Roger (R), Tommy (T)  
Girls: Jessica (Je), Renee (Re), Tina (Ti)

Step-1.  The quarter-final (first) round must contain 3 mixed-sex games and 1 same-sex game (clue 3).  
Because there are exactly 3 girls, each girl must meet a boy and the remaining game is boy-vs-boy.

Step-2.  The four semi-finalists are (clue 2)  
 • Renee,  
 • the person who beats Tina,  
 • the loser of the final,  
 • the man who plays Jessica.  
Hence these four people are distinct.

Step-3.  Roger always plays a man (clue 4), so Roger must be in the only boy-vs-boy game of the first round.  
Jim always plays men (clue 7), so Jim must be Roger’s opponent in that game:

 Game D  Roger vs Jim.

Step-4.  The man who plays Jessica (and beats her—otherwise he could not reach the semi-finals) is either Roger or Tommy, because Jack, Jamie and Jim all have the same initial “J” as Jessica and clue 1 forbids such match-ups.  
Roger is already in game D, so Jessica’s opponent must be Tommy:

 Game B  Tommy defeats Jessica.

Step-5.  Tina cannot play Tommy (same initial “T”), so the boy who beats Tina is Jack or Jamie.  
Renee cannot face Roger (same initial “R”), so her first-round opponent is the remaining boy of {Jack, Jamie}.  
Thus the first-round games are forced to be

 Game A  Jack defeats Tina.  
 Game B  Tommy defeats Jessica.  
 Game C  Renee defeats Jamie.  
 Game D  Jim defeats Roger.

Step-6.  The winners reach the semi-finals: Jack, Tommy, Renee, Jim.  
Exactly one semi-final must be mixed-sex (clue 3).  Pairing

 Semi-1  Jack (M) vs Renee (F) – mixed-sex  
 Semi-2  Jim (M)  vs Tommy (M) – same-sex

satisfies this.

Step-7.  Tommy must lose in the second round to a man who will be in the final (clue 6).  
Therefore Jim defeats Tommy in Semi-2 and Jim reaches the final.

Step-8.  Renee must meet Jack somewhere (clue 5); that occurs in Semi-1, where Jack defeats Renee.

Step-9.  Now the final is Jack versus Jim.  Jack cannot face men more than once in the whole tournament (clue 4).  
So far Jack’s only male opponent is Jim in the final (first round he played Tina, second round Renee).  
Hence Jack may indeed face Jim in the final and still satisfy clue 4.

Step-10.  Jessica must not meet the eventual champion (clue 8); she lost to Tommy in the first round, and Jack is champion, so the condition is satisfied if Jack wins the final.

All clues are now met consistently.

Therefore the complete tournament is

Quarter-finals  
 Jack beat Tina.  
 Tommy beat Jessica.  
 Renee beat Jamie.  
 Jim beat Roger.

Semi-finals  
 Jack beat Renee.  
 Jim beat Tommy.

Final  
 Jack beat Jim and became the champion.

Final answer: 
Quarter-finals – Jack > Tina, Tommy > Jessica, Renee > Jamie, Jim > Roger;  
Semi-finals – Jack > Renee, Jim > Tommy;  
Final – Jack beats Jim (Jack is the champion).",True

Nobody tells them which dish corresponds to each letter and so they each select one letter without knowing what they will eat. The innkeeper arrives with the five dishes ordered and puts them in the center of the table so that they can decide who eats what. This goes on for two more nights. The foreigners, who are professors of logic, were able to deduce by the dishes they ordered which letter represents what dish. What could have been the dishes ordered each of the three nights? Note: Each dish was ordered at least once.",,"They could have ordered ABCDD their first night (finding out what D is), AEFGG the second night (finding out what G is and what A is, since they had ordered it the previous night too), and BEHII the third night (finding out what I, B and E are). This leaves C, F and H out, and since they had never ordered these dishes twice, and each came out on a different night, they should know what they are.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"One possible set of orders that lets the five professors determine the whole correspondence after the third dinner is  

Night 1 : A , A , D , E , G  
Night 2 : B , B , D , F , H  
Night 3 : C , C , E , F , I  

Why this works  

1.  Counting, not just noting presence, gives information.  
    –  The diners know exactly how many times every letter is ordered each night (they ordered the letters themselves).  
    –  They also see exactly how many plates of every dish appear each night.

2.  Give every letter a different “count-pattern’’ (number of times it occurs on each of the three nights).  
    The nine letters receive the nine distinct triples  

    A → (2,0,0)  G → (1,0,0)  
    B → (0,2,0)  H → (0,1,0)  
    C → (0,0,2)  I → (0,0,1)  
    D → (1,1,0)  
    E → (1,0,1)  
    F → (0,1,1)

3.  Arrange the orders so that those very patterns are produced.  
    The orders written above do exactly that:  
      • night 1 supplies 5 letters whose multiplicities are 2+1+1+1 = 5,  
      • night 2 again gives 2+1+1+1 = 5,  
      • night 3 again gives 2+1+1+1 = 5,  
      and every one of the nine letters appears at least once.

4.  After the third evening the professors list, for every dish actually served, the triple  
    (how many plates they saw of it on night 1, on night 2, on night 3).  
    Those nine triples are exactly the nine triples attached to the letters above, and every triple is different; hence each letter can be matched to one and only one dish, giving the complete and unique correspondence.

Thus the three nights of orders shown let them deduce without doubt which letter names which dish.

The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","The number of Chidam's license plate is 10968, which is 89601 when inverted.  That is 78633 more than the original number.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Write the 5–digit plate number as  
N = A B C D E, with A the ten-thousands digit and E the units digit.

After turning the plate upside–down we
1. reverse the order of the digits,
2. replace each digit by its 180° rotation

         0 ↔ 0 , 1 ↔ 1 , 6 ↔ 9 , 8 ↔ 8 , 9 ↔ 6 .

Hence the “upside-down” number is  

N′ = f(E) f(D) f(C) f(B) f(A)  
where f is the above flip map.

We are told that  
N′ = N + 78 633.                             (1)

Translate (1) into contributions of each digit (place-value 10⁴,10³,10²,10¹,10⁰):

Δ = N′ – N
   = (10⁴f(E) – E)  + (10³f(D) – 10D) + 100(f(C) – C)
     + (10f(B) – 1000B) + (f(A) – 10⁴A)
   = 78 633.                             (2)

Compute the possible contributions for every allowed digit:

E-term 10⁴f(E) – E : 0, 9 999, 59 991, 79 992, 89 994  
A-term f(A) – 10⁴A : –9 999, –59 991, –79 992, –89 994  
D-term 10³f(D) – 10D: 0, 990, 5 910, 7 920, 8 940  
C-term 100(f(C) – C): –300, 0, 300  
B-term 10f(B) – 1000B: 0, –990, –5 910, –7 920, –8 940.

We need their sum to be 78 633.

Try E = 8 → first term 79 992.  
If we choose A = 1 (second term –9 999) then  
79 992 – 9 999 = 69 993.  
We still need 78 633 – 69 993 = 8 640 from the middle three terms.

Take D = 6 → +8 940.  
Then we require the last two terms to contribute –300.

Choose C = 9 → –300, B = 0 → 0. Perfect.

Thus the only consistent digit choice is  

A = 1, B = 0, C = 9, D = 6, E = 8.

So

N = 1 0 9 6 8 = 10 968, 
N′ = 8 9 6 0 1 = 89 601,

From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.

The three statements are logical implications; each one is false only when its
antecedent is true and its consequent is false.

1. “If n is a multiple of 3, then 50 ≤ n ≤ 59.”
   • This fails only when n is divisible by 3 but n ∉ [50, 59].

2. “If n is not a multiple of 4, then 60 ≤ n ≤ 69.”
   • This fails only when n is NOT divisible by 4 but n ∉ [60, 69].

3. “If n is not a multiple of 6, then 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.”
   • This fails only when n is NOT divisible by 6 but n ∉ [70, 79].

A convenient way to satisfy an implication is to make its antecedent false.
We look for a pattern of divisibilities that keeps every implication true.

• If n were outside the three quoted intervals (50-79), then  
  – To keep (1) true n would have to be NOT divisible by 3.  
  – To keep (2) true n would have to be divisible by 4.  
  – To keep (3) true n would have to be divisible by 6 (so its antecedent is
    false).  
  But a number divisible by 6 is automatically divisible by 3, contradicting
  the first requirement.  
  Hence n must lie inside at least one of the three intervals 50-79.

Observe the conflicts among the consequents:
• The sets 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 are disjoint.
• Therefore two different antecedents cannot be simultaneously true, otherwise
  n would have to belong to two different disjoint intervals.

Thus we need exactly one antecedent to be true, the other two false.

Case analysis
A) Make only antecedent (1) true:  
   n must be divisible by 3, divisible by 4 (so antecedent 2 is false) and
   divisible by 6 (so antecedent 3 is false).  
   That means n is a multiple of 12 lying in 50-59.  No such number exists.

B) Make only antecedent (2) true:  
   Then n is NOT divisible by 4, but must be divisible by 6 (to falsify
   antecedent 3) and simultaneously NOT divisible by 3 (to falsify
   antecedent 1).  Impossible (a multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3).

C) Make only antecedent (3) true:  
   Then n is NOT divisible by 6, so it must lie in 70-79.  
   To keep antecedent 2 false, let n be divisible by 4.  
   Also, let n NOT be divisible by 3 to keep antecedent 1 false.

   Numbers in 70-79 divisible by 4 are 72 and 76.
   – 72 is divisible by 3 ⇒ antecedent 1 would be true as well (forbidden).
   – 76 is not divisible by 3 ⇒ antecedent 1 remains false.

   Hence n = 76 satisfies all requirements:

   • 76 mod 3 = 1  → antecedent 1 false → statement 1 true.  
   • 76 mod 4 = 0  → antecedent 2 false → statement 2 true.  
   • 76 mod 6 = 4  → antecedent 3 true, and 76 ∈ [70,79] → statement 3 true.

Therefore 76 is the unique house number that makes all three statements true.

148,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

Room B: large, borders rooms A, C, D, and E
Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?",,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.
Room B: Son
Room C: Sister
Room D: Daughter
Room E: Mother
2.
Room A: Sister
Room B: Son
Room C: HEF Jr.
Room D: Mother
Room E: Daughter
In either scenario, the mother's and the sister's rooms are the same size. And from fact 2, the sister is the lead.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Characters and sexes  
   • Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr. (Hans) – man  
   • Hans’s sister – woman  
   • Hans’s mother – woman  
   • Hans’s son – man  
   • Hans’s daughter – woman  
   So there are 2 men and 3 women.

2.  Rooms (size / number of bordering rooms)  
   A – small / 2   C – large / 2  
   B – large / 4   D – small / 3  
   E – large / 3

3.  What “lead actor” can be  
   Fact 2 says the lead’s room and the lead’s parent’s room are the same size.  
   A person whose parent is not in the cast therefore cannot be the lead, so the
   mother cannot be the lead.  Possible leads: Hans, sister, son, daughter.

4.  Equal-border requirement (Fact 1)  
   The lead and the lead’s sibling must have rooms that border the same number of
   other rooms.  The only equal-border pairs available are  
   (A,C) – both border 2  and  (D,E) – both border 3  
   (No pair of rooms borders 4, because only B borders 4 rooms.)

5.  Try Hans as lead  
   One must place Hans and his sister in (A,C) or (D,E) and then make Hans’s room
   the same size as his mother’s.  All possibilities violate Fact 3 or Fact 4
   (details checked systematically), so Hans cannot be the lead.

6.  Try the son as lead  
   Lead = son, sibling = daughter.  All placements contradict Fact 2 or Fact 3,
   so the son cannot be the lead.

7.  Try the daughter as lead  
   Lead = daughter, sibling = son.  Again every placement breaks Fact 3 or Fact 4,
   so the daughter cannot be the lead.

8.  Try the sister as lead (works)  
   Use the equal-border pair (A,C).

        Room A  – sister  (woman, borders 2, small)
        Room C  – Hans    (man,    borders 2, large)
        Room D  – mother  (woman,  borders 3, small)
        Room B  – son     (man,    borders 4, large)
        Room E  – daughter(woman,  borders 3, large)

   • Lead/sibling border count: A and C each border 2 rooms.  
   • Lead/parent room size: sister (A) and mother (D) are both in small rooms.  
   • Hans’s room (C) and his daughter’s room (E) do not touch.  
   • Each room borders at least one man’s room (A→B, B→C, C→B, D→B, E→B) and at
     least one woman’s room (obvious from placement).

   All four facts are satisfied, so this is a valid arrangement.

9.  Uniqueness  
   We already ruled out Hans, son, and daughter as possible leads; the mother
   cannot be the lead because her parent is not in the cast.  Hence the only
   possible and realizable lead is the sister.

Final answer: Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr.’s sister is the lead actor.",True
150,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step by step

Step 0 –  What matters to a lion  
A lion is prepared to eat the sheep only if, after doing so, he is 100 % certain he will not be eaten himself.  
• If he is not perfectly safe, he will forgo mutton and live on grass.  
• If he **is** perfectly safe, he prefers the (tastier) sheep.

Step 1 –  Reduce the problem to “Is the new sheep safe?”  
If a particular lion (call him L) is thinking of eating the sheep, he must predict what happens **after** he eats and has turned into a sheep.  
At that moment there will be one fewer lion on the island.  
Therefore “Will L eat?” ⇔ “If I subtract one lion from the current total, will the new sheep be safe?”

Step 2 –  Work out the safety of a sheep for small numbers of lions

0 lions (trivial warm-up) A sheep is obviously safe.

1 lion • If that single lion eats the sheep he becomes a sheep.  
   • There will then be 0 lions, so the new sheep is perfectly safe.  
   Therefore with 1 lion the sheep **does get** eaten.

2 lions • Suppose one of them tried to eat the sheep.  
    He would turn into a sheep while the other (now sole) lion remains.  
   • From the 1-lion case we know a lone lion *will* eat any sheep,  
    so the first lion would then be eaten.  
   • A lion prefers grass to being eaten, so no lion initiates the attack.  
   Therefore with 2 lions the sheep is **safe**.

3 lions • Imagine one lion contemplates eating the sheep.  
    Afterwards there would be 2 lions left.  
   • From the 2-lion result we know that a sheep **is** safe when 2 lions watch it.  
   • Thus the new sheep would be safe; the acting lion likes that outcome,  
    so he goes ahead and eats.  
   Therefore with 3 lions the sheep **does get** eaten.

We can already see a pattern:  
# lions → sheep’s fate  
0 safe, 1 eaten, 2 safe, 3 eaten …

Step 3 –  Inductive argument for all N lions

Inductive hypothesis  
Let Safe(N) mean “a sheep is safe when N lions are present”.  
We have established  
Safe(0) = T, Safe(1) = F, Safe(2) = T, Safe(3) = F.

Inductive step  
Assume we know Safe(k) for every k ≤ N.  
Consider N+1 lions.  
• A lion who is deciding whether to eat asks “If I do, there will afterwards be N lions – is a sheep safe in that world?”  
• If Safe(N) = T, he is totally safe and prefers to eat, so the sheep is eaten → Safe(N+1) = F.  
• If Safe(N) = F, eating would doom him, so he refuses → sheep survives → Safe(N+1) = T.

Hence Safe(N+1) = NOT Safe(N) for every N ≥ 0, so safety simply alternates with N.  
Consequently

Safe(N) is True iff N is even.

Step 4 –  Apply the result to 100 lions

100 is even.  
Therefore Safe(100) = True: a sheep watched by 100 lions will not be eaten.  
The “nearest” lion mentioned in the assumptions will think the situation through, realise that after eating he would face 99 lions (an odd number → sheep not safe → he would be eaten), and will therefore decline to attack. Because every lion is just as logical, none of them will attack.

Final answer: The sheep will NOT be eaten; with 100 (an even number of) lions it is safe.",True

153,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).",,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated.

Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let N be the number of villagers who were actually nominated.

What every villager knows  
• Everybody can see who among the others was nominated, but not whether he himself was.  
• Everyone knows that at least one person was nominated, and everyone knows that everyone knows this, etc. (common knowledge).  
• Each nominated person sees N − 1 nominations; each non-nominated person sees N nominations.

How a clever villager reasons (induction on the number of nominations)

1. N = 1  
   The single nominated villager sees no one nominated.  
   Because he knows there must be at least one nomination, he concludes it must be himself and appears the first night.

2. N = 2  
   Each nominated villager sees exactly one nomination (the other).  
   He first asks: “Could there be only one nomination?”  
   If that were true, the person he sees would have come forward on the first night (case N = 1).  
   When no one appears on the first night, both deduce N ≠ 1, hence they themselves must also be nominated.  
   Both therefore appear the second night.

3. Inductive step  
   Assume that if exactly k villagers are nominated, they all appear together on night k.  
   Now suppose N = k + 1.  
   Each nominated villager sees k nominations.  
   He wonders if k might be the total.  
   If that were so, those k would all appear on night k (by the induction hypothesis).  
   When nights 1 through k pass with no appearance, every nominated villager realizes the total cannot be k, so it must be k + 1, meaning he too is nominated.  
   Consequently all k + 1 nominated villagers appear on night k + 1.

By induction, if N villagers were nominated, all N will first step forward on night N.

What actually happened  
The first time anyone appeared was the 30th night. Therefore N = 30, and all 30 nominated villagers appeared together that night.

154,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?",,"The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.
As they were good for a meal, I suppose the kids weren't so rotten after all!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning  

1.  The story keeps calling the culprits “kids.”  
    •  In ordinary speech that means children, but “kid” is also the proper word for a young goat.  
    •  Near the end the puzzle warns: “Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals …”.  
       If the victims really were human children, eating them would be cannibalism, so this warning would be pointless.  
       The warning only makes sense if the “kids” to be eaten are goats, not people.  

2.  Details in the narrative fit goats better than human youngsters.  
    •  Goats wandering into an open grocery and nibbling produce is believable.  
    •  Goats can easily knock someone down or butt him into a ditch.  
    •  Chasing goats through town and getting other property owners (who also suffered goat damage) to help is plausible.  

3.  The poem that opens the dinner is full of food imagery:  
       “as we eat, our justice is served,”  
       “Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.”  
    It is not merely a celebration after an execution; the dinner itself IS the punishment.  

4.  Biblical-law allusion: “Not an ‘eye for an eye,’ but rather ‘one for two.’ ”  
    Exodus 22:4 says a thief of livestock must pay back double (“one for two”).  
    The goats stole produce, so the owner’s “justice” is to take the goats themselves.  

5.  Putting all the clues together:  
    •  The three troublesome young goats have been slaughtered.  
    •  They are now the main course of the “Repast of Right.”  
    •  The people at the table are eating roast kid (goat meat), which is why they are not cannibals even though they are “eating kids.”

Totaling 10 people in all (Alex, David, Jamie, Jessica, John, Justin, Lincoln, Martha, Mary and Tina).
1.  One of Jamie's ancestors was David.
2.  John's sister gave birth to Tina.
3.  Mary went bowling with her nephew last Saturday.
4.  Alex is cousins with one of the girls.
5.  Justin married Mary.
6.  Jessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.
7. Lincoln's brother showed Justin's son his baseball cards.",,"Martha and David were the grandparents.
They gave birth to John and Mary.
John married Jessica, who gave birth to Lincoln and Alex.
Mary married Justin and gave birth to Tina and Jamie.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"David and Martha are the grandparents.  
They have two children: Mary and John.  

Mary married Justin  
 Their two children are Jamie (son) and Tina (daughter).  

John married Jessica  
 Their two children are Alex (son) and Lincoln (son).

This arrangement satisfies all seven clues.

Final answer: David & Martha → Mary–Justin (children: Jamie, Tina) and John–Jessica (children: Alex, Lincoln)",True
158,"Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?",,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let “today’’ be the day we are looking for and denote it by T.  
Label the days of the week 0–6, with

0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, … , 6 = Saturday.  

1.  Translate the two curious sentences.

   •  “When the day after tomorrow is yesterday …’’  
      The day after tomorrow (relative to T) is T+2.  
      It will be “yesterday’’ on the day that follows it, namely on the day

              A = T + 3  (mod 7).

   •  “… that day was which was ‘today’ when the day before yesterday was tomorrow’’  
      The day before yesterday (relative to T) is T–2.  
      It is called “tomorrow’’ on the day that precedes it, namely on the day

              B = T – 3  (mod 7).

   So A = T+3 and B = T–3 (all arithmetic mod 7).

2.  Interpret “as far from Sunday as’’.

    The “distance’’ of a day D from Sunday is the fewest days you must move
    forward or backward to reach Sunday:

            dist(D) = min(D, 7–D),       0 ≤ D ≤ 6.

    For example, dist(Monday)=1, dist(Saturday)=1, dist(Wednesday)=3.

3.  Express Priscilla’s condition.

        dist(A)  =  dist(B)
        dist(T+3) = dist(T–3).

4.  Test the seven possibilities for T.

    T = 0 (Sun):   T+3 = 3,  dist = 3  
                   T–3 = 4,  dist = 3  ✓

    T = 1 (Mon):   T+3 = 4,  dist = 3  
                   T–3 = 5,  dist = 2  ✗

    T = 2 (Tue):   5 →2,   6 →1  ✗  
    T = 3 (Wed):   6 →1,   0 →0  ✗  
    T = 4 (Thu):   0 →0,   1 →1  ✗  
    T = 5 (Fri):   1 →1,   2 →2  ✗  
    T = 6 (Sat):   2 →2,   3 →3  ✗  

    Only T = 0 (Sunday) satisfies the equality.

5.  Verification in words.

    If today is Sunday:
    – Day after tomorrow is Tuesday; Tuesday is “yesterday’’ on Wednesday.  
      So A is Wednesday, three days from Sunday.  
    – Day before yesterday is Friday; Friday is “tomorrow’’ on Thursday.  
      So B is Thursday, also three days from Sunday.

    The distances match, exactly as Priscilla said.

Hence the children were talking on a Sunday.

Final answer: Sunday",True

4. Some large reptiles are steeplechasers.
5. Only steeplechasers can watch hockey games.
6.Those alligators that carry umbrellas in the shower know that flying fish live in the trees.
7. Those that prefer chocolate to caramel candy cannot be steeplechasers.
8. Steeplechasers are vegetarians.",,Only alligators that are vegetarians are allowed to watch rabbits play hockey.,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning step-by-step

1. Statement 3: “Certain days are set aside for alligators to watch rabbits play hockey.”  
   This guarantees the existence of at least one alligator that does, in fact, watch a hockey game.  
   (∃x)(Alligator(x) ∧ Watches‐Hockey(x))

2. Statement 5: “Only steeplechasers can watch hockey games.”  
   Translating “only” gives the implication  
   Watches‐Hockey(x) ⇒ Steeplechaser(x).

   Applying this to the alligator from step 1, we learn that that alligator is a steeplechaser.  
   (∃x)(Alligator(x) ∧ Steeplechaser(x))

3. Statement 8: “Steeplechasers are vegetarians.”  
   So Steeplechaser(x) ⇒ Vegetarian(x).

   Therefore the same alligator is also a vegetarian:  
   (∃x)(Alligator(x) ∧ Vegetarian(x))

Conclusion  
We have proved that at least one alligator is a vegetarian.

Final answer: Some alligators are vegetarians.",True
160,"Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?",,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.
(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.  Obviously, I've changed the names).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Biggie’s will really contains two separate instructions –  
one for “the child that is a boy’’ and one for “the child that is a girl.’’  
To make both instructions operative the judge treated each child’s existence
independently, dividing the estate into two equal notional halves and applying
the proper clause to each half.

1. Give one‐half of the estate to the “boy case.’’  
   • From that half the boy must receive ⅔ and the widow ⅓.  
   • So Manny gets (½)·(⅔)=⅓ of the whole estate,  
     Faerie gets (½)·(⅓)=⅙ of the whole estate.

2. Give the other half to the “girl case.’’  
   • From that half the girl must receive ⅓ and the widow ⅔.  
   • So Goodie gets (½)·(⅓)=⅙ of the whole estate,  
     Faerie gets (½)·(⅔)=⅓ of the whole estate.

Adding the widow’s two portions and each child’s portion:

   Manny : ⅓  
   Goodie : ⅙  
   Faerie : ⅙ + ⅓ = ½

The shares sum to 1 (⅓+⅙+½ = 1), and each half of the estate has been
distributed exactly as Biggie directed for a child of that sex.

Final answer: Widow Faerie receives ½ of the estate, son Manny ⅓, and daughter Goodie ⅙.",True

163,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.
(P.S. Sorry if this offended anybody, not that I think it would, but in my other teaser people were complaining so I'm just putting this in here for warning).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"We need four two-digit sets, with the clues:

1) Sum of digits in 3rd set ∈ {11,12,13}.  
2) 4th set = 3rd set + 13.  
3) 1st set = 2·(2nd set) + 7.  
4) digit-sum(4th) > digit-sum(1st).  
5) No 0, 3, 6; every other digit 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 appears at least once.  
6) 1st set is a two-digit perfect square.

Step-by-step:

Perfect two-digit squares with allowed digits: 25, 49, 81.  
– 25 gives 2nd set (25−7)/2 = 9 (one digit) → reject.  
– 81 gives 2nd set 37 (contains 3) → reject.  
– 49 gives 2nd set (49−7)/2 = 21, allowed.  
So 1st = 49, 2nd = 21.

3rd set candidates (allowed digits, digit-sum 11–13):

29, 47, 74, 92, 48, 57, 75, 84, 49, 58, 85, 94.

Add 13 to get 4th set and test:

47→60 (digit 0,6) reject  
74→87 (sum 15>13) keep

49→62 (6) reject  
58→71 (sum 8≤13) reject  
85→98 (sum 17>13) keep

Now check digit coverage 1,2,4,5,7,8,9:

(a) 74–87 gives digits 1,2,4,4,7,7,8,9 -> missing 5 → reject.  
(b) 75–88 gives digits 1,2,4,5,7,8,8,9 → all seven digits present → keep.  
(c) 84–97 missing 5 → reject.  
(d) 85–98 missing 7 → reject.

Only viable pair: 3rd = 75, 4th = 88.

Verify all clues:

Sum(3rd) = 7+5 = 12 (OK).  
4th = 75 + 13 = 88 (OK).  
2·21 + 7 = 49 (OK).  
Digit-sum(4th) = 16 > digit-sum(1st)=13 (OK).  
Digits used: 1,2,4,5,7,8,9; no 0,3,6 (OK).  
1st set 49 is 7² (OK).

Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that

Doing this yields:

Allocation   P  C  M = Anu  Bob  Coy  
Truth tables  
Anu :  T  T  T  
Bob :  T  F  T  
Coy :  F  F  F  

This single allocation fulfils the required pattern:  
Anu is the truth-teller, Coy the liar, Bob the alternator.

All other five allocations fail to give the required pattern, hence the above
assignment is the only possible situation.

Consequences (true in every valid scenario):  
• Anu always tells the truth.  
• Coy always lies.  
• The Chemistry book belongs to Bob.

Therefore all three given statements can be concluded.

166,"Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".","Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.  Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

6. V∉S ⇒ (A∉S ∧ Ch∉S)        (contrapositive: A∈S ∨ Ch∈S ⇒ V∈S)

Step 1:  Show that A cannot be in S.  
From (6) contrapositive, A∈S ⇒ V∈S.  
But from (2) contrapositive, A∈S ⇒ V∉S.  
Contradiction, hence A∉S.

Step 2:  Use A∉S to simplify other rules.

  Equivalently, V∉S ⇒ L∈S.

  Equivalently, Ch∉S ⇒ W∈S.  

Step 3:  Two possible cases.

 3. Antecedent true ⇒ Ch∈S (true) – OK  
 4. Antecedent true ⇒ V∈S (true) – OK  
 5. W∉S so antecedent false – OK  
 6. V∈S so antecedent false – OK  

 All statements satisfied.  Thus {Ch, V} works.

CASE II Ch ∉ S  
 Then by Ch∉S ⇒ W∈S, we must have W∈S.  
 Rule 5 says W must be paired with C or Ch, so partner must be C.  
 Thus S = {W, C}.  
 Check statement 4: L∉S and A∉S, so antecedent true ⇒ V∈S.  
 But V∉S in this set, contradiction.  
 Hence this case is impossible.

Therefore the only possible set is S = {Ch, V}; i.e. Sir Charles and Sir Vincent rode out to slay the dragon.

The next day he said: ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.""
On which day of the week does Steve tell the truth?",,"Mad Ade's cousin  Steve tells the truth on Tuesdays
The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth. But, they have no such day in common. Therefore one of them must be true, and the other must refer to that day. Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let

D₁ = day on which the first statement was made  
D₂ = D₁ + 1 (the next day)  
D₃ = D₁ + 2 (the third day)  

Steve tells the truth on exactly one fixed day of each week; call this day T.  
On every other day he lies, so at most one of the three statements can be true.

Statements

S₁ (on D₁): “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.”  
S₂ (on D₂): “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.”  
S₃ (on D₃): “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Assume S₁ is the true statement (D₁ = T).

If S₁ is true, Steve really does lie on Monday and Tuesday, so T ≠ Monday, Tuesday.

S₂ and S₃ are then false.

• S₂ false ⇒ D₂ ∉ {Sunday, Saturday, Thursday}.  
  Thus D₂ ∈ {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday}.

• S₃ false ⇒ “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays” is false, so at least one of
  {Wednesday, Friday} must be the truth day.  
  But T = D₁, already not Monday or Tuesday, forces T ∈ {Wednesday, Friday}.

  – If T = Wednesday then D₁ = Wednesday, D₂ = Thursday;  
    but S₂ would then be true (Thursday ∈ {Sun, Sat, Thu}), contradiction.  
  – If T = Friday then D₁ = Friday, D₂ = Saturday;  
    S₂ would be true again (Saturday ∈ {Sun, Sat, Thu}), contradiction.

Hence S₁ cannot be the true statement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Assume S₂ is the true statement (D₂ = T).

Then D₂ ∈ {Sunday, Saturday, Thursday}.  
S₁ is false, so at least one of Monday or Tuesday must be the truth day
(else “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays” would be true).  
But the truth day is D₂, which is not Monday or Tuesday—contradiction.

So S₂ cannot be the true statement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Therefore S₃ is the true statement (D₃ = T).

S₃ true ⇒ Steve really lies on Friday and Wednesday, so T ≠ Friday, Wednesday.

S₂ false ⇒ D₂ ∉ {Sunday, Saturday, Thursday} ⇒ D₂ ∈ {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday}.

S₁ false ⇒ At least one of Monday or Tuesday is the truth day, so  
T ∈ {Monday, Tuesday}.

Combine with T ≠ Friday, Wednesday → T is Monday or Tuesday.

Since D₃ = T, examine the two possibilities:

• If T = Monday then D₂ = Sunday.  
  S₂ (said on Sunday) would be “Today is either Sun, Sat, or Thu”, which is true—contradiction (it must be false).

• If T = Tuesday then D₂ = Monday, D₁ = Sunday.  
  – S₂ on Monday: “Today is Sun/Sat/Thu” is false (good).  
  – S₁ on Sunday: “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays” is false because he lies on Monday but tells the truth on Tuesday (good).

This arrangement is consistent, so the unique solution is

Truth day T = Tuesday.

How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?",,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Weights on the counter (in lb): 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 31

Let their weights be a and b.  
Laura buys K-pieces whose total weight is twice Norma’s: 2(a+b).  
Altogether the two ladies remove 3(a+b) pounds of Kebabrie from the counter.

Because there are only 5 Kebabrie pieces, after Norma’s two pieces there are at most three other Kebabrie pieces left for Laura, so 2(a+b) must be obtainable with at most three of the remaining four weights.

We test each candidate for the Chillirella piece.

1.  C = 15 → K = {16,18,19,20,31}.  
   Double of every possible Norma–pair among these five weights (34,35,36, …, 102) is never equal to the sum of at most three of the other weights.  Impossible.

2.  C = 16 → K = {15,18,19,20,31}.

6.  C = 31 → K = {15,16,18,19,20}.

Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

1. Let N be the total number of truthtellers in the room (0 ≤ N ≤ 12).

2. Man i (i = 1 … 12) says:  
   “At most i – 1 of us are truthtellers.”  
   Symbolically, his statement Sᵢ is “N ≤ i – 1.”

3. If Sᵢ is true, then man i is a truthteller, so N ≤ i – 1.  
   If Sᵢ is false, then man i is a liar, so N ≥ i (the negation of “N ≤ i – 1”).

4. Therefore:
   • For every i with i ≤ N, we have N ≥ i, so Sᵢ is false ⇒ man i is a liar.  
   • For every i with i > N, we have N ≤ i – 1, so Sᵢ is true ⇒ man i is a truthteller.

   Thus the first N men are liars and the remaining 12 – N men are truthtellers.

5. But by definition N itself must equal the number of truthtellers.  
   The scheme above gives 12 – N truthtellers, so
        N = 12 – N  ⇒  2N = 12  ⇒  N = 6.

6. Hence there are exactly 6 truthtellers and 6 liars, with the liars being the first six men (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and the truthtellers being the last six men (i = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).

After he answers, proceed as follows.  
• If he answers “YES”, turn over the left-hand card.

Why this always works

1. Centre card is the jack (probability 1⁄3)  
   – Both the left and right cards are aces.  
   – His answer is random, but whichever way you go (left on YES, right on NO) you take an ace.

   – If the left card is an ace he answers YES and you take that ace.  
   – If the left card is not an ace (there is only one jack, so the right card is the jack) he answers NO and you take the right card, which is the other ace.

In every possible arrangement of the three cards the rule “YES → left, NO → right” lands on an ace, so a single question is enough to locate one with certainty.

Door A must be followed by door B or E; B by C or E; C by D or F; D by A or F; E by B or D; and F by C or D."" With that the guards left through door B. In what order must the prisoner pass through the doors?",The prisoner must alternate exits and entrances. List the six possible orders then study the conditions to eliminate possibilities.,"The order is CFDABE. The guards entered through doors A and F and exited at door B. The prisoner must alternate exits and entrances. Let the unknown entrance be X. With a ""_"" denoting an exit door the possible orders are:

A → B, E  
B → C, E

E → B, D  
F → C, D  

The prisoner has to go through every door exactly once, so we are looking for a Hamiltonian path of length 6 in this digraph.

In addition we know that exactly three doors are “entrances only” and three are “exits only”.  
The guards’ behaviour fixes some of these: they came in through A and F (so A and F are entrances) and went out through B (so B is an exit).  Hence

entrances = {A, F, ?}  exits = {B, ?, ?}

Because the prisoner starts in the guard-room, the first door he uses must be an exit; each time he leaves the guard-room he must return through an entrance before he can leave again, so the six doors must alternate

exit, entrance, exit, entrance, exit, entrance.

Searching the graph for a Hamiltonian path that satisfies this alternation (and the fixed classifications of A, B, F) gives exactly one possibility:

182,"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?",,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile.

Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1.  Realise you may cut the tablets  
   – the active ingredient is uniformly distributed, so half a pill is half a dose.  
   – The pills are perfect little squares, so it is easy to cut them cleanly.  

2.  Put the three unknown tablets on the table.  
   You know that they consist of   
        1 Sildenafil (S) tablet and   
        2 Citrate (C) tablets.  

3.  Slice every one of those three tablets exactly in half.  
   You now have six half-tablets:  
        S₁ , S₂ (the two halves of the Sildenafil)  
        C₁ , C₂ (the two halves of the first Citrate)  
        C₃ , C₄ (the two halves of the second Citrate)  
   Of course you still do not know which half is which; you only know the total numbers.

4.  Make two little piles, “Dose A” and “Dose B”.  
   Put one half-tablet from each of the three original pills into each pile:  

        Dose A : S₁ + C₁ + C₃  
        Dose B : S₂ + C₂ + C₄  

   What is inside each dose?  
        • Each dose certainly contains one Sildenafil half (S) and two Citrate halves (C).  
        • So each dose at this point is ½ S + 1 C.  

5.  You therefore still need another ½ S in each dose.  
   Take ONE fresh Sildenafil tablet from the bottle (this is tomorrow’s tablet), cut it in half, and add  
        – one of those halves to Dose A,  
        – the other half to Dose B.

6.  Contents now:  
        Dose A : (½ S + ½ S) + (½ C + ½ C)  = 1 S + 1 C  
        Dose B : (½ S + ½ S) + (½ C + ½ C)  = 1 S + 1 C  

   Each pile is exactly one full Sildenafil dose and one full Citrate dose.

7.  Swallow Dose A today.  
   Keep Dose B in a labelled container and swallow it tomorrow.

Result  
• You have taken (over two days) exactly two Sildenafil tablets and two Citrate tablets, which is precisely what your prescription calls for.  
• No tablet is thrown away or wasted, and you never risk taking the wrong amount on any day.

Final answer: Cut the three indistinguishable tablets in half, split the halves into two equal piles, add half of a newly opened Sildenafil tablet to each pile, then take one pile today and the other tomorrow; each pile contains exactly one full Sildenafil dose and one full Citrate dose, so no medication is wasted.",True

Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false.

If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning in detail  

Let the apartments be numbered 1 (west) to 4 (east).  
Write A, B, C, D for the positions of Al, Ben, Carl, Dan, and let L be the landlord.

The four given implications are

S1 :  If Carl is not next to Ben  ⇒  L = Al and A = 1  
S2 :  If Al is east of Carl (A > C)  ⇒  L = Dan and D = 4  
S3 :  If Ben is not next to Dan  ⇒  L = Carl and C = 3  
S4 :  If Dan is east of Al (D > A)  ⇒  L = Ben and B = 2

Because the consequents of S1–S4 assign different landlords, no two of their antecedents may be true simultaneously (they would demand two different landlords).

Try each person as possible landlord.

1.  L = Al  
 To keep S2, S3, S4 from forcing a different landlord, their antecedents must all be false.  
 That yields the three conditions  
  A < C, Ben adjacent Dan, Dan west of Al.  
 Under these, Ben must be adjacent to Dan and Dan must be west of Al, which is impossible if Al is in apartment 1 (forced when S1’s antecedent is true). A consistent placement cannot be found, so Al cannot be the landlord.

2.  L = Dan  
 S4’s antecedent must be false, so Dan must be west of Al (D < A).  
 S1 and S3’s antecedents must be false as well, giving  
  Carl adjacent Ben, Ben adjacent Dan.  
 Ben would then have to be adjacent to both Carl and Dan, hence be in apartment 2 or 3 with Carl on one side and Dan on the other. A short enumeration shows this inevitably makes S2 true, forcing D = 4, which contradicts the already-required D < A.  Impossible; Dan cannot be the landlord.

3.  L = Carl  
 To avoid S1 forcing L = Al, Carl must be adjacent to Ben.  
 To avoid S2 forcing L = Dan, Al must be west of Carl (A < C).  
 To avoid S4 forcing L = Ben, Dan must be west of Al (D < A).

 Thus D < A < C and Ben is adjacent to Carl.  
 Choose the only ordering that fits all three inequalities inside four apartments:

  D = 1, A = 2, C = 3, B = 4.

 Check the implications:

 • C and B are adjacent, so S1’s antecedent is false – OK.  
 • A < C, so S2’s antecedent is false – OK.  
 • B (4) is not next to D (1), so S3’s antecedent is true; its consequent demands L = Carl and C = 3 – both satisfied.  
 • D < A, so S4’s antecedent is false – OK.

All statements are satisfied with Carl in apartment 3, Al in 2, Dan in 1, Ben in 4.

Therefore Carl can be (and must be) the landlord.

186,"Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?",,"To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"1.  Rate at which the two clock faces separate  
   • One clock gains 10 s per hour, the other loses 10 s per hour.  
   • Relative slip = 10 s + 10 s = 20 s per real hour.

2.  When will the dials coincide again?  
   • On a 12-hour dial two indications look identical whenever the faster clock is ahead of the slower by an exact 12 hours (or any multiple thereof).  
   • 12 h = 12 × 3600 s = 43 200 s.  
   • Time required for a 43 200 s separation at 20 s / h:  
     t = 43 200 s ÷ 20 (s / h) = 2 160 h = 90 days.  
   • The first (i.e. “next”) coincidence is therefore exactly 90 days after the clocks are set.

3.  Which calendar date is 90 days after a day in January?  
   • January has 31 days.  Counting forward 90 days from 31 January in a non-leap year:  
     31 Jan → 28 Feb (28 d) → 31 Mar (59 d) → 30 Apr (89 d) → 1 May (90 d).  
   • Any January date earlier than the 31st would reach April or earlier; any leap-year February (29 days) would put the 90th day on 30 April.  
   • Hence the only way the 90th day can fall in May is:  
       – the clocks were set on 31 January,  
       – the year is NOT a leap year,  
       – the coincidence occurs on 1 May.

4.  The “next time” both dials agree is therefore 1 May of that same non-leap year.

5.  The problem states that that day is Smoe’s 47th birthday.  
   • So Smoe was born on 1 May of year (current year − 47).  
   • The current (non-leap) year is therefore 1979 (because 1980 is a leap year).  
   • Thus Smoe’s birth year = 1979 − 47 = 1932.

6.  The other friend was born “a year later,” i.e. in 1933.

Conclusion: Smoe was born in May 1932, Joe in May 1933. Therefore Smoe is the older of the two friends.

Final answer: Smoe",True

189,"You are back on the same game show with four other contestants. You didn't realise last time that the winner gets another appearance on the show! You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

Congratulations!!! You won, again!! You are over the moon! You have become the first millionaire in five generations of your family history!!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning  
1. Let the four two–digit sets be A-B-C-D.  
2. Clue 4 says 4 × B equals D reversed, so B must be at most 24 (to keep 4 × B two–digit and ≤ 90).  
3. 4 × B has to contain the single 8 of the whole code (Clue 8), so we list 10 ≤ B ≤ 24 whose quadruple contains one 8:  
 12→48 17→68 21→84  
   • 20 gives 80 (contains 0 – forbidden), 22 gives 88 (two 8’s – forbidden).  
4. Clue 2 forbids the digits 5 and 7 everywhere, so B ≠ 17.  
   Hence the only possibilities are (B,D) = (12,84) or (21,48).  
5. With (B,D) = (12,84) we would need C’s first digit + 2 < 8 (Clue 1).  
   If C were 66 (Clue 7) its first digit is 6, giving 6 + 2 = 8 – too large.  
   So C would not be 66, forcing A = 66, but then the product of A’s digits is 36, violating Clue 6.  
   Therefore this branch is impossible.  
6. The viable branch is (B,D) = (21,48).  Now b₂ = 1, so Clue 1 gives c₁ + 1 < 8 ⇒ c₁ < 7.  
   Taking C = 66 (required somewhere by Clue 7) works because 6 + 1 = 7 < 8.  
7. Hence C = 66.  Digits used so far: {1,2,4,6,6,8}.  The unused allowed digits are 3 and 9.  
8. These two digits must form A.  Clue 6 demands the product of A’s digits be between 20 and 30: 3 × 9 = 27 satisfies this.  
   Of the two orders 39 and 93, Clue 5 rules out 93 (>90), so A = 39.  
9. Check all clues:  
   • Clue 1: 6 + 1 = 7 (<8) ✔  
   • Clue 2: only digits missing are 5,7 ✔  
   • Clue 3: 3 + 9 = 12 ≠ 10 ✔  
   • Clue 4: 4 × 21 = 84, reversed → 48 ✔  
   • Clue 5: 39,21,66,48 all ≤ 90 ✔  
   • Clue 6: 3 × 9 = 27 (between 20 and 30) ✔  
   • Clue 7: C = 66 ✔  
   • Clue 8: single 8 in last set ✔  

All conditions are met.

190,"A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Strategy chosen during the discussion  

1. Everybody will look only at the OTHER prisoners’ hats and count how many WHITE hats they see.  
2. If that number is EVEN, they will say “WHITE”.  
   If that number is ODD, they will say “BLACK”.  

Why the strategy works  

Let T be the total number of white hats actually put on by the warden.

• Case A – T is odd.  
  – A prisoner whose own hat is white sees T-1 white hats, an even number, so he says “WHITE”: correct.  
  – A prisoner whose own hat is black sees T white hats, an odd number, so he says “BLACK”: correct.  
  Thus every single prisoner is right.

• Case B – T is even.  
  – A prisoner whose own hat is white sees T-1 white hats, an odd number, so he says “BLACK”: wrong.  
  – A prisoner whose own hat is black sees T white hats, an even number, so he says “WHITE”: wrong.  
  Thus every single prisoner is wrong.

In every possible hat assignment the prisoners’ answers are therefore EITHER all correct (Case A) OR all wrong (Case B).  
Since the warden frees them in either situation, the prisoners are guaranteed to escape no matter how the warden places the hats.

Final answer: Each prisoner counts the white hats he can see; if the count is even he guesses “white,” otherwise he guesses “black.” This guarantees that the entire group is simultaneously all right or all wrong, so they always go free.",True

Let the cars be  
S = Silver Dream, G = Golden Pleasure, D = Devine Lightning, R = Rusting Bucket.  
Let the sons be Derek (De), Berrick (Be), Merick (Me), Eric (Er).

Each rule is of the form “X will not get Y unless …”, i.e.  
If X gets Y then the stated conditions MUST hold.

1. De = G  ⇒  Be = S and Er = R  
2. Be = R  ⇒  Me = D and De = S  
3. Er = D  ⇒  De = G and Be = S  
4. De = S  ⇒  Me = D and Er = R  
5. Be = S  ⇒  De = D and Er = R  
6. De = D  ⇒  Be = G and Me = S  
7. Me = D  ⇒  Be = G and De = R  
8. De = R  ⇒  Be = D and Er = G  
9. Me = S  ⇒  Er = G  

Because every son must receive one different car, test each possible car for Derek.

A. Suppose De = G.  
Rule 1 forces Be = S, Er = R, leaving Me = D.  
Rule 5 then demands De = D, contradicting De = G. Impossible.

B. Suppose De = S.  
Rule 4 forces Me = D and Er = R, leaving Be = G.  
Rule 7 (Me = D) then demands De = R, contradicting De = S. Impossible.

C. Suppose De = D.  
Rule 6 forces Be = G and Me = S, leaving Er = R.  
Rule 9 (Me = S) then demands Er = G, contradicting Er = R. Impossible.

D. Suppose De = R.  
Rule 8 forces Be = D and Er = G, leaving Me = S.  
Rule 9 (Me = S) requires Er = G, which is already satisfied.  
No other rule is violated:

• 1: antecedent false (De ≠ G) – ok.  
• 2: antecedent false (Be ≠ R) – ok.  
• 3: antecedent false (Er ≠ D) – ok.  
• 4: antecedent false (De ≠ S) – ok.

• 6: antecedent false (De ≠ D) – ok.  
• 7: antecedent false (Me ≠ D) – ok.  
• 8: checked – ok.  
• 9: checked – ok.

Thus the only assignment consistent with all nine conditions is:

Eric → Golden Pleasure

193,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Number the pumpkins 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 around the circle (clock-wise).  
When you “blow” pumpkin k, the three pumpkins k−1 , k , k+1 (indices taken mod 7) change
state (lit ⇄ out).

Let xk∈{0,1} denote whether you will blow pumpkin k (1=yes, 0=no).
Let bj∈{0,1} be the final state of pumpkin j (1=lit, 0=out).  
Initially every pumpkin is lit, i.e. the initial vector is (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).

Each blow adds (mod 2) the vector that has 1’s in positions k−1 , k , k+1.
Hence for every j we have

   bj = 1 + xj−1 + xj + xj+1 (mod 2).                (∗)

We want all pumpkins out, so set bj=0.  Then

   xj−1 + xj + xj+1 = 1  for j = 0,…,6.            (1)

Solve (1).  From the first equation

   x6 = 1 + x0 + x1.

Insert this into the seventh equation (j=6):

   x0 + x5 + x6 = 1  ⇒  x5 = 1 + x0 + x6 = x1.

Continuing in this manner gives

   x4 = x0 ,   x3 = 1 + x0 + x1 ,   x2 = x1 ,

and finally the second equation forces x0 = 1, hence x1 = 1 as well.  Therefore

   x0 = x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = x5 = x6 = 1.

Thus every variable must be 1; i.e. you must blow on every single pumpkin
(and, because the linear system has full rank, this is the only possible
solution).  Because each blow flips an odd number (3) of lanterns, an odd
number (seven) of blows is also necessary to change the overall parity from
7 lit to 0 lit.

Practical recipe:
start anywhere, walk once around the circle, and blow on every pumpkin
exactly one time (order does not matter).  After the seventh blow all seven
jack-o’-lanterns will be out and the Great Pumpkin will leave you in peace.

Final answer: Blow on each of the seven lanterns exactly once; after the seventh blow all of them are extinguished.",True

1.  Denote the five colours  
   R = red, B = blue, Y = yellow, G = green, K = black.  
   Each day Peter wears an unordered pair of different colours.

2.  Rule 3 says one colour is used on exactly four days.  
   Because the same colour may not appear on consecutive days, the only
   way to fit four occurrences into the seven-day week is on
   Monday-Wednesday-Friday-Sunday (positions 1, 3, 5, 7).

3.  Monday’s pair is {B,K} (rule 4).
   Therefore the “four-day” colour must be either B or K.

   •  If it were K, we would need three more distinct pairs containing K,
      but K cannot be paired with R (rule 7) and {B,K} is already used,
      leaving only {K,Y} and {K,G}.  That gives at most two further pairs,
      so K cannot be the four-day colour.

   •  Hence B is the colour used on four days: Monday, Wednesday,
     Friday, Sunday.

4.  Consecutive-day restriction forces the following:

       Mon   Tue   Wed   Thu   Fri   Sat   Sun
       B,K   —     B,?   G,?   B,?   —     B,?

   Tuesday cannot contain B or K,  
   Wednesday cannot contain the two Tuesday colours or K (to avoid
   repeating {B,K}),  
   Thursday must contain G (rule 5) and no Wednesday colour,  
   Friday contains B (no Y, rule 6) and no Thursday colour,  
   Saturday contains no Friday colour,  
   Sunday contains B and no Saturday colour, and must give a
   new B-pair (rule 1).

5.  Start with Tuesday.  The only possible pair not using B or K is
   {R,G}, {R,Y} or {Y,G}.  

   •  If Tuesday were {R,Y}, then Wednesday would have to be {B,G},
     but G could not then appear on Thursday → impossible.

   •  If Tuesday were {Y,G}, then Wednesday would have to be {B,R},
     which would repeat on Friday (see below) → impossible.

   •  Therefore Tuesday must be {R,G}.

   That fixes the rest of the week uniquely:

       Mon  {B,K}
       Tue  {R,G}
       Wed  {B,Y}          (Y is the only colour not in Tue and not K)
       Thu  {G,K}          (needs G, not B or Y, cannot duplicate Tue)
       Fri  {B,R}          (needs B, not G or K, no Y allowed)
       Sat  {Y,K}          (cannot use B or R, cannot duplicate Thu)
       Sun  {B,G}          (new B-pair, no Y or K from Sat)

6.  Verification
   •  All seven pairs are distinct.  
   •  No colour appears on consecutive days.  
   •  B appears four times (Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun); every other colour ≤3.  
   •  All special rules (4–7) are satisfied.

Hence the Saturday pair is {Y,K}: yellow and black.

Final answer: Yellow and black",True
195,"At the Christmas party of the ""Sweaty Chef"" kebab shop, the owner Mr Juan, took note of how many people were present. Although he was a bit tipsy when he made his note, and thus made a mistake.  His notes were as follows:-
1, There were 9 men and children.
2, There were 2 more women than children.
3, The number of different man-woman couples possible was 24. Note that if there were 7 men and 5 women, then there would have been 35 man-woman couples possible.
Also, of the three groups - men, women and children - at the party:
4, There were 4 of one group.
5, There were 6 of one group.
6, There were 8 of one group.
Exactly one of the above 6 statements is false.
Can you tell which one is false? Also, how many men, women and children are there at the party?",,"Statement (4) is false. There are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children.
Assume that Statements (4), (5) and (6) are all true. Then, Statement (1) is false. But then Statement (2) and (3) both can not be true. Thus, contradictory to the fact that exactly one statement is false.
So Statement (4) or Statement (5) or Statement (6) is false. Also, Statements (1), (2) and (3) all are true.
From (1) and (2), there are 11 men and women. Then from (3), there are 2 possible cases - either there are 8 men and 3 women or there are 3 men and 8 women.
If there are 8 men and 3 women, then there is 1 child. Then Statements (4) and (5) both are false, which is not possible.
Hence, there are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children. Statement (4) is false.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  
M = number of men, W = number of women, C = number of children.

Write the six statements algebraically:

1. M + C = 9  
2. W = C + 2  
3. M × W = 24  
4. “One group has 4 people.”  
5. “One group has 6 people.”  
6. “One group has 8 people.”

Exactly one of these is wrong.  We test each possibility.

Assume statement 4 is the only false one (so no group has 4 people); the other five are true.

From (1) and (2) we have  
 M = 9 − C and W = C + 2.

Substitute these into (3):

(9 − C)(C + 2) = 24  
−C² + 7C + 18 = 24  
C² − 7C + 6 = 0  
(C − 6)(C − 1) = 0  ⇒  C = 6 or C = 1.

• If C = 6: W = 8, M = 3.  
  Group sizes are 3, 6, 8.  
  Statements 1,2,3,5,6 are satisfied; statement 4 is indeed false.  
  Exactly one statement is wrong – perfect.

• If C = 1: W = 3, M = 8.  
  Group sizes are 1, 3, 8 – statement 5 (“one group has 6”) would also be false, giving two errors.  Reject.

Thus the only consistent assignment is

Men  = 3  
Women = 8  
Children = 6

and the sole false statement is statement 4 (“There were 4 of one group.”).

Final answer: The mistaken statement is number 4, and the party had 3 men, 8 women, and 6 children.",True

The two letters to initially find are F & S. The letter above the one which is between them is G.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. Construct the 5 × 5 square (omitting Q) in ordinary reading order:

F  G  H  I  J  
K  L  M  N  O  
P  R  S  T  U

   B is at (row 1, col 2); just below it is G (row 2, col 2).

3. “Letter just before the letter just below B”  
   The square is filled left-to-right, so the letter immediately before G in that row is F (row 2, col 1).

4. “Letter just above Y”  
   Y is at (row 5, col 4); just above it is T (row 4, col 4).

5. “Letter just before the letter just above Y”  
   The letter immediately before T in that row is S (row 4, col 3).

The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.

The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.

His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Clues that nothing here can be real  

1. Phil is “watching” the rain fall on the whole town while sitting in his bedroom.  
   The only way one can see an entire town from a bedroom is if the town is tiny – a model.  

2. Six-foot-deep water has driven the inhabitants upstairs, yet Phil and Norma suffer no
   inconvenience at all.  The townspeople are therefore not real people but figures.  

3. A “yearly Kebab harvest” makes no sense agriculturally; it sounds like the whimsical
   produce of a make-believe place.  

4. The town’s name, MADADIA, and the comic names Phil Fegit and Norma Fegit (“Phil/normal
   forget”) also hint at a made-up story.

Reasoning these points together we conclude that Phil is looking at a model layout (perhaps
a model‐railroad town or a computer simulation) that he himself built and has just doused
with water to simulate rain.  To him the disaster is “important,” but to Norma it is
obviously nothing but her husband’s toy.  That is why, quite sensibly, “she could really
care less.”

Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

Let the three ministerial statements be  
(1) “It’s about subsidies.”  
(2) “Nothing is going down.”  
(3) “Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.”

Facts given  
• Exactly one of any three consecutive statements M makes is true.  
• The announcement concerns exactly one measure: an increase or a decrease of wages, subsidies or taxes (one and only one of the six possibilities).

Analyse which of (1)–(3) is the sole true statement.

A. Suppose (1) is the true one (the change concerns subsidies).  
Then (2) and (3) are false.  
(2) false ⇒ something is going down, and since only subsidies are in play, subsidies must be going down.  
But if subsidies are going down, (3) (“subsidies are going down or wages will rise”) becomes true, contradicting the assumption that only one statement is true.  
So (1) cannot be the single true statement.

B. Suppose (3) is the true one.  
Then (1) and (2) are false.  
(1) false ⇒ the change is not about subsidies.  
Therefore the only way for (3) to be true is that wages rise.  
But (2) is false, so something must be going down; with only one measure allowed to change and wages already going up, nothing is going down—contradiction.  
So (3) cannot be the single true statement.

C. Therefore the single true statement must be (2): “Nothing is going down.”

Consequences of (2) being the lone truth  
• Nothing decreases; the change is an increase.  
• Since (1) is false, the change is not about subsidies.  
• Since (3) is false, there is no wage increase.

The only remaining single change consistent with these three facts is an increase in taxes.

203,There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?,"By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of the pile size modulo 101.

1. Because a legal move is any number from 1 to 100, in every complete “round” of two moves the two players together can remove at most 100+100 = 200 eggs, but what really matters is that the set of legal moves is exactly the numbers 1,…,100.  
   For such a game the classic winning tactic is to leave the opponent a multiple of (maximum + 1) – here that number is 100 + 1 = 101.

2. Start with 2008 eggs.  
   Compute 2008 mod 101:

   101 × 19 = 1919  
   2008 − 1919 = 89.

   Thus 2008 = 19·101 + 89.

3. If you remove 89 eggs, 2008 − 89 = 1919 = 19·101, so you hand your opponent a pile that is exactly a multiple of 101.

4. Response strategy: whatever number y (1 ≤ y ≤ 100) your opponent now takes, you remove 101 − y eggs (which is again between 1 and 100).  
   The two moves together always remove 101 eggs, so after every pair of moves the pile is again a multiple of 101.

5. Eventually the opponent faces exactly 101 eggs.  
   They cannot take all 101 (limit is 100), so they leave you between 1 and 100 eggs.  
   You then take the remaining eggs and win.

6. Any first move other than 89 fails against perfect play: if you do not leave a multiple of 101, the opponent can adopt the very strategy above and beat you.

Therefore, to guarantee victory you must take

89 eggs on your very first move.

By the end of the game, two players were charged with the same number of errors, either 1 or 2. This number (?) is to be deduced from the clues.
Second Inning
No player ended up with the same number of errors and RBIs.
Third Inning
The left fielder had his 1 RBI when, with runners at 1st and 3rd, he hit one over the head of the Peaches' 2nd baseman and into right field.
Fourth Inning
Jimmy Blake earned his 2 RBIs when he hit a triple, allowing the center fielder and the 3rd baseman to score.
Fifth Inning
Flynn had his 1 error when he missed a throw to 1st base.
Sixth Inning
Tim, who posted either 2 or 3 RBIs, ended up with 1 error more than the pitcher after he (Tim) quite literally dropped the ball.
Seventh Inning
The player who finished with no RBIs and 2 errors, including fumbling a fly ball, doesn't play 3rd base.
Eighth Inning
The player who had his 3 RBIs with a game-tying in-the-park home run that had the fans on their feet, scored at least 1 error, but he had fewer errors than the shortstop.

207,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
Three travelers, Al, Ben and Carl, came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote five three-letter words on a rock. The five words were HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
Then the troll asked Al, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Al, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Ben, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Ben, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Carl, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Carl, and the troll let him pass.
So, what is the password?","1. Ben used Al's answer, and Carl used both Al's and Ben's answers.
2. Al's letter could not have been E.","The password was HOE.
The only letters unique to one of the five words were D, H, P, R, and V. One of these letters must have been Al's, since he could determine the password. The only word without any of these letters is TOE. So the password could not have been TOE.
Ben knew this and now had four words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, P, R, T, and V. The password must have contained at least two unique letters, one for Al and the other for Ben, since they were both able to determine the password. The only word with only one of these letters was OAR. So OAR could not have been the password.
Carl knew this and now had three words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, O, P, T, and V. The password must have included three of these letters, since all three were able to determine the password. The only one of the three words containing three such letters was HOE, so this must have been the password.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-1.  What Al’s “Yes’’ tells us  
Al is given just one letter yet he already knows which of the five words is the
password.  
That can happen only if his letter occurs in exactly one of the five words.  
The letters having that property are

H (in HOE only) R (in OAR only) P (in PAD only) D (in PAD only) V (in VAT only)

Therefore the password is one of
HOE, OAR, PAD, VAT (the word TOE is impossible).

Step-2.  What Ben’s “Yes’’ adds  
Ben hears Al say “Yes’’ and now, with his own letter, also knows the word.

Let x be Ben’s letter.

• If x = O, the words still possible to him are HOE and OAR – two possibilities,  
  so he could not be sure.  Hence x ≠ O.  
• If x = A, the words possible are OAR, PAD and VAT – three possibilities,  
  so he could not be sure.  Hence x ≠ A.  
• If x = E, the only admissible word is HOE (because TOE has already been ruled
  out).  With E Ben would know the password, so HOE survives.  
• If x = T, the only admissible word is VAT (TOE already ruled out); with T Ben
  could also know the password, so VAT survives.  
• If x is one of the unique letters P or D, the only admissible word is PAD, so
  PAD also survives.

After Ben’s answer the candidates still in play are therefore  

HOE  (using Ben’s letter E)  
PAD  (using Ben’s letter P or D)  
VAT  (using Ben’s letter T)

Step-3.  What Carl’s “Yes’’ finally determines  
Carl has the last letter and has heard both earlier “Yes’’ answers.  
Call Carl’s letter y.

Since Carl ends up certain, only one of the three words above can be compatible
with what he knows.

Carl’s letter cannot be E, P, D or T (those letters are already accounted for
by Ben in the three surviving scenarios), so Carl must have O or A.

Case y = O.  
The only candidate containing O is HOE, so Carl would indeed know the word.
That is consistent.

Case y = A.  
Both PAD (letters P, A, D) and VAT (letters V, A, T) contain A and are still
compatible with the earlier answers, so with A Carl would still face two
possibilities and could not be certain.  Therefore y cannot be A.

Hence the only fully consistent situation is

Al receives H (unique, so he knows the word at once)  
Ben receives E (after Al’s reply he can tell it must be HOE)  
Carl receives O (after the first two replies he sees HOE is the only possibility)

Thus the password is the word HOE.

Final answer: HOE",True

However, they never crossed paths with each other. Why should that be so?",,"Adam was a Muslim, Ben was a Christian and Cyril was a Jew. Adam was born in 1309 of the Muslim calendar, Ben 1310 in the Christian calendar and Cyril 1311 in the Jewish calendar. Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. The wording looks as if Adam, Ben and Cyril are three ordinary men, but several details don’t fit that interpretation:
   • They were “born in 1309, 1310 and 1311”.  
   • All three spent their whole lives on the same road in old Jerusalem.  
   • Each lived more than sixty years and had “a full active life”, yet they never once crossed one another’s path.

2. If they were real people, that would be practically impossible.  
   In a medieval street three neighbours living simultaneously for more than sixty years would almost certainly see one another many times.

3. Therefore the puzzle must be using the words “born”, “lived”, “active life” and “never crossed paths” in some figurative sense.

4. A natural object that
   • can be “born” in a particular year,
   • can “live” for well over sixty years,
   • can be “active” (i.e. in use),
   • but can never “cross paths” with another of its kind
   is a house or other building.

5. Read the statement again with that idea:
   • Adam, Ben and Cyril are the names given to three houses.  
   • They were built (i.e. “born”) in the years 1309, 1310 and 1311.  
   • All three stand on the same road in old Jerusalem.  
   • They remained standing and inhabited for more than sixty years (“full active life”).  
   • Because buildings are stationary, they never physically cross one another’s path.

Conclusion  
Adam, Ben and Cyril are not people at all but three houses (or buildings) erected in 1309, 1310 and 1311. Buildings never move, so although they spent all their “lives” on the same street they could never meet or “cross paths”.

Final answer: Adam, Ben and Cyril are houses (buildings) erected in 1309, 1310 and 1311, so they never crossed paths because buildings don’t move.",True

If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:

Unfortunately the TV program started at that point so he never actually got around to doing it. Can you find the two possible solutions to Mad Ade's clock teaser?",,"Imagining the number on a clock face in a clockwise order they would be

We must keep six consecutive positions unchanged and still have every pair of neighbouring numbers (with wrap-around from 12 back to 1) add up to a prime.

Step 1 – which six positions can stay fixed?  
For two unchanged consecutive numbers k and k+1 their sum is 2k+1.  
2k+1 is composite for k = 4,7,10 (because 9,15,21 are not prime).  
Hence a block of six fixed positions may not contain any of the pairs 4–5, 7–8, 10–11 in its interior.  
There is only one block of six that avoids all three forbidden pairs:

………11  12  1  2  3  4………          (positions 11,12,1,2,3,4)

Conditions coming from “neighbouring sums are prime” are

4+a , a+b , b+c , c+d , d+e , e+f , f+11 are prime.

Parity helps: because every prime >2 is odd, neighbours must have opposite parity.  
Thus

a , c , e are odd (5,7,9)  
b , d , f are even (6,8,10)  

4+a is prime ⇒ a ≠ 5 (4+5=9), so a = 7 or 9.  
f+11 is prime ⇒ f ≠ 10 (10+11=21), so f = 6 or 8.

Now test the small number of possibilities (only parity-compatible pairs that give primes are used; e.g. 6 pairs with 5 or 7, 8 pairs with 5 or 9, 10 pairs with 7 or 9).

Each day from Monday, March 3rd, they all bet a dollar - Kevin bet on 2, Kate on 3 and Kathy on 3.5 doughnuts. Kathy won twice as many times as Kevin, who was right once more than Kate; sometimes there was no winner. By April, they all had $20 in their desks. How much was the most anyone could have had in their desk at the beginning of March?","The pot does not accumulate if there is no winner - each person gets his ""stake"" back.","$27
There would be 21 working days in a March where the first weekday is the third.  The combination of wins in which anyone will have lost the most money has a total of 19 wins (10 for Kathy, 5 for Kevin and 4 for Kate).  In this scenario, Kate would have lost 15 times ($15) and won 4 times ($8), for a net loss of $7.  Since she now has $20, she must have started with $27.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 x = number of days Kevin was right  
 y = number of days Kate was right  
 z = number of days Kathy was right  

We are told  
 z = 2x  (“Kathy won twice as many times as Kevin”)  
 x = y + 1 (“Kevin was right once more than Kate”)  
⇒ y = x – 1.

1.  Counting the betting days  
From Monday, March 3 to Monday, March 31 there are 21 weekdays, so  

 x + y + z ≤ 21.  
But x + y + z = x + (x – 1) + 2x = 4x – 1,  
so 4x – 1 ≤ 21  ⇒ x ≤ 5.  
Because y ≥ 0 we must also have x ≥ 1.  
Hence x can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2.  Money flow for one person  
Each worker bet $1 on every one of the 21 days, so each paid out $21 in stakes.  
When someone won, the whole $3 pot was paid to that person, so on a winning day he or she netted +$2 (got $3 back after staking $1).  
If nobody won, every bettor simply lost the $1 they had staked.

Let Sₖ, Sₐ, S_y be the amounts Kevin, Kate and Kathy had in their desks on March 1.

After the 21 days they all had $20 left, so for each person

 final = start – 21 + 3·(# wins)  
 20 = S – 21 + 3·(# wins)  
 S = 41 – 3·(# wins).

Therefore  
 Kevin: Sₖ = 41 – 3x  
 Kate:  Sₐ = 41 – 3y = 41 – 3(x – 1) = 44 – 3x  
 Kathy: S_y = 41 – 3z = 41 – 6x.

3.  Which starting amount can be greatest?  
For any admissible x (1 ≤ x ≤ 5) the three starting amounts are

 Kevin   41 – 3x  
 Kate    44 – 3x  
 Kathy   41 – 6x.

Kate’s amount is larger than Kevin’s by $3 and larger than Kathy’s by 3x – 3 ≥ 0, so the biggest desk-stash always belongs to Kate.  
To maximize her starting money we choose the smallest possible x (because her start decreases by $3 for every extra win):

 x = 1 → y = 0, z = 2.

Then

 Kate’s start = 44 – 3·1 = $41  
 Kevin’s start = 38  
 Kathy’s start = 35.

Thus the largest amount anyone could have had on March 1 is $41.

221,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.
Morris the Daft:
A) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.
B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.
Robby O'Mental:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.
Considering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?",,"Robby left the door open.
The one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.
There are only 3 truthful statements.
If Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.
If Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.
If Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.
In Robby's case, in detail:
Norris A True
B False
Nobby A True
B False
Morris A False
B True
Dave A False
B False (why did he bother to leave the
cell door open?)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

D = the guard who was on duty that evening  
L = the guard who left the door open (the story says the man on duty left it open, so L = D)

Eight statements were made; abbreviate them as follows.

1. Norris A : D ≠ Norris  
2. Norris B : D = Morris  
3. Nobby A : D ≠ Nobby  
4. Nobby B : D = Norris  
5. Morris A: D = Nobby  
6. Morris B: “ I hoped Torks would escape ”  
7. Robby A : D ≠ Robby  
8. Robby B : “ I was not surprised that Torks did not escape ”

From the introductory paragraph we are told

• “All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape.”

Therefore statement 6 is definitely TRUE.

We also know that exactly three of the eight statements are true.

Now test each possible guard for D = L.

──────────────────────────────────
1) Suppose D = Norris  
True statements among 1-5&7 are 3 (3,4,7).  
Adding the always-true statement 6 gives 4 truths – too many.  
So D ≠ Norris.

2) Suppose D = Nobby  
True statements among 1-5&7 are again 3 (1,5,7).  
Adding statement 6 again makes 4 truths – too many.  
So D ≠ Nobby.

3) Suppose D = Morris  
Statements 1,2,3,7 are true, already 4 truths – impossible.  
So D ≠ Morris.

4) Suppose D = Robby  
Statements 1 and 3 are true, 2,4,5,7 are false – that is 2 truths so far.  
Statement 6 is always true, bringing the total to 3.  
To keep the total at three, Robby B (statement 8) must be false.

This fits the “exactly three true” condition perfectly:

True : 1, 3, 6  
False: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

──────────────────────────────────

The only consistent arrangement is therefore

D = L = Robby O’Mental.

Hence the guard who left the cell door open – the guilty guard – was Robby O’Mental.

222,"John, Pete, Tom, George, and Steve are brothers. One day, one of them broke a window. When their father asked them who did it, they gave the following answers:

Pete: ""It was neither George nor me.""
Tom: ""Both of you are lying.""
Steve: ""No, only one of them is lying.""

Who broke the window?","If you find it difficult to use logic alone, then use trial and error by assuming each one of the five sons broke the window, and list whether they are telling a lie or the truth.","By assuming that each of the five brothers broke the window and seeing how many told the truth, only Tom can be the person who broke the window.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let B be the brother who actually broke the window.

Statements  
John (J): “B is Pete or Tom.”  
Pete (P): “B is neither George nor me.”  
Tom (T): “Both of you (John and Pete) are lying.”  
Steve (S): “No, only one of them is lying.”  
George (G): “No, Steve, you are wrong.”

Mother: Exactly three of these five statements are true.

Logical translations  
J is true ⇔ B ∈ {Pete, Tom}.  
P is true ⇔ B ∉ {George, Pete}.  
T is true ⇔ (J is false) ∧ (P is false).  
S is true ⇔ exactly one of {J, P} is false.  
G is true ⇔ S is false.

Consider the four possible truth-value pairs for (J, P):

1. J true, P true  
   ⇒ T false (both are not lying)  
   ⇒ S false (zero of them are lying)  
   ⇒ G true (because S false)  
   Truth count = 3 (J, P, G) ✔

   With J true, B ∈ {Pete, Tom}.  
   With P true, B ∉ {George, Pete}.  
   The only name satisfying both is Tom.  
   Hence B = Tom and all conditions are met.

2. J true, P false → only 2 true statements  
3. J false, P true → only 2 true statements  
4. J false, P false → only 2 true statements  

Only case 1 gives the required three truths.

Therefore the window breaker is Tom.

2.  Mum and Dad #1 divorced.  

3.  Mum then married Dad #2.  
    – Dad #2 legally adopted the three children who already existed, so we now had two fathers (our biological father #1 and our adoptive father #2).  
    – During that marriage Mum and Dad #2 had two more daughters (my two younger sisters).  

4.  Mum and Dad #2 eventually divorced, and Mum later married Dad #3 (the man she is married to now).

  That gives us 3 dads.

• The two younger sisters were born to Mum and Dad #2, so they have

Translate each sentence literally:

1. “The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.”  
   The shorter of {A,B} = OB.                                         (Eq 1)

2. “The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.”

3. “The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.”  
   The taller of {A,C} = YB.                                           (Eq 3)

Because there are only two boxers, the pair (OB , YB) must be some ordered pair of two different brothers, and the remaining brother is the non-boxer.  Test every possible assignment.

Case 1 : (OB , YB) = (A , B) (non-boxer C)

Eq 1 Shorter(A,B) = A  ⇒  A < B.  
Eq 3 Taller(A,C)  = B  – impossible (B is not A or C).  
Contradiction → Case 1 impossible.

Case 2 : (OB , YB) = (A , C) (non-boxer B)

Eq 1 Shorter(A,B) = A  ⇒  A < B.  
Eq 2 Younger(B,C) = SB; but SB is either A or C, never B or C.  Impossible.
Contradiction → Case 2 impossible.

Case 3 : (OB , YB) = (B , A) (non-boxer C)

Choose heights and ages that satisfy the equalities:

Let heights: B < A > C with, say, B=1, A=3, C=2.  
Let ages:    C > B > A (C oldest, A youngest).

Check the three sentences:

Eq 1 Shorter of A and B = B, and B is OB – satisfied.  
Eq 2 Younger of B and C = B, and B is SB – satisfied.  
Eq 3 Taller of A and C  = A, and A is YB – satisfied.

All three conditions hold, so this case is consistent.

Case 4 : (OB , YB) = (B , C) (non-boxer A)

Eq 1 Shorter(A,B) = B  ⇒  B < A.  
Eq 3 Taller(A,C)  = C  ⇒  C > A.  
Then C is taller than A, B shorter than A; consequently SB = B, but Eq 2 demands the younger of {B,C} be B, which is false because YB = C.  Contradiction.

Case 5 : (OB , YB) = (C , A) (non-boxer B)

Eq 1 requires the shorter of {A,B} be C – impossible (C∉{A,B}).  Contradiction.

Case 6 : (OB , YB) = (C , B) (non-boxer A)

228,"Henry and Gretchen are going to play a game.  Henry explains, ""You and I will take turns saying numbers.  The first person will say a number between 1 and 10.  Then the other person will say a number that is at least 1 higher than that number, and at most 10 higher.  We will keep going back and forth in this way until one of us says the number 50.  That person wins.  I'll start.""
""Not so fast!"" says Gretchen.  ""I want to win, so I will start.""
What number should Gretchen say to start?","By following this strategy, she is assured a victory.  Think of all of the numbers she will want to say.","She wants to say, ""6.""
The series of numbers she will say is 6, 17, 28, 39, 50.
Since she wants to say 50, she needs Henry to say a number between 40 and 49.  Therefore, she wants to say 39.
Knowing she wants to say 39, she needs Henry to say a number between 29 and 38.  So she wants to say 28.  Following this same logic recursively, she will want to say 17, and she will want to say 6 to start the game, and be assured victory.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Think of the game this way:  
Start at 0.  Each move a player adds 1–10 to the current total, and whoever first brings the total to 50 wins.

Key observation  
Because the allowed move-sizes run from 1 to 10, the two moves in one “pair of turns’’ can always sum to 11 (for example, if the opponent adds h, you can add 11 − h).  
Therefore, if you can leave the total at a number that is 11 less than 50, or 22 less than 50, etc., you can always force the next “pair of turns’’ to move the total up by exactly 11.

So the special (safe) totals are
50 − 11 = 39,  
50 − 22 = 28,  
50 − 33 = 17,  
50 − 44 = 6.

Strategy  
1. Start by moving the total to 6.  
2. Whatever Henry then adds (call it h, with 1 ≤ h ≤ 10), you add 11 − h.  
   – This brings the total to 17, then 28, then 39.  
3. After you say 39, Henry’s next number is between 40 and 49.  
   You can then add the remaining amount (between 1 and 10) to hit 50 and win.

Thus Gretchen must begin by saying 6.",True
229,"One of four people - two men (Jack and Mike) and two women (Carol and Lily) - was murdered.
The following facts refer to the people mentioned:
(a) Jack's sister argued exactly once with Carol's legal husband after the murder.
(b) Mike's sister argued twice with the victim's legal spouse after the murder. Who was the victim?",,"Mike is the victim.
If Mike's sister and Jack's sister are the same person, then (a) reads ""Lily argued exactly once with (Mike or Jack)"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with (the same Mike or Jack)"".  These two statements contradict each other.  Therefore Mike's sister must be different from Jack's sister.
If this is the case then there are two possibilities:
1)  Jack and Carol are brother and sister.  Mike and Lily are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Lily and Mike is married to Carol.  If this is the case, then (a) reads ""Carol argued once with Mike"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with herself"", leaving Jack dead.  Since Lily did not likely argue with herself, this is not the solution.
2)  Jack and Lily are brother and sister.  Mike and Carol are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Carol and Lily is married to Mike.  If this is the case, then (a) reads ""Lily argued once with Jack"" and (b) reads ""Carol argued twice with Lily"", leaving Mike dead.  Since there are no contradictions, this is the solution.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

  Sᴊ = Jack’s sister (Carol or Lily)  
  Sᴍ = Mike’s sister (Carol or Lily)  
  Hᴄ = Carol’s legal husband (Jack or Mike)  
  Sp = the victim’s legal spouse  

Everybody who appears in an argument (Sᴊ , Sᴍ , Hᴄ , Sp) is alive, hence none of them is the murder-victim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Jack’s sister cannot be Carol
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Assume Sᴊ = Carol.

Then Carol is alive, so the victim is one of {Jack , Mike , Lily}.  
Because Sᴊ argued with Hᴄ, Hᴄ is alive and therefore not the victim.

a)  If Hᴄ = Jack, then Jack is alive; the victim would have to be Mike or Lily.  
    But Sᴊ (=Carol) is married to Jack, so for her to be Mike’s (or Lily’s)
    sister she would have to be married to her own brother – an impossibility.

b)  If Hᴄ = Mike, then Mike is alive; the victim would have to be Jack or Lily.  
    In either sub-case the same person (Carol) would have to argue both
    “exactly once” and “exactly twice’’ with the very same man – impossible.

Hence Sᴊ cannot be Carol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Therefore Jack’s sister must be Lily
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So Sᴊ = Lily, and by (a) Lily argued once with Hᴄ.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Determine Carol’s husband
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If Hᴄ = Mike, Lily argued once with Mike.

But (b) says some woman (Sᴍ ) argued twice with the victim’s spouse.
If Sᴍ were Lily again she would have argued once and twice with the same
man; if Sᴍ were Carol then Carol would be both Mike’s sister and his wife,
which is impossible.  
Therefore Hᴄ ≠ Mike.  Consequently

   Hᴄ = Jack and Carol is Jack’s wife.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Identify Mike’s sister
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Since Lily is Jack’s sister, Mike’s sister must be the only other woman:

   Sᴍ = Carol  (Jack’s wife, Mike’s sister)

By (b): Carol argued twice with the victim’s spouse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Who can be the victim?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  Carol is alive (she took part in arguments) → not the victim.  
•  Jack is alive (he argued with Lily) → not the victim.  
•  Lily is alive (she argued with Jack) → not the victim.  

The only person who never appears alive in any argument is

   Mike.

Thus every condition is satisfied when

  Sᴊ = Lily (She argued once with Jack)  
  Sᴍ = Carol (She argued twice with Lily, Mike’s widow)

and Mike is the one who was murdered.

230,"Walter, Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke crossed a river in a tiny rowboat. They all started on the same side of the river. They made three trips from the starting side to the destination side, and two trips from the destination side to the starting side. Here are some facts:
1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?",,"Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.
Fact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi. Yoshi would have had to row back to row his trip to the destination side, or else Yoshi rowed to the destination side, then back to the start, then got rowed across by Xavier.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
231,"There is a famous diamond displayed in a room that measures 15 meters by 15 meters by 15 meters. The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?",,"Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies. With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Under the carpet the alarm-wires lie absolutely straight and parallel, one every 8 cm.  
If any single wire is loaded with more than 4 kg the alarm sounds, so Carlo must always have his weight spread over at least  

 74 kg ÷ 4 kg ≈ 18.5  ⇒  19 wires.

1. Make two “skis”.  
   • Saw the 5-metre 2 × 4 lengthwise, producing two planks 5 m long, about 5 cm wide and 5 cm thick.  
   • Nail or lash a pair of the leather straps to each plank as bindings so that a foot can be fastened to it.

2. Why the skis are safe.  
   The planks are placed on the carpet perpendicular to the run of the wires.  
   5 m = 500 cm ; 500 cm ÷ 8 cm ≈ 62.5, so each plank rests on about 63 different wires.  
   a) Standing on both skis: 74 kg is shared by 2 × 63 ≈ 126 wires → ≈ 0.6 kg per wire.  
   b) When one ski is lifted during a step the whole 74 kg is on one plank → 74 kg ÷ 63 ≈ 1.2 kg per wire.  
   Both cases are far below the 4 kg limit, so the alarm cannot be tripped.

3. Take the diamond.  
   • Carlo straps the skis to his shoes outside the carpeted area, steps onto the carpet and simply walks to the pedestal; the skis continually rest on sixty-odd new wires at every stride.  
   • He leans forward, breaks the glass with the hammer, pockets the diamond (its mass is negligible compared with his own), turns round and walks back the same way.  
   • The skis are removed once he is off the carpet.

Throughout the operation no wire ever carries more than about 1¼ kg, so the alarm never senses a 4 kg load and is never triggered.

Final answer: Carlo saws the 5-metre board lengthwise into two long, narrow planks, straps one to each foot like “skis”, and walks across the carpet; each plank spans about 63 alarm wires, so even when all his weight is on one ski each wire bears only ~1.2 kg—well below the 4 kg limit—letting him reach the diamond and return without setting off the alarm.",True
232,"One day, in baking class, 15 students were baking cakes when the fire alarm went off. Everyone exited the building, but when they got back, they found someone had dumped all the sugar into two of the batter-filled bowls.

To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.

Fact 4a tells us that in scenario 1, Mr. Froopaloop will marry Charlotte. Fact 4b tells us that in scenario 2, Mr. Froopaloop will marry...Charlotte.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

    Ab, Ar, At = Audrey’s eye-, hair-, and height-attributes  
    Bb, Br, Bt = Brenda’s attributes  
    Cb, Cr, Ct = Charlotte’s attributes  

(“True’’ = has the characteristic, “False’’ = doesn’t.)

1. Translating the statements

a) Ab = Bb                (blue eyes of Audrey & Brenda identical)  
   Bb ≠ Cb                (blue eyes differ for Brenda & Charlotte)  
⇒ Ab ≠ Cb                (Audrey’s blue opposite Charlotte’s)

b) Ar ≠ Br                (red hair differs for Audrey & Brenda)  
   Ar = Cr                (red hair identical for Audrey & Charlotte)  
⇒ Cr ≠ Br                

c) At ≠ Ct   and   Bt ≠ Ct   (height of Charlotte opposite both others)  
⇒ At = Bt (because both differ from the same Ct)

Thus we may pick three independent binary variables

  x = Ab                (blue of A)  
  y = Ar                (red  of A)  
  z = At                (height of A)

and then

Bb = x    Cb = ¬x  
Br = ¬y   Cr = y  
Bt = z    Ct = ¬z

2. Counting each woman’s characteristics

CountA = x + y + z  
CountB = x + (1–y) + z = x + 1 – y + z  
CountC = (1–x) + y + (1–z) = 2 + y – x – z

(Each “True’’ contributes 1.)

Enumerating the eight possibilities for (x, y, z) gives

x y z : (CountA, CountB, CountC)  
0 1 0 : (1, 0, 3)  
1 0 1 : (2, 3, 0)  
all six other triples : both a “1’’ and a “2’’ appear.

3. Applying Mr. Froopaloop’s rule

• If any woman has exactly TWO traits, he marries the one with the FEWEST traits.  
• If any woman has exactly ONE trait, he marries the one with the MOST traits.  
The two statements must not conflict, so we must avoid situations where both a “1’’ and a “2’’ occur simultaneously.

Exactly the two safe patterns are therefore

(0,1,0)  → counts (1,0,3)  
 A has 1, B has 0, C has 3.  
 Someone has “1’’ but nobody has “2’’ ⇒ rule (b) applies ⇒ marry the greatest ⇒ Charlotte.

(1,0,1)  → counts (2,3,0)  
 A has 2, B has 3, C has 0.  
 Someone has “2’’ but nobody has “1’’ ⇒ rule (a) applies ⇒ marry the least  ⇒ Charlotte.

In every logically consistent assignment Charlotte is the chosen bride.

235,"Just before the end of the term four high school students were discussing their chances for certain grades. The following remarks contain the gist of their hopes and fears.
Jack: We'll all get different grades. If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D.
Jean: If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D. Jack will get a better grade than Paul.
Lucy: If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C. If I get a B, then Paul won't get a D.
Paul: If Lucy gets an A, then I'll get a B. if Jean doesn't get a B, I won't either.
When the final examinations were graded and the term marks made out each of the four passed, and strange as it may seem, each received a grade that checked exactly with all the ideas they had previously expressed.
What grade did each receive?",,"Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul received B, A, D, and C, respectively.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning summary  
1. Let the grades be A (best), B, C, D (lowest).  Jack says all four grades are different, so A, B, C, D are each used once.  
2. Paul’s sentence “If Jean doesn’t get a B, I won’t either” implies: if Paul were to get B, Jean would also have to get B – impossible with distinct grades.  Therefore Paul’s grade is not B.  
3. Paul’s other sentence “If Lucy gets an A, I’ll get a B” then shows that Lucy cannot get A (because Paul cannot be B).  So Lucy ∈ {B, C, D}.  
4. Combine the rest of the implications:

   • If Jean ≠ A, Lucy insists that Jack must be C.  
   • Trying Jean ≠ A forces Jack = C, and an exhaustive check then shows Jack cannot be better than Paul, contradicting Jean’s direct statement that Jack beats Paul.  Hence Jean must be A.  

5. With Jean = A the remaining letters B, C, D go to Jack, Paul, Lucy (all different).  Paul is still not B, so consider the possibilities:

   • (J, L, P) = (B, C, D):  fails because L = C ⇒ J would have to be D.  
   • (J, L, P) = (C, B, D):  fails because L = B would force P ≠ D.  
   • (J, L, P) = (B, D, C):  every implication and direct statement is satisfied.

W = water (2),  
V = wine (2),  
H = hinder (heats you),  
C = help (cools you).

Step-by-step deduction

1.  “Poison is all you will get from the bottle on the far right” ⇒ position 9 = P.  
    “Each of the end bottles have the same contents” ⇒ position 1 = P.

2.  “No medium bottles are poison” ⇒ positions 4 and 7 ≠ P.  
    So the third poison must be somewhere else (not 4 or 7).

3.  “Neither big nor medium will save your life” ⇒ C is not Large or Medium ⇒ C is Small ⇒ C is at 2 or 5 (9 is already poison).

4.  “No matter how help hides, it will be on poison's left side, but its left side is safe.”  
    Thus we need a consecutive triple [safe][C][P].

    • If C were at 2, the triple would be positions 1-2-3, but 1 is poison, not safe ⇒ impossible.  
    • Therefore C is at position 5, and position 6 must be P while position 4 is safe.

    Now we have P at 1,6,9 (all three poisons located) and 4 is safe (not P).

5.  Remaining contents to place: 2 water, 2 wine, 1 hinder.

6.  “The hinder bottle is large” ⇒ H is at 3 or 8 (the only remaining large bottles).  
    “The hinderer … resides between wine and water” means H must sit between one Wine and one Water.

    H cannot be at 8 because 9 is poison, not wine or water, so  
    ⇒ position 3 = H.  

    Consequently positions 2 and 4 (the neighbours of 3) must be one wine and one water.

7.  “Water is next to the helper” ⇒ water is at 4 (because 6 is poison).  
    Therefore position 2 = wine.

8.  We have now used: P (1,6,9), C (5), H (3), W (4) and one Wine (2).  
    Still needed: one Water and one Wine, to be assigned to positions 7 (Medium) and 8 (Large).

    “Wine is bad in large doses, so none are large” ⇒ 8 cannot be wine ⇒ 8 = water.  
    Hence 7 = wine.

9.  “No two small bottles are the same” is satisfied:  
    Small bottles 2 (V), 5 (C), 9 (P) are all different.

All clues are met, giving the final list

1 L P 2 S V 3 L H 4 M W 5 S C 6 L P 7 M V 8 L W 9 S P

The only cooling (help) drink is in position 5, the middle small bottle.

You also know that a, b, c have the values 0, 1 and 2, but not necessarily in that order.
But to make matters more complicated the symbols + - * / have been mixed up: all you know is that each represents a different arithmetical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division).
Can you work out the values of a, b and c, and what each of the symbols actually mean?",The only thing you should assume about the arithmetical symbols is that no two represent the same operation.,"a = 1
b = 2

 • “+” , “–” , “*” , “/” each stand for a different one of  
  { addition, subtraction, multiplication, division }.  
 • (a , b , c) is a permutation of (0 , 1 , 2).

We have  

(1) a + c = a  
(2) b – c = c  
(3) c / b = c  
(4) a * a = b

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Analyse equation (1)

a + c = a means “+” is an operation for which x ◦ y = x.  
• For ordinary addition or subtraction this happens when y = 0.  
• For ordinary multiplication or division this happens when y = 1.

Hence  

 If “+” is {addition or subtraction} ⇒ c = 0  
 If “+” is {multiplication or division} ⇒ c = 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Try the cases

Case A c = 0  (so “+” is add or subtract)

Take “+” = subtraction (the other choice will turn out similar).

Now c = 0 and the symbols / , – , * have still to be assigned.

Equation (2): b – c = c  becomes b  ◦  0 = 0.  
The only ordinary operation giving x ◦ 0 = 0 for every x ≠ 0 is multiplication,  
so “–” must be multiplication.

Equation (3): c / b = c  is 0  ◦  b = 0.  
0 ÷ b = 0 works for division, so “/” is division.

The only unused operation is addition, so “*” must be addition.

Now equation (4) is a * a = b i.e. a + a = b → 2a = b.  
With {a , b} = {1 , 2} this forces a = 1 and b = 2.

Everything is distinct (a=1, b=2, c=0) and all four equations check:

1 − 0 = 1    ( “+” is subtraction )  
2 × 0 = 0    ( “–” is multiplication )  
0 ÷ 2 = 0    ( “/” is division )  
1 + 1 = 2    ( “*” is addition )

Case B c = 1  (makes “+” multiplication or division)  
and Case C with the other remaining assignments both lead to contradictions,
so they are impossible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Record the unique consistent assignment

Numbers: a = 1 , b = 2 , c = 0

Meanings of the symbols  
 “+” means subtraction  (x + y = x − y)  
 “–” means multiplication (x – y = x·y)  
 “/” means division    (x / y = x ÷ y)  
 “*” means addition    (x * y = x + y)

Final answer: a = 1, b = 2, c = 0;  “+” is subtraction, “–” is multiplication, “*” is addition, “/” is division",True
239,"You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

Write the code as AB-CD-EF-GH where each letter is a single digit (no leading 0’s).

Step 2 – use the easy digit clues  
Clue 2: digits may only be 0,1,6,7,8,9.  
Clue 1: EF = BA (the first set reversed).  
Clue 3: 4 × EF = GH (still two–digit).  
Clue 4: A + C = 8.  
Clue 5: CD ≤ 20 ⇒ C = 1 (the only allowed leading digit ≤20).  
Therefore A = 8 – C = 7.

Step 3 – determine the first and third sets  
A = 7, so the first set is 7B and the third set is B7.  
Since EF (=B7) must remain two–digit when multiplied by 4, test the possible digits B ∈ {1,6,7,8,9}:

17 × 4 = 68  ✔ two–digit  
67 × 4 = 268 ✘  
77 × 4 = 308 ✘  
87 × 4 = 348 ✘  
97 × 4 = 388 ✘  

Thus B = 1.  
First set: 71 Third set: 17 Fourth set: 68.

Step 4 – determine the second set with Clue 6  
CD can be 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19.  
Clue 6: (second digit of second set) × (second digit of fourth set) = one higher than the first set

Therefore CD = 19 (which is ≤20 and uses allowed digits).

241,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. Home-field schedule  
   • Games 1, 2, 6 and 7 were played in Los Angeles (Dodgers are the home team).  
   • Games 3, 4 and 5 were played in New York (Yankees are the home team).

2. A key fact about extra-inning games  
   When the home team wins in extra innings the game ends the moment it goes ahead, so the winning margin can only be 1, 2, 3 or 4 runs (a walk-off single to a grand-slam).  
   A margin of 5 or more runs in extra innings is therefore possible only if the VISITING team wins (it piles up runs in the top half of the inning and the home team fails to score in the bottom half).

3. Analyse Game 7  
   Game 7 (played in Los Angeles) went 13 innings and ended 13 – 8, a 5-run margin.  
   Because the margin is 5 and the game was in extra innings, the visiting team must have won.  
   The visiting team in Game 7 was the New York Yankees.  
   → Yankees won Game 7.

4. Consequence for the whole series  
   A World Series only reaches Game 7 if neither club has reached four wins after six games (the score is 3–3).  
   The Yankees’ victory in Game 7 therefore gives them their fourth win and the championship.  
   The Dodgers cannot have already had four wins (or the Series would have ended earlier), so they are the runners-up.

Hence the only possible champion is the New York Yankees.

Final answer: the New York Yankees won the Series.",True
242,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Reasoning

Let a = size of the smaller group, b = size of the larger group.  
a + b = 86 and a < b.

1. Statement (a): “A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.”

   The only way this can hold is if a quarter of the larger group exceeds the smaller group:
   b/4 > a  ⇔  b > 4a.

   Substituting b = 86 – a gives  
   86 – a > 4a  ⇔  86 > 5a  ⇔  a < 17.2, hence a ≤ 17.

2. The other four statements give arithmetical conditions on at least one of the two group–sizes:

   • divisible by 4 (statement d)  
   • divisible by 7 (because a 6 : 1 woman–to–man ratio requires a multiple of 7)  
   • even (all married couples)  
   • divisible by 9 (because an 8 : 1 under-50–to–50+ ratio needs a multiple of 9).

   We look for a ≤ 17 whose companion b = 86 – a lets every one of 4, 7, 9 be a divisor of at least one of {a,b} and that also satisfies b > 4a.

   Testing a = 4,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,17 quickly eliminates all except

   a = 14, b = 72 .

   Check:

   • b/4 = 72/4 = 18 > 14 (satisfies statement a)  
   • a = 14 is 7 × 2, so the smaller group can be 12 women and 2 men → 6 : 1 ratio (statement b).  
   • b = 72 is even, so it can consist entirely of married couples (statement c).  
   • b = 72 is divisible by 4 (statement d).  
   • b = 72 is divisible by 9; choose 64 people < 50 and 8 people ≥ 50 for an 8 : 1 ratio (statement e).

All five statements can thus be simultaneously true only with these numbers.

•  Because of rule 3, SD and BC are an inseparable pair; whenever the scooter carries SD somewhere it must carry BC as well, and when SD is on a bank BC must be there too.

•  The scooter can carry only two “objects’’ at a time and the driver counts as one of those objects.

•  A piece of cheese can be moved only if either MA or DD drives the scooter, for SD is always accompanied by BC and there is then no spare room for cheese.

 That is allowed, but look at the left bank: MA is present, DD absent, and C₁ , C₂ are still with MA.  
 This is the forbidden situation “MA + C – DD’’ (rule 2).  
 So DD cannot transport a Kebabrie piece either.

Hence no Kebabrie piece can ever be moved at all.

────────────────────────────────────────
Why no Chillirella can ever be moved

The argument is symmetric.

Case A – DD drives C₁ across.  
 Left bank afterwards: MA present, DD absent, and C₂ is still there ⇒ “MA + C – DD’’ (rule 2) is violated.

Case B – MA drives C₁ across.  
 Right bank afterwards: DD absent, MA present with C₁ ⇒ “MA + C – DD’’ (rule 2) is violated right away.

Thus no Chillirella piece can be moved either.

────────────────────────────────────────
Consequences

Since neither kind of cheese can be transported at all, the complete party can never be assembled on the far bank without breaking one of the three rules. Therefore the journey is impossible.

245,"The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no.
What was the question?",,Do you mind?,GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. We want a question to which the speaker replies “yes,” yet the intention of that “yes” is effectively “no.”

2. That can only happen if the question itself is framed in the negative or quasi-negative, so that an affirmative answer denies permission or expresses objection.  
   Example type:  
   “Do you mind if … ?”

3. In ordinary English usage:  
   • Question: “Do you mind (if I open the window)?”  
   • Answer “No” = “No, I don’t mind” → Permission granted.  
   • Answer “Yes” = “Yes, I do mind” → Permission refused (i.e., “no, don’t do it”).

4. Thus, when the speaker says “Yes,” what is meant is “I do mind,” which in practical terms is “No, you may not.”

5. Therefore the only natural question fitting the riddle is:  

   “Do you mind?” (or the fuller form “Do you mind if I … ?”).

Final answer: The question was “Do you mind (if I …)?”",True

247,"You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the nine–digit code be  

a₁ a₂ a₃ a₄ a₅ a₆ a₇ a₈ a₉ ,

where {a₁,…,a₉} = {1,…,9} and consecutive terms may not differ by 1.

1. The two partial-sum conditions  
   Σ₁⁵ aᵢ = 19 and Σ₅⁹ aᵢ = 27.

   Adding them gives  
   46 = (a₁+…+a₉) + a₅ = 45 + a₅  ⇒  a₅ = 1.

   Thus Σ₁⁴ aᵢ = 18 and Σ₆⁹ aᵢ = 26.

2. Positions 2 and 4 are {2,4}.  
   Two cases:

   • a₂ = 2, a₄ = 4  
     Then a₁ + a₃ = 18 – (2+4) = 12.  
     Because a₂ = 2, a₁ ≠ 1,3 and a₃ ≠ 1,3.  
     Because a₄ = 4, a₃ ≠ 3,5.  
     With digits {3,5,7,9} available (6,8 are reserved for places 6 and 8), the only pair summing to 12 and obeying the bans is a₁ = 5, a₃ = 7.  
     Hence the first four digits are 5-2-7-4.

   • a₂ = 4, a₄ = 2  
     Gives a₁ + a₃ = 12 again, but now a₁ ≠ 3,5 and a₃ ≠ 1,3,5, so no admissible pair exists.  
     Therefore this case is impossible.

   Thus the start of the code is fixed: 5 2 7 4 1 …

3. Positions 6 and 8 are {6,8}.  
   The unused digits are 3,6,8,9 and their sum is 26, matching the required Σ₆⁹ aᵢ = 26, so those four digits fill the last four places.

   Try a₆ = 6, a₈ = 8.  
   Then the remaining digits (3,9) must occupy positions 7 and 9.  
   Putting 3 at a₇ forces 9 at a₉, but 8 and 9 would then be consecutive (forbidden).  
   Putting 9 at a₇ is already ruled out because 8–9 would be consecutive.  
   Hence a₆ = 6 fails.

   Therefore a₆ = 8 and a₈ = 6.  
   Now the digits left are 3 and 9.

   • If a₇ = 9, then 8–9 is consecutive ⇒ forbidden.  
   • So a₇ = 3 and a₉ = 9.  
     Check adjacency:  
     1–8 (|7|), 8–3 (|5|), 3–6 (|3|), 6–9 (|3|) — none are consecutive.

   All conditions are satisfied.

Hence the unique permissible sequence is

About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.

""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.

Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""

""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Names of the two switches  

   switch A  – the “counter”  
   switch B  – the “waste-basket”

Initial fact known to everybody:  A = off,  B = off.

Designation of the prisoners  

   Prisoner 0 (the “leader” or “counter”)  
   Prisoners 1,2,…,22 (the “ordinary” prisoners)

Rules that will be followed for the rest of time

RULE for every ordinary prisoner j (1 ≤ j ≤ 22)

   Personal memory:  “Have I already performed my ONE duty on switch A?”

   • If the answer is “no” and, on entering, he sees switch A in the off
     position, he flips switch A from off to on and from that moment on
     changes his personal answer to “yes”.

   • In every other situation (that is, if his personal answer is already
     “yes”, or if his answer is “no” but he finds A already on), he ignores
     switch A and instead flips switch B (whatever its present state is).

RULE for the leader, prisoner 0

   The leader keeps an internal count C that begins at 0.

   • Whenever he enters the room and finds switch A on, he flips A from on
     to off and increases C by 1.

   • If he enters and finds A already off, he ignores A and flips switch B.

   • As soon as C reaches 22 he declares to the warden:
         “All 23 of us have visited the switch room.”

Why the declaration is always correct

1.  Only an ordinary prisoner is ever allowed to turn A from off to on, and
    each ordinary prisoner is permitted to do that exactly once.
    Therefore there are exactly 22 legitimate “off → on” events on switch A,
    each caused by a different ordinary prisoner on the first occasion that
    he finds A off.

2.  Only the leader is ever allowed to turn A from on to off, and he does so
    precisely once for each of the 22 “off → on” events.  
    Consequently the leader’s counter C is increased exactly once for each
    distinct ordinary prisoner who has visited the room at least once.

3.  When C finally reaches 22, every ordinary prisoner must already have
    visited the switch room (otherwise the corresponding “off → on” event
    could not have happened).  Hence at that moment all 23 prisoners have
    visited, so the declaration is true.

4.  Conversely, until every ordinary prisoner has visited, at least one of
    them has not yet performed his single “off → on” action, so the total
    of such actions is still below 22 and the leader’s counter C is below
    22.  Therefore the leader will not speak prematurely.

Why the declaration is eventually made

The warden’s condition “given enough time, everyone will eventually visit
the switch room as many times as everyone else” guarantees that each
ordinary prisoner will sooner or later enter on a day when switch A is off;
the leader resets A to off infinitely often, so the opportunity will
eventually arise for every prisoner who still owes his signal.  Hence all
22 signals will ultimately be sent, C will reach 22, and the leader will
announce.

All requirements are satisfied

•  Every visit results in exactly one switch being flipped.  
•  No communication other than the switches is needed after the first day.  
•  The strategy never risks an erroneous declaration, yet guarantees one in
   finite time.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as leader.  Each of the other 22
prisoners, the first time he ever enters the switch room and finds switch A
off, turns A on; thereafter he always flips switch B.  The leader always
turns A off when it is on and counts how many times he has done so; when
his count reaches 22 he announces that everyone has visited the switch
room.",True

1.  Consequences of the “sum” clues
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Clues 1 and 2 give  

 S₁ = A + B + C + D + E  is a multiple of 6,  
 S₂ = F + G + H + I + J  is a multiple of 5.

Because every digit 0-9 is used once,

  S₁ + S₂ = 0 + 1 + 2 + ⋯ + 9 = 45.

The only way to split 45 into a multiple of 6 and a multiple of 5 is

  S₁ = 30  and  S₂ = 15.                                        (1)

So

 F + G + H + I + J = 15.                                        (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Consequences of clue 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------
“IJ is a multiple of 10’’ forces the two–digit number IJ to end in 0, hence

  J = 0  and  I ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.                          (3)

With J = 0, (2) reduces to

  F + G + H + I = 15.                                            (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Using clues 7 and 10 on the pair (E,F)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Clue 10 tells us that FE is a two–digit prime, while clue 7 says that EF is a multiple of 7.
Searching the two–digit primes whose reverse is divisible by 7 gives exactly four
possibilities:

 (F,E) = (1,9), (4,1), (5,3), (8,9).

We shall treat them one at a time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Choosing (F,E) = (1,9)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Take F = 1,  E = 9   (so FE = 19 is prime, EF = 91 = 7·13).

With F fixed, (4) gives

  G + H + I = 14.                                                (5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Using clues 8 and 10 on (G,H,C)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Clue 8: GH is a multiple of 8.  
The two–digit multiples of 8 with distinct digits (and not containing 0 again) are  
 16, 24, 32, 48, 56, 64, 72, 96.

Because F,G,H,I must satisfy (5), look for triples {G,H,I} of distinct digits,
summing to 14 and containing one of the above ordered pairs (G,H):

 {2,4,8}  with GH = 24 or 48,  
 {2,5,7}  with GH = 72,  
 {3,5,6}  with GH = 56.

The set {2,4,8} with GH = 24 (G = 2, H = 4, I = 8) will shortly prove successful;
all other possibilities eventually contradict later clues, so we continue with

  G = 2,  H = 4,  I = 8.                                        (6)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  The pair (H,C) from clue 10 and the pair (C,D) from clue 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Clue 10: HC is prime ⇒ with H = 4, HC must be 41, 43 or 47.  
Thus C ∈ {1,3,7} and C must be odd.

Clue 6: CD is a multiple of 4.  
Therefore D is even and 10C + D ≡ 0 (mod 4).

If C = 1   ⇒ D would have to be 2, but 2 is already used (G = 2).  
If C = 3   ⇒ 30 + D ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ D = 6 (since 32 or 36 fit and 32 is impossible).  
If C = 7   ⇒ 70 + D ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ D = 6 (76 works).

Take the viable choice

  C = 3,  D = 6  (so HC = 43 is prime, CD = 36 is divisible by 4).    (7)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Fixing A and B with clues 3, 4 and 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Digits used so far: 0,1,2,3,4,6,8,9.  Remaining digits: 5 and 7.

Because J = 0, clue 10 makes JA = 0A = A, so A must itself be a (single-digit) prime:
A ∈ {5,7}.  The other remaining digit becomes B.

Clue 3: A + C + E + G + I must be a multiple of 9.

 For A = 5: 5 + 3 + 9 + 2 + 8 = 27  (multiple of 9) ✔  
 For A = 7: 7 + 3 + 9 + 2 + 8 = 29  (not a multiple of 9).

Hence

  A = 5,  B = 7.                                                (8)

Now check the remaining conditions:

•  Clue 5: AB = 57, and 57 is divisible by 3 ✔  
•  Clue 4: B + D + F + H + J = 7 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 18, an even number ✔  
•  Clues already used remain satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  The complete number
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We have now determined every digit:

 A = 5  B = 7  C = 3  D = 6  E = 9  
 F = 1  G = 2  H = 4  I = 8  J = 0.

Thus

  N = 5736912480.

9.  Verification of all clues
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) 5+7+3+6+9 = 30, a multiple of 6.  
2) 1+2+4+8+0 = 15, a multiple of 5.  
3) 5+3+9+2+8 = 27, a multiple of 9.  
4) 7+6+1+4+0 = 18, even.

7) 91 is divisible by 7.  
8) 24 is divisible by 8.  
9) 80 is divisible by 10.  
10) FE = 19 prime, HC = 43 prime, JA = 05 = 5 prime.

Step 1.  Use Condition 1  
Either A = B/3 (so B = 3A) or A = G + 3.

•  If A = B/3 then A can be only 1, 2 or 3 (because B ≤ 9).  
 For A = 1 we eventually run into the impossibility C ≤ 3 yet C = J + 2;  
 for A = 2, condition 6 forces F = 12 or F = −2, impossible;  
 for A = 3, condition 6 is again impossible.  
Hence the first alternative fails, so the second must hold:

A = G + 3     (1)

Thus G = A – 3 and 0 ≤ G ≤ 6.

Step 2.  Link G, F and I with Conditions 6 and 7

Condition 7: either G = F + 1 or G = I – 3.  

•  If we chose G = I – 3 then I = A and the digits repeat, impossible.  
 Hence we must have

G = F + 1.     (2)

With (1) this yields F = A – 4.  
Condition 6 therefore uses its second option, not the first.

So far A = G + 3, G = F + 1, F = A – 4.    (3)

Step 3.  Decide whether D = 4G or D = E/3  (Condition 4)

Because 4G is a single digit only when G = 0, 1, 2, we distinguish cases by the value of G (and hence A).

Case A = 4, G = 1, F = 0  
 Leads quickly to a contradiction (C must be ≤ 3, yet H = 3C would exceed 9).  
Case A = 5, G = 2, F = 1  
 This case survives every test; we continue with it.  
Cases A ≥ 6 give G ≥ 3 and force D = E/3 with repeated or oversized digits.  
Therefore only

A = 5, G = 2, F = 1    (4)

remains viable.

Step 4.  Determine D, E and J

With G = 2 the first alternative of Condition 4 works:

D = 4G = 8.    (5)

Condition 5 cannot use its second option (E = D/4 would repeat the digit 2), so it must use the first:

E = J – 1, hence J = E + 1.   (6)

Step 5.  Fix C and H via Conditions 3 and 8

Condition 3 may be C = F·3 or C = J + 2.  
Because F = 1, the choice C = 3 fits nicely, so we take

C = 3 (the option C = F·3).    (7)

Condition 8 cannot use H = A/2 (A/2 = 2.5), so it must use the other alternative:

H = 3C = 9.    (8)

Step 6.  Find I with Condition 9

Option I = H + 3 gives 12 (> 9), thus

I = D/2 = 8/2 = 4.    (9)

Step 7.  Complete B, E and J

Condition 2: either B = I – 4 or B = E + 4.  
Since I = 4, the first alternative yields

B = 0.    (10)

Now the unused digits are 6 and 7.  
Condition 10 offers J = H – 2 = 7 or J = 2C = 6.  
If J = 6 then E = 5 (from E = J – 1) which would repeat A; impossible.  
Therefore

J = 7, E = 6.    (11)

Step 8.  Verify uniqueness and all conditions

Digits obtained:  
A 5, B 0, C 3, D 8, E 6, F 1, G 2, H 9, I 4, J 7 – every digit 0-9 appears once.

Check every condition:

1. 5 = 2 + 3 ✔  
2. 0 = 4 – 4 ✔  
3. 3 = 1·3 ✔  
4. 8 = 2·4 ✔

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Label the vertices of a regular n-gon consecutively

5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.

2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Howard’s character

7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Tomatoes – five rows, planted on Monday May 27, in the west end of the garden.

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

Step-by-step deductions

1.  From I<J and I∈{4,8,9}, J∈{1,2,5,6,7}.  
    • If I=9, no J>9 is available.  
    • If I=8, again no J>8 is available.  
    ⇒ I must be 4, hence J∈{5,6,7} and 4 is no longer available elsewhere.

2.  Remove 4 from the other sets:  
    A∈{3,6,9}; B∈{1,2,6}; D∈{0,3,5,7}; H∈{1,2,6,8,9}.

3.  From A<B.  
    • If A=6 or 9, no admissible B is larger.  
    ⇒ A=3 and therefore B=6 (the only candidate larger than 3).  
    Digits 3 and 6 are now used.

4.  C<D with C∈{0,3,6}. (3,6 already taken) ⇒ C=0.  
    D must exceed 0; permissible D values are {5,7}. (4 not available)

5.  Digit 8 now appears only in E and H. (It was excluded from C earlier.)  

6.  Consider G<H.  
    Since G∈{1,2,9} and must be less than H, G cannot be 9.  
    ⇒ G is 1 or 2. We will examine G=1 first.

7.  Choose D=5 (we will soon see D=7 is also possible but fails).  
    Remaining unused digits: {2,7,8,9}.  
    • E∈{7,8,9}, F∈{7,9}, H∈{2,8,9}, J∈{5,7}.  
      Because J must be 5 or 7 and 5 is taken by D, J=7.  
      Then E cannot be 7, so take E=8 and consequently F=9 (since F>E).  
      H must then be 2.  All digits are now distinct.

8.  Check the sum condition.  
    First five digits: 3+6+0+5+8 = 22  
    Last five digits : 9+1+2+4+7 = 23  
    22 < 23 ✓

9.  Verify every single-digit clue:

    A=3 (T only)  
    B=6 (E only)  
    C=0 (C only)  
    D=5 (O only)  
    E=8 (C only)

    G=1 (O only)  
    H=2 (E only)

Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.

Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.

19,"Zachary has a private zoo.  He has five groups of animals in his zoo:  snakes, birds, mammals, insects, and spiders.  Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.  From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.
1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.
2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.
3) The most populous group has 10 more members than the least populous group.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)
15, 16, 17, 24, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
15, 16, 19, 22, 25 (15 insects & 22 birds)
15, 17, 18, 22, 25 (15 insects & 22 birds or 17 insects & 25 birds)
15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

  s = number of snakes  
  b = number of birds  
  m = number of mammals  
  i = number of insects  
  p = number of spiders  

(the totals include the single “odd” specimen in each class).

1.  Heads  

Every animal normally has one head.  
The unusual snake has 2 extra heads and the unusual bird has 1 extra head.  
Hence  

s + b + m + i + p + 3 = 100  ⇒  s + b + m + i + p = 97.  (1)

2.  Legs  

Let us start with the normal numbers of legs and then correct for the oddities.

normal total legs = 0s + 2b + 4m + 6i + 8p  
corrections: −1 (three–legged mammal) −2 (four–legged insect) −1 (seven–legged spider)

Therefore  

0s + 2b + 4m + 6i + 8p − 4 = 376  
⇔ 2b + 4m + 6i + 8p = 380  
⇔ b + 2m + 3i + 4p = 190.  (2)

3.  “Twice as many insect legs as bird legs”

Bird legs = 2b.  
Insect legs = 6i − 2.  

6i − 2 = 2(2b) ⇔ 6i = 4b + 2 ⇔ 3i = 2b + 1.  (3)

From (3) we see that b ≡ 1 (mod 3) and i is odd.

4.  “As many snake heads as spider heads”

Snake heads = (s − 1)·1 + 3 = s + 2.  
Spider heads = p.  

Hence s + 2 = p.  (4)

5.  Substitute p into (1) and (2):

From (4): p = s + 2.

(1): s + b + m + i + (s + 2) = 97 ⇒ 2s + b + m + i = 95.  (1′)

(2): b + 2m + 3i + 4(s + 2) = 190  
   b + 2m + 3i + 4s + 8 = 190 ⇒ b + 2m + 3i + 4s = 182.  (2′)

6.  Eliminate m by using (1′) in (2′).

From (1′): m = 95 − 2s − b − i.

Insert in (2′):

b + 2(95 − 2s − b − i) + 3i + 4s = 182  
⇒ −b + i + 190 = 182  
⇒ i = b − 8.  (5)

Combine (5) with (3):

3(b − 8) = 2b + 1 ⇒ 3b − 24 = 2b + 1 ⇒ b = 25.  
Then i = 25 − 8 = 17.

7.  Determine m from (1′):

2s + 25 + m + 17 = 95 ⇒ 2s + m = 53 ⇒ m = 53 − 2s.  (6)

With (4): p = s + 2.

So the counts are

snakes s  
birds  25  
mammals 53 − 2s  
insects 17  
spiders s + 2.

8.  Use the remaining conditions.

• All five numbers are distinct.  
• The largest count exceeds the smallest by exactly 10.

List the five numbers for 1 ≤ s ≤ 26 (so that m > 0).  
The only value of s that makes the spread exactly 10 while keeping all five numbers distinct is s = 19, giving

snakes 19  birds 25  
mammals 15 insects 17 spiders 21

Check:  
largest − smallest = 25 − 15 = 10 ✔  
distinct ✔  
snake heads = 19 + 2 = 21 = spider heads ✔  
insect legs = 6·17 − 2 = 100 = 2·50 = 2·(bird legs) ✔  
total heads = 97 + 3 = 100 ✔  
total legs = 0 + 50 + 59 + 100 + 167 = 376 ✔

All conditions are satisfied.

Final answer: 19 snakes, 25 birds, 15 mammals, 17 insects, and 21 spiders.",True
20,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,False

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Strategy (to be agreed upon the night before)

1. The rearmost islander (call him #10) will look at the nine hats in front of him and count how many of them are black. ‑  If that number is EVEN he will say the word   “white”. ‑  If that number is ODD   he will say the word   “black”.  
   (Thus his single word announces the parity – even or odd – of the number of black hats he sees.)

2. Every later speaker (numbers 9, 8, …, 1) will always keep in mind the parity that #10 announced and will continually update an “observed-parity” as the game proceeds.

   More precisely, just before a person has to speak he knows
   • what the original parity was (from #10’s word);  
   • the true colours of every hat already dealt with (because after each guess the monster’s reaction tells everyone whether that guess was right or wrong);  
   • the colours of all hats still in front of him (because he sees them).

   He therefore knows exactly how many black hats have already been removed from the line and how many black hats are still visible in front.  
   From this he can deduce what his own colour must be in order to make the combined total of black hats that were originally visible to #10 have the parity announced by #10.  
   He then says that colour, which is guaranteed to be correct.

Example  
Suppose the hats from front to back are  
     1 W 2 B 3 W 4 B 5 B 6 B 7 W 8 W 9 B 10 ?  
#10 sees five black hats (odd) and therefore says “black”.  
If #10’s own hat happens to be white he is eaten, but everyone now knows “original parity = odd”.  
Person 9 sees four black hats in front (even). For the total to stay odd his own hat must be black, so he says “black” and survives.  
Person 8 now knows there are five known black hats (odd) behind him and sees three black hats in front (odd); the total is even, so his own hat must be white. He says “white” and survives.  
And so on – everyone from #9 down to #1 will live.

Why this is optimal

• Only one word can be uttered by #10; that word can carry at most one bit of information.  
• Yet the ten possible configurations of his own hat (black/white) paired with the nine hats in front represent two equally likely possibilities for him. With no visual information about his own head, no strategy can let #10 be certain; his chance of living can be at most ½.  
• Our scheme lets each of the other nine people be absolutely certain, so exactly one person is in danger and the other nine are safe.  
Therefore no strategy can guarantee more than nine survivors, and this strategy attains that bound; it is optimal.

Survival summary

Guaranteed survivors: 9  
Expected survivors: 9 ½ (because #10 survives with probability ½).

Final answer:  The first speaker announces the parity (odd/even) of the black hats he sees; every later speaker keeps a running parity count and states the unique colour that restores the announced parity.  This guarantees that nine of the ten islanders live, which is the best possible strategy.",True
23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00        Derec

7:50        Caleb        0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

24,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the required 10–digit, 0–9 pandigital number be  

  A B C D E F G H I J .

All seven clues will be used systematically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Clue 6 ( A ⁄ G = G ⁄ C )

  G² = A·C,   with A,G,C different one–digit numbers.

  The only one–digit squares are 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,
  so we need a factorisation of one of these in one–digit factors,
  both different.  The possible ordered triples (A,C,G) are

  (1,4,2), (4,1,2), (1,9,3), (9,1,3),
  (1,6,4), (6,1,4), (2,8,4), (8,2,4),
  (4,9,6), (9,4,6).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Clue 5 ( C·H is prime )

  A product is prime only when one factor is 1 and the other is a
  prime digit (2,3,5,7).  Hence

  • if C = 1 then H ∈ {2,3,5,7};
  • if C ≠ 1 then H = 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Work through the candidate triples.

(a)  (1,4,2) C ≠ 1 ⟹ H = 1, duplicating A = 1 → reject.

(b)  (4,1,2) C = 1 ⟹ choose H ∈ {3,5,7}.  
  Continue with this promising triple.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Fix the digits already known

  A = 4, C = 1, G = 2, H ∈ {3,5,7}.               (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Clue 1 ( A + D is a square )

  4 + D ∈ {4,9,16}  →  D = 0 or D = 5.            (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Clue 2 ( G + J is triangular; Tn = n(n+1)/2 )

  2 + J ∈ {1,3,6,10,15} ⟹ J = 8 only.            (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Choose H and D

  H = 3 is the only choice that does not duplicate a digit
  when D = 5 (D = 0 will shortly be seen to fail).

  So take H = 3, D = 5.                         (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Digits used so far

  4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8  (A,C,G,H,D,J).  
  Available digits: 0,6,7,9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Clue 4 ( E·F odd )  ⇒  E and F are both odd.

  Hence {E,F} = {7,9}.                           (5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Clue 3 ( B + I even )  ⇒  B and I have the same parity.

  The remaining even digits are 0 and 6; they must therefore be
  {B,I}.                                         (6)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Clue 7 ( E + I = B + H )

  With H = 3, possibilities from (5) and (6) are:

  • (B,I) = (0,6): B + H = 3,   E + I ≥ 7 → impossible.  
  • (B,I) = (6,0): B + H = 9,   choose E = 9, I = 0.

  This satisfies E + I = 9 = B + H.              (7)

Thus the last two unused digits settle as  
  B = 6, I = 0, E = 9, F = 7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
12.  Collect all ten digits

 A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  
 4  6  1  5  9  7  2  3  0  8

--------------------------------------------------------------------
13.  Final check of every clue

1) A + D = 4 + 5 = 9, a square.  
2) G + J = 2 + 8 = 10, a triangular number (T₄).  
3) B + I = 6 + 0 = 6, even.  
4) E·F = 9·7 = 63, odd.  
5) C·H = 1·3 = 3, prime.  
6) A/G = 4/2 = 2 and G/C = 2/1 = 2.  
7) E + I = 9 + 0 = 9 equals B + H = 6 + 3 = 9.

All seven conditions are satisfied with distinct digits 0–9.

26,"Did you know that the mango is one of the world's most popular fruits? The mango is grown in North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, south and central Africa, as well as its native southern and south-east Asia.
The mango is also packed with vitamins A, B and C.
While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:
BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH
QUEST
QUICK
VIEUX
Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated","Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

29,"One day, an eccentric billionaire decided to give a destitute man a break. But not a total break, as we shall see. So, he invites him into a room in his mansion with seven doors. There is also a large-screen projector that projects the following five images, repeatedly, one at a time:
A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.
The poor man was allowed an entire day to study the images, after which he would have to choose the door that corresponded to the commonality of the images. The next day the man walked through the correct door, and the billionaire made him rich. What door did the man choose?","Take a snack break, have one of the images.","The man chose door number FOUR. Here's why:
The image of the human brain made the man think of 'four corners of the mind.'
He recognized the capital letters AZCONMUT to be the abbreviations of the 'Four corner states' Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. He completed the phrase
'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners. Thus, the poor guy walked into a mansion poorer than poor, and walked out with a cheese sandwich, and enough dough to buy a small country. What he actually did with the money is anybody's guess.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The millionaire’s pictures were not random: each of the five points of reference was meant to make the poor man think of the same single idea, namely the number 4.  Here is how each picture (or phrase) points to “four”.

1.  A human brain  
    ‑  The cerebrum is customarily divided into four principal lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital.

2.  Earth  
    ‑  The expression “the four corners of the earth” is the age-old way of referring to the whole world, and the globe is also navigated by the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

3.  The incomplete phrase “Fair and ____”  
    ‑  The ordinary completion is “square.”  A square is the plane figure distinguished by its four equal sides and four right angles.

4.  The letters AZ CO NM UT  
    ‑  Split into the standard U.S. postal abbreviations they are AZ (Arizona), CO (Colorado), NM (New Mexico) and UT (Utah).  Those four states meet at a single point called “The Four Corners.”

5.  A cheese sandwich on white bread with the crusts neatly cut off  
    ‑  A slice of sandwich bread is a square; trimming the crust means cutting off its four edges (or four corners).

Hence every clue—brain, earth, phrase, state abbreviations, sandwich—invokes the idea of “four,” “square,” or “four corners.”  

The billionaire said that one of the seven doors corresponded to the commonality of the clues.  Recognising that commonality as the number 4, the man walked through Door 4.

32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True

34,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True

37,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"We argue formally, using only deductive reasoning that every islander can (and does) carry out.

Notation  
• N = number of blue-eyed islanders.  
• “Night k” means the k-th night after the guru’s announcement.  
• Everyone is perfectly logical and knows everyone else is logical.  
• An islander will attempt to leave only when he/she can prove his/her own eye colour with certainty.

Step 1  (What the guru’s sentence achieves)  
Before the announcement no islander knows whether any blue eyes exist; after it, every islander knows

(∗) “There is at least one blue-eyed person.”

Moreover, (∗) becomes common knowledge: every islander knows it, knows that every other islander knows it, and so on.

Step 2  (Base case of induction)  
Suppose N = 1.

• That single blue-eyed person sees 0 blue eyes.  
• Using (∗) he reasons: “Someone must have blue eyes; the only possible candidate is me.”  
Hence he deduces his eyes are blue and leaves on night 1.

All other cases are empty because no one else has blue eyes. Thus the statement is true for N = 1: the lone blue-eyed islander leaves on the first night.

Step 3  (Inductive step)  
Assume the statement is true when there are exactly k blue-eyed islanders: then each of them leaves on night k, and no one leaves earlier.

Now consider the situation with N = k + 1 blue-eyed islanders, call them B1,…,B_{k+1}.

• Each Bi sees exactly k blue eyes.  
• He considers the hypothesis “I am not blue-eyed.”  
 Under that hypothesis there would be exactly k blue-eyed people, whom (by the induction hypothesis, a piece of knowledge he also possesses) would all leave on night k.

Therefore every Bi watches the first k nights.  
• If nothing happens on those k nights (and nothing does, because in reality there are k + 1 blue eyes), he can eliminate the hypothesis “I am not blue.”  
• Hence on the morning of day k + 1 each Bi can prove his own eyes are blue.

Consequently every blue-eyed islander boards the ship on night k + 1 together, and no one leaves earlier.  
This completes the induction: with N blue-eyed islanders, all and only those N leave, precisely on night N.

Step 4  (Applying the result to 200 islanders)  
Here N = 100.

Therefore

• Nights 1 through 99: nobody leaves.  
• Night 100: the 100 blue-eyed islanders, and they alone, now know their eyes are blue; each states “My eyes are blue,” boards the ship, and departs safely.  
• The 100 brown-eyed islanders and the green-eyed guru remain; they never obtain proof of having brown (or green) eyes, so they never leave.

Final answer: On the 100-th night after the guru’s statement, all 100 blue-eyed islanders leave the island together; no one else ever leaves.",True
38,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking.

If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?

Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N be the largest number of drops that we are willing to need in the worst case.

Suppose the first drop is made from floor x.  
If the ball survives we must still be able to make at most N-1 further drops, so the next step may be at most x−1 floors higher, i.e. at floor x+(x−1).  
If that also survives, the third step may be x−2 floors higher, and so on.

Hence, with N drops we can cover

x + (x−1) + (x−2) + … + 1 = x(x+1)/2 floors.

We need this to reach at least 100, and we want the smallest N possible.

x(x+1)/2 ≥ 100  
⇒ x² + x − 200 ≥ 0  
⇒ x ≈ 13.65

So the smallest integer x satisfying the inequality is 14, and therefore
N = 14 is the minimum worst-case number of drops attainable with two balls.

Explicit schedule (first ball)

1st drop 14  
2nd drop 14+13 = 27  
3rd drop 27+12 = 39  
4th drop 39+11 = 50  
5th drop 50+10 = 60  
6th drop 60+ 9 = 69  
7th drop 69+ 8 = 77  
8th drop 77+ 7 = 84  
9th drop 84+ 6 = 90  
10th drop 90+ 5 = 95  
11th drop 95+ 4 = 99  
12th drop 99+ 3 = 102 (building ends at 100, so use 100 instead)

Thus the floors to test with the first ball are
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.

Whenever the first ball breaks, say at floor f, we know the critical floor H lies between the previous safe floor and f−1.  
That interval contains at most 13, 12, …, 1 floors respectively, so the second ball can examine it in at most the remaining number of drops, keeping the overall total ≤ 14.

Therefore no matter where the true critical floor is, this schedule always determines it in at most fourteen drops, and fourteen is provably minimal.

Final answer: Drop the first ball successively from floors 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99 and (if still unbroken) 100; when (not if) the first ball finally breaks, search sequentially upward with the second ball from the last floor that was known safe. This strategy needs at most 14 drops in the worst case, and no strategy with two balls can do better.",True

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let R be the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves present on the evening when the Master makes his announcement.  
Because the statement  

 “there is at least one red hat and at least one blue hat”  

is common knowledge, every dwarf knows that every other dwarf … knows it, and so on.  
We analyse what happens for each possible value of R.

1.  Base case   R = 1  
 The unique red-hatted dwarf sees 99 blue hats and no red ones.  
 Since he nevertheless knows a red hat must exist, he realises at once that he himself is the red-hatted dwarf and does not return the next evening.  
 Thus all red hats disappear after 1 day.

2.  Inductive step  
 Assume that if exactly k red hats are present, all of them leave together after k days.  
 Now suppose R = k + 1.  
 Each red-hatted dwarf sees exactly k red hats among the others.  
 He reasons:

  “If my own hat were blue, the situation visible to those k red-hatted dwarves would be exactly the one covered by the induction hypothesis (namely, there would be k red hats in total).  
  Therefore each of those k dwarves would discover his redness and leave on night k.  
  If, however, night k passes and those k dwarves are still present, the only possible explanation is that my assumption was wrong—my hat cannot be blue. It must be red.”

 When night k passes uneventfully, every red-hatted dwarf reaches that conclusion, and all k + 1 of them stay away on night k + 1.  
 Hence, with k + 1 red hats, they all depart after k + 1 days.

3.  Conclusion  
 By mathematical induction, if the initial number of red hats is R, then all red-hatted dwarves leave after exactly R days.

Since the forest contains 100 dwarves and at least one of them wears a blue hat, 1 ≤ R ≤ 99.  
Therefore the process lasts

 • exactly R days,  
 • at most 99 days in the worst case.

Final answer:  after exactly R days, where R is the initial number of red-hatted dwarves (so no more than 99 days).",True

Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th.

5. I is not 1.",Start with casework on clue 2.,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"To satisfy the five conditions we must assign the nine different digits 1–9 to the nine letters  

A B C  
D E F  
G H I .

-------------------------------------------------
1.  E is a prime factor of G  

Among 1–9 only 2 or 3 can be a (proper) prime factor of another digit in the same range.  
The possible (E , G) pairs are therefore  
(2,4), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,9).

-------------------------------------------------
2.  B + G = H  

Since H itself is a digit (≤9), B + G ≤ 9.  
Therefore G can only be 4, 6, 8 (from the list above; 9 is impossible because then B ≥1 makes B+9 ≥10).  

We analyse each permitted G.

-------------------------------------------------
Case G = 8  (E = 2)  
Then B must be 1 and H = 9.  
Row 3 already totals at least 8+9+2 = 19, leaving at most 26 for Rows 1 and 2 together; but Row 2 has to exceed Row 3, which is impossible.  
So G ≠ 8.

Case G = 6  

• If E = 2,  B must be 1 or 3 (so H = 7 or 9).  
• If E = 3,  B must be 1 or 2 (so H = 7 or 8).  

In every sub-case Row 3 is at least 6+7+? = 15, yet the sum of Rows 1 and 2 is at most 30.  
Because Row 2 must be simultaneously larger than Row 3 and smaller than half that total, no arrangement works.  
Hence G ≠ 6.

Case G = 4  (E = 2)  
Now B + 4 = H and B, H are distinct digits ≤9, so the possibilities are  

(B,H) = (1,5), (3,7), (5,9).

•  (B,H) = (3,7) or (5,9)  
gives Row 3 ≥ 4+7+? = 16.  
Then Rows 1 and 2 total ≤ 29.  
But Row 2 would have to be both > 16 and < 14.5, impossible.  

Hence the only viable choice is  

B = 1 , H = 5.

-------------------------------------------------
With G = 4, E = 2, B = 1, H = 5 we have used the digits 1,2,4,5.  
The unused digits are 3,6,7,8,9.

Condition 5 forbids I = 1, so I ∈ {3,6,7,8,9}.  
Row 3 sum is 4 + 5 + I = 9 + I.

If I ≥ 6 then Row 3 ≥ 15, and Rows 1 and 2 sum ≤ 30, forcing Row 2 < 15 yet Row 2 > Row 3— impossible.  
Therefore

I = 3  and Row 3 = 12.

-------------------------------------------------
The digits left for A, C, D, F are 6, 7, 8, 9 with F > A (condition 3).

Row 1 = A + B + C = A + 1 + C  
Row 2 = D + E + F = D + 2 + F  
Row 1 + Row 2 must be 45 − 12 = 33.

Since the four remaining digits sum to 30, Row 1 + Row 2 is automatically 33 (adding the fixed +1+2).  
Row 1 > Row 2 translates to  
(A + C + 1) > (D + F + 2)  ⇒  (A + C) ≥ (D + F) + 2.

To satisfy this and F > A we choose  

A = 7, C = 9  (sum 16)  
D = 6, F = 8  (sum 14, and 8 > 7).

All conditions are now met:

Row 1: 7 + 1 + 9 = 17  
Row 2: 6 + 2 + 8 = 16  
Row 3: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12  
and 17 > 16 > 12 as required.

-------------------------------------------------
The complete (and unique) assignment is

A = 7 B = 1 C = 9  
D = 6 E = 2 F = 8

47,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

","Cliff Hedge is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:

Race #1 to Race #5 - Divide the horses into 5 groups of 5. Race each group to rank the first 3 in each - that's 5 races.
Race #6 - Race the winner from each group. The winner in this race is the fastest horse.
Race #7 - Race the second and third horses from the race in which the fastest horse raced initially,
the first and second horses from the group of the second horse in Race #6, and the third horse in Race #6 (that's a total of 5 horses).
The first and second horses in Race #7 are the second and third horses of the entire stable.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the 25 horses be split arbitrarily into five groups of five:  
A = {A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄, A₅}, B = {B₁, … , B₅}, C = {C₁, … , C₅}, D = {D₁, … , D₅}, E = {E₁, … , E₅}.  
Within each letter the subscript records the order in which the horses of that group will finish whenever they are raced together (so A₁ is faster than A₂, etc.).

Step-by-step schedule  

Race 1–5 (5 races)  
Race every group once.  We now know the complete order inside every letter–group:

 A₁ < A₂ < A₃ < A₄ < A₅  
 B₁ < B₂ < B₃ < B₄ < B₅  
 C₁ < C₂ < C₃ < C₄ < C₅  
 D₁ < D₂ < D₃ < D₄ < D₅  
 E₁ < E₂ < E₃ < E₄ < E₅

Race 6 (1 race)  
Race the five group–winners A₁,B₁,C₁,D₁,E₁.  Suppose they finish

 A₁ < B₁ < C₁ < D₁ < E₁.

Consequence of Race 6  
Because D₁ is at best 4th overall, every horse in group D (D₁–D₅) is worse than 4th; likewise every horse in group E is worse than 5th.  Hence none of the D’s or E’s can be among the three fastest.

The only horses that can still occupy the overall medals are

 A₁, A₂, A₃ (from the same group as the current leader A₁)  
 B₁, B₂   (from the same group as the current second place B₁)  
 C₁     (the current third place)

That is exactly six horses.

Race 7 (1 race)  
Race A₂, A₃, B₁, B₂, C₁.  
• The winner of this race is the second-fastest horse overall.*  
• The runner-up of this race is the third-fastest horse overall.*

(*A₁ is already known to be the overall winner.)

After Race 7 the complete order of the three fastest horses is known.

Why seven races are necessary  

1. At least five races are needed just to let every horse run once (the track has only five lanes).  
2. After those five races, no information is known about how any horse compares with a horse from a different initial group, so one further race (the winners’ race) is indispensable.  
3. Even after that sixth race, it is still uncertain which horses are 2nd and 3rd; at least one more comparison race among the remaining candidates is unavoidable. Hence a seventh race is required.  
4. The procedure above actually settles the question in exactly seven races, so seven is both necessary and sufficient.

50,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx . Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.
4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.
5) For inactive machines, turn D off and E on.
6) For active machines, turn A and B on, and turn C off.
7) Wait enough time for machine connected to C switch to cool off, and then turn B off, too.
8) Go inside.
9) The only machine that is still working inside is connected to outside switch A.
10) Check both machines that were active and are now turned off. The one that is warmer is connected to switch B (since it was on most recently), and the cooler one is connected to switch C (which was turned off first).
11) Turn inside switches on for both 'inactive' machines. The one that starts working is connected to outside switch E. The one that is still not working is connected to outside switch D.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"1.  While he is still in the machine–room the brother makes sure that  
    every machine-switch on the machines themselves is left ON.  
    (Thus a machine will run whenever its outside back-up switch is ON and
    will stop whenever that back-up switch is OFF.)

2.  He now leaves the room and closes the door behind him.  
    From this moment on he will work only with the five back-up switches
    that are in the passageway.

3.  Outside he at once puts ALL five back-up switches to OFF.  
    Every saw therefore stops and, from that moment, all five machines
    begin to cool.

4.  He now gives each back-up switch a different running-time before he
    finally returns to the room.

        • Switch A ‑- immediately turn ON and let it stay ON for 16 minutes.  
        • Switch B ‑- after 8 minutes turn it ON and let it stay ON for 8 minutes.  
        • Switch C ‑- after 12 minutes ( i.e. 4 min before the end ) turn it ON
          and let it stay ON for 4 minutes.  
        • Switch D ‑- after 14 minutes turn it ON and let it stay ON for the
          last 2 minutes.  
        • Switch E ‑- leave OFF the whole time.

    At the end of the 16-minute programme four switches (A–D) are ON and
    one switch (E) is still OFF, and the brother immediately re-enters the
    machine-room.

5.  What he now finds inside

        • One machine is still standing still and cold – it is fed through
          the switch that was never turned back ON (switch E).

        • Of the four machines that are running, their casings are all
          distinctly warm, but to quite different degrees:

              hottest  : the one that has been running 16 min  → switch A  
              next hot : the one that has been running  8 min  → switch B  
              next     : the one that has been running  4 min  → switch C  
              coolest  : the one that has been running  2 min  → switch D  

    A quick touch of the metal housings (or of the bearings, motor-blocks,
    etc.) is enough to put the four running machines into that order of
    temperature, and the standing machine is seen at a glance.

6.  The brother therefore walks back into the passage and, without any
    possibility of error, writes the correct label on each of the five
    back-up switches:

        switch A  → hottest machine  
        switch B  → second hottest  
        switch C  → third hottest  
        switch D  → coolest running machine  
        switch E  → machine that is still stopped

He has matched every outside switch with its own machine, having relied
solely on operating the switches and on the different amounts of heat
each machine acquired while it alone (or longest) was allowed to run.

Final answer:  By turning all five back-up switches off, then turning them
back on at different, carefully timed intervals (16 min, 8 min, 4 min,
2 min, 0 min), and finally feeling the comparative warmth of the machines
when he re-enters, the brother can identify which outside switch controls
which of the five machines.",True

6) Diddy Dewit and Polly Ester-Phants stood to the left of the main culprit
7) Six suspects stood between Chris Mass and Ewan Watarmy
8) Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Diddy Dewit
Who is the main culprit?
","Start with clues 7, 5, 2 and 8 together","Suspects from left to right: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass
Let's number the positions 1 to 11 from left to right. Hence, the main culprit is at position 6. Now, looking at the clues 7, 5, 2 and 8 together:
Position 1 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 3 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 4 - Ewan Watarmy
Position 5 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 7 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 11 - Chris Mass
From clue (3), the only possible positions for Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are Position 2 and Position 10.
Now there are 3 positions remaining - 6, 8 and 9 and remaining 3 suspects are Hugo Phurst, Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick. But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.
Suspects from left to right are: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass.
Thus,
Diddy Dewit (1), Ewan Watarmy (4), Hugo Phurst (6), Lou Stooth (7) and Chris Mass (11) are the suspects whose positions are fixed.
Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are at position 2 or 10.
Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants are at position 3 or 5.
Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick are at position 8 or 9.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the 11 suspects stand in a straight line, positions numbered 1 (extreme left) to 11 (extreme right).  
Because the police asked the culprit to stand in the centre, the main culprit occupies position 6.

1.  “Barb Dwyre and Chris Mass stood to the right of the main culprit.”  
   ⇒ Barb (B) and Chris (C) are in positions 7–11, with C still unknown.

2.  “Seven suspects stood between Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits.”  
   ⇒ Their positions differ by 8, so the only possible pairs are (1, 9), (2, 10) or (3, 11).

3.  “Six suspects stood between Chris Mass and Ewan Watarmy.”  
   ⇒ Their positions differ by 7, giving the pairs (1, 8), (2, 9), (3, 10) or (4, 11).  
   But Chris is right of the culprit, hence C ∈ {8, 9, 10, 11} and Ewan (E) ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}.  
   E cannot be at 1 (needs neighbours on both sides for condition 5, below), so the viable pairs are (2, 9), (3, 10) or (4, 11).

4.  “Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants stood either side of Ewan Watarmy.”  
   ⇒ R and P are adjacent to E, with E in the middle.  Hence E cannot be at an end; E = 2, 3, or 4 only.

5.  “Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Diddy Dewit,” and  
   “Diddy Dewit and Polly Ester-Phants stood to the left of the main culprit.”  
   ⇒ D is three places from E, and both D and P are in positions 1-5.

6.  Try each potential position for E:

   • E = 2 (⇒ C = 9): then D must be at 5.  
     But we also need two between E and Lou (condition 2) so Lou would be at 5, already occupied.  Impossible.

   • E = 3 (⇒ C = 10): then D must be at 6, but position 6 is the culprit.  Impossible.

   • E = 4 (⇒ C = 11): then D = 1 (three left of 4).  
     Condition 2 now forces Lou (L) to be three to the right of E, i.e. at 7.  
     All constraints up to now are satisfied.

   At this point we have

     1  Diddy  
     2  ___  
     3  ___  
     4  Ewan  
     5  ___  
     6  (culprit)  
     7  Lou  
     8  ___  
     9  ___  
    10  ___  
    11  Chris

   with P and R in {3, 5}, one on each side of E.

7.  The “seven between” condition for Mike (M) and Phil (Ph) can now only be fulfilled by putting them at 2 and 10 (in either order); (1, 9) is blocked by D at 1, and (3, 11) is blocked by C at 11.

8.  Barb must be right of the culprit, i.e. in {8, 9, 10}.  Slot 10 is already Mike or Phil, so Barb is 8 or 9.

9.  We still have Gerry (G) and Hugo (H) to place, with the rule “Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst.”  
   The open positions are 6 (culprit), 8, 9.  If we place Hugo elsewhere than 6, we run out of space for both Gerry and Barb to lie to his right.  
   Therefore set

     6  Hugo (the main culprit)

   then put Gerry right of him (8 or 9) and Barb in the remaining right-hand slot.  Both orders work (G 8/B 9 or B 8/G 9).

10.  Fill the two spaces 3 and 5 with Polly and Robin (either order).  

Every original statement is now satisfied:

• Barb and Chris (8/9 and 11) are right of the culprit (6).  
• Two between Ewan (4) and Lou (7).  
• Seven between Mike (2/10) and Phil (10/2).  
• Gerry (8/9) right of Hugo (6).  
• Polly and Robin flank Ewan.  
• Diddy and Polly lie left of the culprit.  
• Six between Chris (11) and Ewan (4).  
• Two between Ewan (4) and Diddy (1).

Hence the only consistent possibility is that

Position 6, the centre of the line-up, contains Hugo Phurst.

Put one queen in each rank as follows

Rank 1 : A1

Rank 3 : H3  
Rank 4 : F4  
Rank 5 : C5  
Rank 6 : G6  
Rank 7 : B7  
Rank 8 : D8  

(So the columns, in order of the ranks 1→8, are 1, 5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 2, 4.)

Why this works  

1. Rows.  Each rank contains exactly one queen by construction, so no two queens share a row.  
2. Columns.  All eight columns A–H appear exactly once in the list, so no two queens share a column.  
3. Diagonals.  Two queens attack each other along a diagonal precisely when the absolute difference of their ranks equals the absolute difference of their files.  
   For every pair of ranks (r₁,r₂) in the placement above, the corresponding column numbers (c₁,c₂) satisfy |r₁ − r₂| ≠ |c₁ − c₂|:

   • Example: ranks 1 and 4 give |1−4| = 3, columns 1 and 6 give |1−6| = 5; 3 ≠ 5.  
   • Checking each of the 28 possible pairs (or observing that the permutation 1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4 has no equal differences) shows this inequality always holds. Hence no two queens lie on the same diagonal.

Since the eight queens share neither a row, column, nor diagonal, none can capture another.  Therefore the arrangement above is a valid solution to the Eight Queens puzzle.

Boris Paley, liar
Chuck Thomson, truthteller
Dalman Paley, liar

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.  By elimination, Chuck is a Thompson.

54,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The plan is not reasonable.

Reasoning  

1. Water lost for one complete passage of a craft  
   • Every time a boat negotiates the flight the 13 locks are each emptied once.  
   • Loss per lock = 7 000 L  
   • Total loss per passage = 13 × 7 000 L = 91 000 L  

2. What one lorry can carry  
   • 1 t of water = 1 000 L  
   • Capacity of the hired tanker = 22 t = 22 000 L  

3. Comparison  
   • Fraction of the loss replaced by one load = 22 000 L / 91 000 L ≈ 0.24  
   • Hence you need a little over four full loads of the tanker to replace the water that a single boat costs the canal.  

4. Consequences  
   • Two boats in a day would require about 8–9 journeys; ten boats (not unusual on a popular canal) would need more than 40 journeys.  
   • Continually sending a 22-ton lorry up and down the hill scores very badly in cost, time, fuel and road wear compared with simply pumping the water or installing even a modest back-pumping station.

Therefore the arrangement could not keep the canal in use in any ordinary traffic situation, and the contract to supply the summit pound by road tanker is not a practical or economical solution.  

Final answer: The contract is not reasonable; a 22-ton tanker replaces only about one-quarter of the water lost each time a boat uses the 13-lock flight, so several lorry trips would be required for every single boat, making the scheme impractical.",True

5. X is a square number.
6. If X is less than 3, then the previous statement is false.
7. If X is greater than 2, then the previous statement is false.
Which statements are true?","All of the statements involve X in them, but some of the statements give direct information about whether they're true or not, and also potential hints for X.","If X is 2, then statements 2 and 3 create a paradox. Therefore, X is not 2, so statements 2 and 3 are both true because the ""if"" part is not satisfied.
Therefore, statement 6 must be true, because if X is less than 3, we know X must be 2. In this case, statement 5 is false.
However, because statement 6 is true, there are at least 3 true statements, meaning we can't conclude if statement 5 is false based on this statement alone.
Statement 7 is false because X is definitely greater than 2, and the previous statement was true.
Statement 1 and 4 must be false, because their truth will imply their falseness.
For example, if statement 4 was true, then it won't be satisfied anymore (as there are at least 4 statements true), so it can't be true.
But statement 5 must then be true, else statements 1 and 4 will become true.
Conveniently, X is 4, and is a square number, as statement 5 implies.
Therefore, statements 2, 3, 5, 6 are true.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let S₁,…,S₇ denote the seven statements and let  
X = the number of true statements among them.

S₁ :  “X is 3.”  
S₂ :  “If X = 2, then S₃ is false.”  
S₃ :  “If X = 2, then S₂ is true.”  
S₄ :  “X is less than 4.”  
S₅ :  “X is a square number.”  
S₆ :  “If X < 3, then S₅ is false.”  
S₇ :  “If X > 2, then S₆ is false.”

Step 1.  Show that X ≠ 0,1,2,3.

•  If X = 0 or 1, then S₄ must be true (because 0 < 4 and 1 < 4), giving at least one true
   statement, contradicting X = 0, and forcing X ≥ 2 if X = 1; both cases are impossible.

•  If X = 2, the antecedent “X = 2” is true in both S₂ and S₃, so  

        S₂ ⟺ “S₃ is false”,  
        S₃ ⟺ “S₂ is true”.

   This yields the equations t₂ = ¬t₃ and t₃ = t₂, which have no solution.
   Hence X ≠ 2.

•  If X = 3, S₄ is true (3 < 4) and S₁ is true (it asserts X = 3).
   With X ≠ 2, the antecedent in both S₂ and S₃ is false, so S₂ and S₃
   are both vacuously true.  That already gives four true statements,
   contradicting X = 3.  Hence X ≠ 3.

Therefore S₄ must be false and X ≥ 4.

Step 2.  Consequences of X ≥ 4.

Because X ≠ 2, the antecedent in S₂ and S₃ is false, so S₂ and S₃ are
both vacuously true.  
Also X ≥ 4 ⇒ X > 2, so the antecedent in S₇ is true.

So far we have  
 S₁ false (since X ≠ 3),  
 S₂ true,  
 S₃ true,  
 S₄ false.

Step 3.  Test the remaining possible values of X (4,5,6,7).

(a)  X = 4  
     •  S₅ : 4 is a square ⇒ S₅ true.  
     •  S₆ : antecedent (X < 3) is false ⇒ S₆ true.  
     •  S₇ : antecedent true, consequent “S₆ is false” is wrong ⇒ S₇ false.  
     True statements: S₂, S₃, S₅, S₆ = 4 truths = X.  Consistent.

(b)  X = 5,6,7  
     4 is the only square ≤ 7, so S₅ is false.  
     As before, S₆ is true and S₇ is false.  
     Thus only three statements (S₂,S₃,S₆) are true, contradicting X = 5,6,7.

Hence the unique consistent value is X = 4.

Step 4.  Truth status of each statement when X = 4.

S₁: false (Says X = 3)  
S₂: true  (antecedent false)  
S₃: true  (antecedent false)  
S₄: false (4 is not < 4)  
S₅: true  (4 is a square)  
S₆: true  (antecedent false)  
S₇: false (antecedent true, but S₆ is not false)

There are exactly four true statements, matching X = 4.

57,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The second contractor did not really give three different “prices” for exactly the same service.  
What he gave the Emperor was three ​voluntary​ payments that the Emperor himself could choose ​after​ the bridge was finished, each payment corresponding to how well the Emperor thought the job had been done.

The proposal ran roughly like this.

1. “When the bridge is finished, Your Majesty will decide what it was worth to you.  
   • If you think my work is poor or barely usable, you may give me only $200 000.  
   • If you think it is merely ordinary – no better than the bridge the other firm would have built for \$800 000 – give me \$750 000 (still \$50 000 less than their bid).  
   • If you judge the bridge to be first-class, built on time, strong enough for anything your country is ever likely to need and attractive enough to impress tourists, pay me the full \$1 000 000.  
   The choice will be yours alone; I shall accept it without protest.”

Because the whole risk was placed on the builder and none on the Emperor, the offer “sounded so good”:  

• In the worst possible case the Emperor would still get a bridge for only \$200 000.  
• In the average case he would save \$50 000 compared with Company A’s price.  
• Only if the bridge turned out to be outstanding would he pay the contractor’s original figure of \$1 000 000—and even then that payment would be entirely his own decision.

Contractor B then set out to build the best bridge he could possibly build: finished ahead of schedule, beautifully engineered, and obviously much stronger and more elegant than anything the Emperor had imagined.  
When the work was complete the Emperor, himself an honest man, judged that the bridge was indeed worth the maximum figure and voluntarily chose the \$1 000 000 payment.

Thus

• The offer attracted the Emperor because it left him free to pay less than the competitor’s bid if he were in any way disappointed.  
• Company B ended up with the highest amount because it delivered such superior quality that the Emperor, acting in good faith, decided the job deserved the top payment.

58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.

1.  Condition coming from the “families–division” proposal  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two pairs of sisters, i.e. 4 sisters altogether; every other
person forms a one–person family.  
Hence  

number of families  f = (2 sister-families) + (n – 4 singletons) = n – 2.

Norha said that under a family-division each family would get 5 tokens
more than each individual had just received:

        T / (n – 2)  =  T / n  +  5.                (1)

Multiply (1) by n(n – 2):

        T n  =  T (n – 2)  +  5 n (n – 2)  
   ⇒    2T   =  5 n (n – 2).                        (2)

2.  Integrality requirements  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)  T is an integer.  
(b)  k = T / n must be an integer.  
(c)  After Wendy refuses her share, the k tokens she relinquishes have
     to be divided equally among the remaining n – 1 friends; therefore  

     k must be divisible by n – 1.                    (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Solving (2) with n < 10  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Equation (2) gives  

        T = 5 n (n – 2) / 2.

For T to be integral, 5 n (n – 2) must be even, so n must be even.
With n < 10 the only even candidates are n = 6 and n = 8.

• n = 6 :  T = 5·6·4 / 2 = 60,  so k = T/n = 10.  
  Check (3):  k = 10 divisible by n – 1 = 5  ✔

• n = 8 :  T = 5·8·6 / 2 = 120, so k = 15.  
  Check (3):  15 divisible by n – 1 = 7  ✘

Hence the only possible size of the group is  

        n = 6  friends,  with  T = 60  tokens and  k = 10  tokens each.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  The final redistribution after Wendy’s refusal  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Wendy gives up her 10 tokens.  
These 10 tokens are shared equally among the remaining 5 friends, so
each of them receives an extra 10 / 5 = 2 tokens.

Final holdings  
• Wendy : 0 tokens  
• Each of the other 5 friends : 10 + 2 = 12 tokens

At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest

61,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True
62,"Edgar, Frank, and George are regulars at a pub. All three of them have been regulars since before this month.
1. One regular goes to the pub every two days, one goes every three days, and one goes every seven days.
2. The first day of a certain month that Edgar went to the bar was a Monday. The first day of the same month that Frank went to the bar was a Wednesday. The first day of the same month that George went to the bar was a Friday.

From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd. This gives us two possible scenarios:
1. Edgar went to the pub on Monday the 1st and every two days thereafter, Frank went on Wednesday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and George went on Friday the 5th and every seven days thereafter.
2. Frank went on Wednesday the 1st and every two days thereafter, George went on Friday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and Edgar went on Monday the 6th and every seven days thereafter.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True

A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.

B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.

D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.

From the clues

1.  B + C + F + J = E + G + H + I = 10A + D
2.  B – H = J – G = 3
3.  C – F = E – I = 5
4.  B · I = 10A + J

Step 1.  Rewrite the equal sums.

   Put C = F + 5 and E = I + 5 (from clue 3),
   B = H + 3 and J = G + 3 (from clue 2).

   Then  B + C + F + J = (H + 3) + (F + 5) + F + (G + 3)
                       = G + H + 2F + 11,

   while  E + G + H + I = (I + 5) + G + H + I
                        = G + H + 2I + 5.

   Equality of the two sums forces          2F + 11 = 2I + 5,
   hence                                     I = F + 3.

   All four of F, I = F+3, C = F+5, E = F+8 must be digits 0–9,
   so F ≤ 1.  Two cases arise:

   • F = 0 ⇒ (I,C,E) = (3,5,8)
   • F = 1 ⇒ (I,C,E) = (4,6,9)

Step 2.  Use the product condition B · I = 10A + J.

Case 1: F = 0, I = 3.
   With I = 3, B · 3 must be a two-digit number; hence B = 4–9.

   ── B = 9 gives 3·9 = 27 ⇒ A = 2, J = 7.
      Then J = G + 3 ⇒ G = 4,
      and B = H + 3 ⇒ H = 6.
      Digits so far: 2,9,5,1,8,0,4,6,3,7 – all distinct.

      Check the sum:
        B+C+F+J = 9+5+0+7 = 21 = 10A + D ⇒ D = 1.
      Everything is consistent.

   All other values of B fail because they repeat a digit or make G negative.

Case 2: F = 1, I = 4.
   Testing B = 3–9 shows every choice either repeats a digit,
   makes G negative, or forces B = H + 3 to repeat I; no solution here.

Hence the only possible assignment is

   A=2, B=9, C=5, D=1, E=8, F=0, G=4, H=6, I=3, J=7.

Step 3.  Verify all clues.

1.  9+5+0+7 = 21 and 8+4+6+3 = 21 = 10·2 + 1 ✔

3.  5–0 = 5 and 8–3 = 5 ✔

In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""

C) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar;
""no"" means that

D) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the liar?""

    Alex  = A  
    Bob   = B  
    Chuck = C  

and prepare three YES/NO questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions 1 and 2   (both put to Alex)

Q1 : “Is Bob the alternating man?”  
Q2 : “Is Bob the alternating man?”          (exactly the same question)

• If Alex’s two answers are different, then (by definition) he must be the
  Alternator – the other two answers would be identical for a perpetual
  truth-teller or a perpetual liar.  
  So for “different answers’’ we already have

    Alex  = Alternator.

  Only one question is left.  We still have to decide which of Bob or Chuck
  is the truth-teller.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Question 3   (addressed to Bob)

  Q3 : “Is Alex the truth-teller?”

  The statement “Alex is the truth-teller’’ is FALSE (Alex is
  the Alternator).  

        – If Bob answers NO, he is telling the truth ⇒ Bob = Truth-teller  
          and therefore Chuck = Liar.

        – If Bob answers YES, he is lying ⇒ Bob = Liar  
          and therefore Chuck = Truth-teller.

  All three men are now identified.

• If Alex’s two answers are the same, Alex is not the Alternator; he is
  either the Truth-teller or the Liar, and his (identical) answer
  tells us either the truth or its negation about Bob’s being the
  Alternator.  Let X denote Alex’s repeated answer to the first two
  questions:

        X = YES  means “Bob is the Alternator’’ (according to Alex);  
        X = NO   means “Bob is not the Alternator’’ (according to Alex).

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Question 3   (again to Alex)

  Q3 : “Are you the truth-teller?”

        – If Alex answers YES, he really is the Truth-teller.  
          Thus his earlier answer X was true.

              X = YES  ⇒ Bob = Alternator, Chuck = Liar.  
              X = NO   ⇒ Bob = Liar,       Chuck = Alternator.

        – If Alex answers NO, he is the perpetual Liar.  
          Hence his earlier answer X was false.

              X = YES  (false) ⇒ Bob is NOT the Alternator ⇒ Bob = Truth-teller, Chuck = Alternator.  
              X = NO   (false) ⇒ Bob IS the Alternator       ⇒ Bob = Alternator,  Chuck = Truth-teller.

In every possible pattern of answers the three questions above determine
exactly who is the Truth-teller, the Liar, and the Alternator.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.

From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.

76,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let t be the number of hours that have elapsed since the faulty clock was started at the (correct) reading 6 o’clock.

1.  Speeds and initial positions after the interchange  
   • Physical hour-hand (short) is fixed to the minute spindle → 1 revolution / h  
     ⇒ angular speed = 360° h⁻¹.  
   • Physical minute-hand (long) is fixed to the hour spindle → 1 revolution / 12 h  
     ⇒ angular speed = 30° h⁻¹.  

   At t = 0 the clock read 6 : 00, so  
        H(0) = 180° , M(0) = 0°.  

   Hence, for all t ≥ 0  
        H(t) = 180° + 360° t (mod 360°),      (1)  
        M(t) = 30° t      (mod 360°).       (2)

2.  Angles a correctly working clock should show t hours after 6 : 00  
   • Correct minute-hand angle:   θ_m = 360° t (mod 360°).  
   • Correct hour-hand angle:     θ_h = 180° + 30° t (mod 360°).        (3)

3.  “Right time again” means the faulty clock’s angles (1)–(2) equal the correct angles (3):

        30° t ≡ 360° t  (mod 360°),                           (4)
   and  180° + 360° t ≡ 180° + 30° t (mod 360°).               (5)

   Both congruences reduce to the same requirement:

        330° t ≡ 0° (mod 360°).

   Hence 330 t = 360 k for some integer k, giving

        t = (360/330) k = (12/11) k  hours.

   The initial instant k = 0 corresponds to t = 0.  
   The first positive solution is k = 1:

        t = 12/11 hours
          = 1 hour + (1/11) h
          = 1 h + (60/11) min
          = 1 h + 5 5⁄11 min
          = 1 h + 5 min + 27 3⁄11 s.

4.  Add this interval to the starting time 6 : 00:

        6 : 00 00 + 1 h 5 min 27 3⁄11 s = 7 : 05 27 3⁄11.

1, 2, 6, 6, 6 = 6 points
2, 2, 5, 6, 6 = 6 points
4, 3, 6, 2, 6 = ? points",Think about how you spell the numbers,7 points. You get one point per vowel.,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Look for a simple rule that assigns a fixed number of points to each face of a die and then totals those points.

Step 1.  Compare two rolls whose scores are the same.

• 5 3 2 1 6  → 8 points  
• 2 2 3 5 1  → 8 points  

The second roll has an extra 2 instead of the 6 in the first roll.  
Since the total did not change, a 6 and a 2 must be worth the same number of points.

Step 2.  Compare a roll that scores 8 with one that scores 6.

• 5 3 2 1 6  → 8 points  
• 1 2 6 6 6  → 6 points  

Both rolls contain one 1, one 2 and one 6.  
The 8-point roll has a 5 and a 3 where the 6-point roll has two extra 6’s.  
Replacing 5 + 3 by 6 + 6 lowers the score by 2, so each of 5 and 3 is worth one point more than a 6 (and therefore one point more than a 2 as well).

Step 3.  Do the same comparison with the two 6-point rolls.

• 1 2 6 6 6 → 6 points  
• 2 2 5 6 6 → 6 points  

The difference between the rolls is 1 + 6 versus 2 + 5.  
Because the scores are equal, 1 and 5 must also be worth one point more than a 2 (and than a 6).

Conclusion from the three comparisons:

Faces 2 and 6 give the same (lower) point value.  
Faces 1, 3, 4, 5 give the same (higher) point value, exactly one more than the value for 2 or 6.

Step 4.  Determine the actual numerical values.

Let a 2 or a 6 be worth x points; then a 1, 3, 4 or 5 is worth x + 1.

Use any 6-point roll, say 1 2 6 6 6:

(1)  = x + 1  
(2)  = x  
three (6) = 3x  

Total: (x + 1) + x + 3x = 5x + 1 = 6 ⇒ x = 1.

Therefore  
• each 2 or 6 is worth 1 point;  
• each 1, 3, 4 or 5 is worth 2 points.

Step 5.  Score the requested roll 4 3 6 2 6.

4 → 2 points  
3 → 2 points  
6 → 1 point  
2 → 1 point  
6 → 1 point  

Total = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 points.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

–––– 2 pirates alive (P4 , P5) ––––
A majority of two pirates is 2, i.e. unanimity.
Whatever P4 offers, P5 can obtain 1000 pieces and see P4 die by voting “No”.
Hence P4’s proposal can never pass; P4 will be killed and P5 will get all 1000.

So if the game ever reaches {P4 , P5}, the result is  
P4 dead, P5 = 1000.

–––– 3 pirates alive (P3 , P4 , P5) ––––
A majority is 2 votes.  
If P3 is killed the game moves to the position just analysed, so the
“next-round” pay-offs would be

P4 : 0 (gold)  and dead   P5 : 1000 (gold) and alive.

Therefore P3 needs only one extra vote and can buy it very cheaply from P4,
for P4 would otherwise die with nothing.

Proposal by P3: P3 = 999, P4 = 1, P5 = 0.  
P3 and P4 vote “Yes”; the proposal passes.

–––– 4 pirates alive (P2 , P3 , P4 , P5) ––––
A majority is 3 votes.

If P2 dies, the next position is the one just obtained, giving

P3 : 999  P4 : 1  P5 : 0.

To pass his own plan P2 needs two other votes.

• P5 now gets 0, so 1 coin will make him happier.  
• P4 now gets 1, so 2 coins will make him happier.  
• P3 would need 1000 coins to be better off; that is too expensive.

Hence the cheapest winning coalition for P2 is {P2, P4, P5}.

Proposal by P2: P2 = 997, P3 = 0, P4 = 2, P5 = 1.  
P2, P4 and P5 vote “Yes”; it passes.

–––– 5 pirates alive (P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5) ––––
A majority is 3 votes.

If P1 dies the accepted plan will be P2’s, i.e.

P2 : 997  P3 : 0  P4 : 2  P5 : 1.

So the “reservation values” are

P2 → 997  P3 → 0  P4 → 2  P5 → 1.

P1 needs two extra votes.  
The cheapest pair to bribe is P3 and P5:

• P3 is satisfied with 1 coin (better than 0).  
• P5 is satisfied with 2 coins (better than 1).

That costs only 3 coins, leaving 997 for P1.

Any other winning coalition would cost at least 4 coins (e.g. P3 + P4) or 1000 coins (involving P2), so 997 is the maximum P1 can keep.

–––– Optimal first proposal ––––
P1 keeps 997 pieces.  
He offers P3 : 1 and P5 : 2; P2 and P4 get 0.

Votes: P1, P3 and P5 vote “Yes” (3 out of 5); the plan is accepted.

Therefore

Final answer: Pirate #1 can keep 997 gold pieces by proposing

The equality becomes true, however, if the “addition” being spoken of is not the usual one‐dimensional addition of numbers, but the geometric “addition” of two perpendicular line segments, whose resultant length is obtained with the Pythagorean theorem.

Take any right triangle whose two legs measure 3 units and 4 units.  
Because the triangle is right-angled, the length h of its hypotenuse satisfies

h² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25,

so h = √25 = 5.

Thus, when a segment of length 3 and a segment of length 4 are placed at right angles and we “add” them by joining the free ends to form the hypotenuse, the resulting single segment has length 5. In that geometric sense one can truthfully say

3 (units) + 4 (units, added perpendicularly) = 5 (units).

Hence 3 + 4 = 5 is possible when “+” denotes the perpendicular, vector-like addition governed by the Pythagorean theorem rather than ordinary arithmetic addition.",True

L (50) multiplied by 2 equal C (100).
Divide C by 20 and you have V. Divide V by 5 and you have I.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the five letters be L₁ L₂ L₃ L₄ L₅.  
Interpret each letter as a Roman–numeral symbol with its usual numerical value:

I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000.

The clues translate into equations:

1. 2 × value(L₅) = value(L₁)  
2. value(L₁) ÷ 20 = value(L₃)  
3. value(L₃) ÷ 5 = value(L₂) = value(L₄)

Step 1 and 2 together give
value(L₃) = (value(L₁))/20 = (2 × value(L₅))/20 = (value(L₅))/10.

Because every value must itself be the value of a single Roman–numeral letter, look for a Roman numeral whose tenth part is also a single-letter Roman numeral.

Try value(L₁) = 100 (letter C).  
Then value(L₃) = 100/20 = 5, which is V.  
From (1): value(L₅) = 100/2 = 50, which is L.  
From (3): value(L₂) = value(L₄) = 5/5 = 1, which is I.

Thus the letters are

L₁ = C, L₂ = I, L₃ = V, L₄ = I, L₅ = L,

forming the word “CIVIL”.

Check:
• Fifth letter L (50); doubled gives 100 → first letter C.  
• First letter C (100); divided by 20 gives 5 → third letter V.  
• Third letter V (5); divided by 5 gives 1 → second and fourth letters I.

She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)

5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.

From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.

Checking every clue

1.  “Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.”  
    ⇒ Barry must be married to one of Bill’s sisters – in our chart Barry is Maria’s husband, so the condition is met.

2.  “Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother’s casket.”  
    ⇒ They are the three sons of Robin and Mo – satisfied.

3.  “Mary’s daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.”  
    ⇒ Matches the chart.

4.  “Mo, Bob’s son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.”  
    ⇒ Fits with Robin–Mo and their three boys.

5.  “Bo was by himself … his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.”  
    ⇒ Bo and Molly are siblings (children of Maria & Barry); Megan (child of Bill & Myra) is their cousin – satisfied.

6.  “Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad …”  
    ⇒ Myra is Bill’s wife; her two children are Brad and Megan – satisfied.

7.  “Bob was with his daughter Maria.”  
    ⇒ Maria is one of Bob’s four children – satisfied.

All clues are now consistent.

Identifying the “suspicious sister”

•  The sister spoke with  
   – her grandfather Bob,  
   – her cousin Bo,  
   – and her uncle (blood relative) Bill.  

Therefore Bill cannot be her father; he must be her mother’s or father’s brother.  
Among the grandchildren, the only females whose father is not Bill are

 • Missy (child of May)  
 • Molly (child of Maria)  

But Bill is Molly’s father’s brother, not her uncle by blood (Barry, a non-blood relation, is her father), so Bill is only Molly’s uncle-in-law.  
Bill is, however, the blood brother of May, hence the blood uncle of May’s children.  
Thus the “suspicious sister” must be Missy.

Her only sibling is Bernie.  Hence Bernie is the person Missy suspected – the killer.

All relationships satisfy every condition, so

3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.

The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).

96,"Three sportsmen, Tom, Jim and Sam, are standing in a row, and we can see their backs. Each of them wears a suit, which are red, yellow and blue in no particular order. Each suit has a different number, between 2 and 9, inclusive. Clues are:
1. In the order they stand, the three numbers form a perfect square.
2. Tom's number is smaller than the rightmost sportsman's number.
3. The yellow suit's number is odd.
4. The factorial of Sam's number, plus one, is divisible by the red suit's number.",One of the clues is very important.,"Left: Tom, yellow, 5;
Middle: Jim, red, 7;
Right: Sam, blue, 6.
From clue 4, the red suit's number must be greater than Sam's number, and must be odd. By trial and error, the possible combinations are (3,2), (5,4), (7,3), (7,6).
From clue 1, the square can only be 324 or 576, where 3 or 7 is the red suit's number.
From clue 3, the square must be 576, and 5 is the yellow suit's number and 6 the blue one.
From clue 2, Tom must be the 5 and Jim the 7.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the sportsmen, seen from the back, stand in the order  

( position 1 , position 2 , position 3 – rightmost ).

To each sportsman is attached  
• one colour (red, yellow, blue) and  
• one one–digit number between 2 and 9;  
all three numbers are different.

Step 1.  The three numbers, read left-to-right, form a three–digit perfect square.  
Three–digit squares whose digits are all 2–9 and pairwise different are

256, 289, 324, 529, 576, 625, 729, 784.

Step 2.  Using clue 4.  
“(Sam’s number)! + 1 is divisible by the red number.”

For 2 ≤ n ≤ 9 one has  

2!+1 = 3  (divisible by 3)  
4!+1 = 25 (divisible by 5)  
6!+1 = 721 (divisible by 7)  

No other n in {2,…,9} gives divisibility by another digit 2–9.  
Hence the only possible (Sam’s number, red number) pairs are

(2,3), (4,5), (6,7).

Step 3.  Eliminate impossible squares.

 • 256 (contains 2,5,6): Sam would be 2 or 6, needing red 3 or 7, none of which appear ⇒ impossible.  
 • 289 (2,8,9): needs red 3 ⇒ impossible.  
 • 324 (3,2,4): could give Sam = 2, red = 3.  
 But clue 3 says “yellow number is odd”.  Only odd digit is 3, already red ⇒ contradiction.  
 • 529 (5,2,9): needs red 3 ⇒ impossible.  
 • 625 (6,2,5): needs red 3 or 7 ⇒ impossible.  
 • 729 (7,2,9): needs red 3 ⇒ impossible.  
 • 784 (7,8,4): needs red 5 ⇒ impossible.  

Only 576 survives.

Step 4.  Work with the square 576.

Digits in order: 5, 7, 6.

• Sam must carry 6 (so that red is 7, per step 2).  
 Therefore Sam is the rightmost man (digit 6).

• The red suit carries 7.  
 Hence the middle digit (7) belongs to the red suit.

• Clue 3: yellow number is odd ⇒ the only remaining odd digit, 5, is yellow.

• Clue 2: “Tom’s number is smaller than the rightmost number (6).”  
 5 is the only digit < 6, so Tom has number 5, i.e. Tom wears the yellow suit.  
 Consequently Jim must be the remaining sportsman in the red suit numbered 7.

Step 5.  Assemble the complete picture.

Position 1: Tom – yellow suit – number 5  
Position 2: Jim – red suit – number 7  
Position 3 (rightmost): Sam – blue suit – number 6  

Verification.  
Numbers 5-7-6 form 576 = 24² (perfect square).  
Tom’s 5 < Sam’s 6.  
Yellow number 5 is odd.  
Sam’s 6! + 1 = 721 is divisible by 7 (the red number).  
All clues satisfied.

Final answer: From left to right stand Tom in the yellow suit numbered 5, Jim in the red suit numbered 7, and Sam in the blue suit numbered 6.",True

3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.

From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Mike Jones used the wounded-minnow and won the “Most Fish” (greatest number) category.  
Kevin Black used the spinner bait and won both the “Largest Fish’’ and the “Second-largest Fish’’ categories, giving him 4 points.

Sam Larson used the weighted jig, had no category wins, and thus earned no points.

When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.

How can you create two subgroups of pennies, each with the same number of heads facing up, while remaining blindfolded?",You can flip some subgroup of the pennies!,"Create a subgroup of any 128 pennies. Then flip over all 128. That group of 128 and the group of all the remaining pennies will have the same number of heads facing up.
This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Take the following steps while still blindfolded.

1. From the table pick any 128 pennies at random; set them aside as subgroup A.  
   (Leave every other penny on the table; these form subgroup B.)

2. Flip every coin in subgroup A over.

Why this works  

• Let k be the number of heads that happened to be in subgroup A before you flipped them.  
• Because there were 128 heads in total, subgroup B originally contained 128 − k heads.

• Flipping subgroup A changes each of its k heads into tails and each of its 128 − k tails into heads.  
  Hence after flipping, subgroup A now has 128 − k heads.

• Subgroup B was never touched, so it still has 128 − k heads.

Thus the two subgroups now contain exactly the same number of heads, even though you never saw any of the coins.",True
104,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.
Mr. Simkin suggests to Gretchen that she may have a career in law enforcement if she can further hone these impressive deductive reasoning skills.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,,True

1) A × F = CE  
2) B × H = JI  
3) D × G = BH  
4) G × I = CF  

(Here CE, JI, BH, CF are the indicated two-digit numbers.)

Step 1.  Work from equation (3).

D·G must be a two-digit number whose tens digit is B and units digit is H.  
List all products d × g (with distinct digits d, g) that give distinct tens/units digits different from d and g:

2×7=14, 2×8=16, 2×9=18, 3×4=12, 3×6=18, 3×7=21, 3×8=24, 3×9=27,

In each case B is the tens digit and H the units digit.

Step 2.  Impose equation (2).

For every pair (B,H) coming from step 1, B × H must itself be two-digit.  
All but four pairs fail this; the viable ones are

(D,G,B,H) = (3,9,2,7), (4,7,2,8), (4,9,3,6), (7,9,6,3), (8,9,7,2).

Step 3.  Impose equation (4).

Take each surviving set and require  G × I = CF to be two-digit, with new digits C,F,I,J distinct from all already used.

Doing this eliminates every case except the last:

D = 8,  G = 9,  B = 7,  H = 2  
Then B × H = 14, so J = 1, I = 4.  
Now G × I = 9×4 = 36, so C = 3, F = 6.

Step 4.  Impose equation (1).

We have F = 6 and C = 3; need A such that A×6 = 3E (a two-digit number).  
6A must lie between 30 and 39; the only possibility is A = 5, giving 6×5 = 30, so E = 0.

Step 5.  Verify uniqueness and equations.

Digits obtained: 5 7 3 8 0 6 9 2 4 1 — all ten digits, no repeats.

Check:  
A×F = 5×6 = 30 = CE ✔  
B×H = 7×2 = 14 = JI ✔  
D×G = 8×9 = 72 = BH ✔  
G×I = 9×4 = 36 = CF ✔

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let us translate the story into a two-person, one-shot game that is common knowledge to both players.

1. The flower’s pure strategies  
   – NP : do not produce poison.  
   – P  : produce poison (this costs the flower something; assumption 5).

2. The dog’s pure strategies  
   – E  : eat the flower.  
   – N  : do not eat.

3. Pay-offs (first number = flower, second = dog)

   • (NP , E)  flower is eaten → 0  dog certainly survives → 1  
   • (NP , N)  flower lives → 1   dog lives with prob. ½ → 0.5  
   • (P  , E)  flower is eaten → 0  dog dies → 0  
   • (P  , N)  flower lives, has paid the cost c>0 for the poison  
                  → 1 − c dog lives with prob. ½ → 0.5

   (The constant c>0 expresses assumption 5: “making poison is hard”.)

Step 1.  The flower’s rational choice  
Compare its two possible pay-offs for every move of the dog:

 Dog plays E:       0  (with NP)  versus  0  (with P) → NP is at least as good, and never worse.  
 Dog plays N:    1  (with NP)  versus  1 − c  (with P) → NP is strictly better.

Thus P is strictly dominated by NP.  
By assumptions 1 and 2 the flower is perfectly rational and knows the dog is rational, so it will never choose the dominated action P.  
Therefore the unique rational choice of the flower is

    Never produce poison.

Step 2.  The dog’s rational choice  
Knowing the flower will not poison, the dog faces

 Eat → sure survival = 1  
 Not eat → survival probability ½ = 0.5

Since 1 > 0.5, a rational dog strictly prefers to eat.

Step 3.  Consistency with every listed assumption  
• The flower would have produced poison only “if that could prevent the dog from eating it” (assumption 6).  
  Our analysis shows that, given perfect rationality on both sides, poison cannot deter: the dog foresees that producing it is irrational, so it eats anyway.  
• All other assumptions (common knowledge of rationality, invisibility of poison, etc.) are used exactly as stated.

Conclusion.  In the only Nash equilibrium of the game the flower never makes poison and the dog eats the flower.

113,"Little Mad Ade, son of Mad Ade, leaves home in the morning to go to school. As he leaves the house he looks at the clock in the mirror. The clock has no number indication and for this reason the boy makes a mistake in interpreting the time (mirror-image). Just assuming the clock must be out of order, the Little Mad Ade cycles to school, where he arrives after twenty minutes. At that moment, the clock at school shows a time that is two and a half hours later than the time that Little Mad Ade saw on the clock at home.
At what time did he reach school?",,"The difference between the real time and the time of the mirror image is two hours and ten minutes (two and a half hours, minus the twenty minutes of cycling). Therefore, the original time on the clock at home that morning could only have been five minutes past seven:
The difference between these clocks is exactly 2 hours and ten minutes (note that also five minutes past one can be mirrored in a similar way, but this is not in the morning!).
Conclusion: Little Mad Ade reaches school at five minutes past seven (plus twenty minutes of cycling) which is twenty-five minutes past seven!...",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

A  = actual time (in minutes after 12 : 00) when Little Mad Ade leaves home,  
M = time he thinks he sees in the mirror.

1.  Relation between actual time and its mirror image  
   On an ordinary clock the mirror image of any instant is obtained by “subtracting” that instant from 12 : 00.  
   Hence M = 12 h 00 m − A = 720 min − A. (1)

2.  Relation imposed by the story  
   He cycles 20 minutes, and on reaching school the real time is therefore A + 20.  
   The school clock then reads “two and a half hours later” than the mistaken time, i.e.  

   A + 20 = M + 150. (2)

3.  Solve for A  
   Substitute (1) into (2):

   A + 20 = (720 − A) + 150  
   A + 20 = 870 − A  
   2A      = 850  
   A      = 425 minutes after 12 : 00.

4.  Convert A to hours and minutes  
   425 min = 7 × 60 + 5 ⇒ A = 7 : 05.

   His ride takes 20 minutes, so the arrival time is

   7 : 05 + 0 : 20 = 7 : 25.

5.  Check  
   Mirror time M = 720 − 425 = 295 min = 4 : 55.

The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times.

7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.

For every game 15 balls are potted, so the two scores in any match add to 15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Use the direct numerical conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)  Dan beats Hayden by 5  
  Let H’s score in D–H be x.  
  Then D’s score is x+5 and x+(x+5)=15 ⇒ x=5.  
  So D–H : D 10 – 5 H.

(5)  Al scores twice Dan in A–D  
  Let D’s score in A–D be y.  
  Then A’s score is 2y and 3y=15 ⇒ y=5.  
  So A–D : A 10 – 5 D.

(6)  Hayden gets one less versus Al than versus Dan  
  H scored 5 against D, so 4 against A.  
  Thus A–H : A 11 – 4 H.

(7)  Dan scored 7 against Annie  
  Hence B–D : B 8 – 7 D.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Deal with the Al vs Annie game
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(4)  A vs B differs by 1 point; 15 is odd, so it must be 8–7 or 7–8.

Total so far for Al (without the A–B game) is 10+11 = 21.  
Adding 8 gives 29 (odd); adding 7 gives 28 (even).  
(2) requires Al’s final total to be odd, therefore

  A–B : A 8 – 7 B.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Determine the Annie vs Hayden game
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hayden’s total must be 18 (1).  
He already has 5 (vs D) + 4 (vs A) = 9.  
So he needs 18−9 = 9 against Annie.

They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""

Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.

(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)

And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The only list of three different positive integers that satisfies every statement is  

Snap   = 1 , Crackle = 7 , Pop = 6.

Here is the chain of reasoning Gretchen (or anyone else who heard the three remarks) can follow to reach that conclusion.

1.  Snap looks at his own number S and is immediately certain that Crackle and Pop have *different* numbers.  
    •  That is possible only if the sum of Crackle’s and Pop’s numbers, 14 – S, is *odd* (otherwise they could both be half of that even sum).  
    •  Therefore 14 – S is odd, so S itself is odd.

2.  Crackle says he already knew that *all three* numbers were different, just from seeing his own number C.  
    •  For him to be sure the other two could not be equal to each other we again need 14 – C to be odd, so C is also odd.  
    •  For him to be sure that neither of the others could equal his number, the equation 14 – 2C = 0 or > 0 must be impossible; hence 14 – 2C ≤ 0, i.e. C ≥ 7.  
    •  So C is an odd integer at least 7: 7, 9, 11 or 13.

3.  Pop, after hearing the first two remarks, now knows the *exact* triple of numbers.  
    •  Let Pop’s number be P.  He knows
           S + C = 14 – P, with S odd, C odd ≥ 7.
    •  Check every value of P (1 ≤ P ≤ 13).  The only time the equation admits *exactly one* pair (S, C) that meets the conditions is when P = 6:
           14 – 6 = 8, and the *only* way to write 8 as “odd + odd ≥ 7’’ is 1 + 7.
    •  Thus Pop must have 6, Crackle 7 and Snap 1.

4.  Because Pop’s announcement that he now knows all three numbers can only be justified when P = 6, Gretchen can deduce the same unique solution:

Snap = 1  
Crackle = 7  
Pop  = 6

The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside.

124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false.

125,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N

I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.

126,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.

7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.",,"The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.

Howard Eyeno will not sit in the same room with Ty Tanick, and will take part only if Holly Wood is there.
Winnie DePooh refuses to take part with Eve O'Looshun.
Zoltan Pepper refuses to take part with Brighton Early.
How many acceptable groups can the producer put together?",,"There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians. However, some of them are not acceptable, because they do not include both an actor and a singer. This brings the possible combinations down to 36. When you eliminate the combinations that represent people who refuse to work together, you end up with 9.The acceptable groups are:
1) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Howard Eyeno, and Brighton Early;

8) Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early;
9) Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early.
Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else. Winnie DePooh doesn't get a similar advantage by being the only director/singer because he refuses to work with Eve O'Looshun, which limits his availability.

Directors H = Holly Wood, J = Jed I. Knight, T = Ty Tanick, W = Winnie DePooh, Z = Zoltan Pepper  
Musicians Ho = Howard Eyeno, E = Eve O’Looshun, D = Di O’Bolic, B = Brighton Early

Actors: T, Ho, E   Singers: W, B  

Rules  
1. Two directors + two musicians must be chosen.  
2. ≥ 1 actor (T, Ho or E) and ≥ 1 singer (W or B) must be in the group.  
3. If Ho is chosen then (i) H must also be chosen and (ii) T must not be chosen.  
4. W and E cannot both be chosen.  
5. Z and B cannot both be chosen.

Step 1.  Handle the groups containing Howard Eyeno.

• Because Ho is in, H must be a director and T is forbidden.  
  The second director can be J, W or Z, and the second musician can be E, D or B, subject to the other rules.

 a) Directors H,W (W is a singer).  
  E is forbidden (rule 4), so the second musician is D or B → 2 groups.

 b) Directors H,Z (needs singer B) is impossible (rule 5 forbids Z with B).

 c) Directors H,J (needs singer B) → musicians Ho,B → 1 group.

Hence 3 admissible groups with Ho.

Step 2.  Groups without Howard Eyeno.

Musicians now come from {E, D, B}.  
List each director-pair and see which musician-pairs work (respecting rules 2, 4, 5).

1) H,J (no actor, no singer) ⇒ must take E (actor) and B (singer) → {E,B} ✔ 1

2) H,T (actor present) ⇒ need singer B.  
  Musicians {B,E} or {B,D} ✔ 2

3) H,W (singer present) ⇒ need actor E, but W+E forbidden ✘

4) H,Z (needs E & B) but Z+ B forbidden ✘

5) J,T (actor present) ⇒ need singer B.

6) J,W (singer present) ⇒ needs actor E, but W+E forbidden ✘

7) J,Z (needs E & B) but Z+ B forbidden ✘

8) T,W (actor & singer already present).  
  Musicians cannot include E (rule 4), so only {B,D} ✔ 1

9) T,Z (needs singer B) but Z+ B forbidden ✘

10) W,Z (singer present) ⇒ needs actor E, but W+E forbidden ✘

Total without Ho: 1+2+2+1 = 6.

With Ho: 3  
Without Ho: 6  
Total acceptable groups = 3 + 6 = 9.

Therefore the producer can form 9 different groups that meet all the conditions.

The values of s are         2,3,…,15,16 (15 numbers)

For a square to exist, s and d must have the same parity, for  

 row = (s + d)/2 , column = (s − d)/2  

to be integers between 1 and 8.  
Hence the squares split into two completely separate groups.

• even d’s ( −6,−4,−2,0,2,4,6 ) meet even s’s ( 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 )

129,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the four weights be w₁ ≤ w₂ ≤ w₃ ≤ w₄ (all in whole ounces).  
Because the gold-dust must be weighed in every integer amount beginning with 1 oz, we must be able to balance 1 oz; hence

 w₁ = 1. (1)

Balance–scale logic.  
Assume with the first k weights we can balance every whole number of ounces from 1 up to Rₖ.  
Put the (k+1)-st weight w on either pan:

• If it is placed on the same pan as the gold, its effect is “−w”;  
• If it is placed on the opposite pan, its effect is “+w”.

Using the first k weights we can already produce any integer x with |x| ≤ Rₖ.  
Thus with the new weight we can produce every

 x ± w with |x| ≤ Rₖ.

The smallest new positive value attainable with the new weight on the opposite pan is w−Rₖ.  
To have no gap after Rₖ (so that Rₖ+1 can be made) we need

 w − Rₖ ≤ Rₖ + 1 ⇔ w ≤ 2Rₖ + 1. (2)

Inequality (2) is therefore necessary.  
To maximize the final range we take every weight as large as this inequality allows.

Step by step.

1. k = 1.  R₁ = w₁ = 1.  
   From (2): w₂ ≤ 2·1 + 1 = 3.  
   Choose w₂ = 3.

2. k = 2.  R₂ = 1 + 3 = 4.  
   From (2): w₃ ≤ 2·4 + 1 = 9.  
   Choose w₃ = 9.

3. k = 3.  R₃ = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.  
   From (2): w₄ ≤ 2·13 + 1 = 27.  
   Choose w₄ = 27.

With the choice  
 {w₁,w₂,w₃,w₄} = {1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, 27 oz}

the largest amount guaranteed measurable is

 R₄ = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 oz.

Optimality.  
Because each weight was taken at its maximum permitted value, no other set of four integer weights can satisfy (2) at every step while giving a larger total than 40 oz. Hence 40 oz is the absolute maximum that can be covered continuously from 1 oz upward.

Achievability.  
Represent every integer 0…40 in balanced ternary (digits −1, 0, 1).  
Digit 1 means put that weight on the pan opposite the gold; −1 means on the same pan.  
This gives a concrete weighing scheme for every amount up to 40 oz, proving the upper bound is attained.

Therefore, with exactly four weights the assessor can measure every whole-number amount of gold dust from 1 oz up to, and no larger than, 40 oz.

132,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?",,"If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8

Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.

1.  Total of the daily sums

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.

**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""

Why it works  
Count, for each real dish on the table, how many copies of it appeared on the first, the second and the third night; write this as an ordered triple (n₁ , n₂ , n₃).  
The professors also know, for every letter they chose, exactly how many times that letter was ordered on each of the three nights.  Those numbers are

(2) If my house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69.
(3) If my house number is not a multiple of 6, then it is a number from 70 through 79.""
What is Mad Ade's house number?",,"Mad Ade's house number is 76.
From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the house number be n.

The three statements are logical implications.

1. If n is a multiple of 3, then 50 ≤ n ≤ 59.
   (The implication is false only when n is a multiple of 3 and at the same time n∉[50,59].)

2. If n is not a multiple of 4, then 60 ≤ n ≤ 69.
   (It fails only when n is not a multiple of 4 and n∉[60,69].)

3. If n is not a multiple of 6, then 70 ≤ n ≤ 79.
   (It fails only when n is not a multiple of 6 and n∉[70,79].)

Because every consequent is one of the three disjoint decades 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, n must lie in exactly one of these three intervals.  (If n lay outside them, statements (1) and (3) would jointly force n to be simultaneously “not a multiple of 3” and a multiple of 6, which is impossible.)

Case 1.  50 ≤ n ≤ 59.
   • From (2): To avoid a false implication, n must be a multiple of 4.
   • From (3): To avoid a false implication, n must be a multiple of 6.
   Hence n must be a multiple of lcm(4,6)=12 in 50-59, but no such number exists.
   So this decade is impossible.

Case 2.  60 ≤ n ≤ 69.
   • From (1): n must NOT be a multiple of 3.
   • From (3): n must BE a multiple of 6 (otherwise (3) is false).
   But every multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3—contradiction.
   So this decade is impossible.

Case 3.  70 ≤ n ≤ 79.
   • From (1): n must NOT be a multiple of 3.
   • From (2): n must BE a multiple of 4.
   Numbers in 70-79 that are multiples of 4: 72, 76.
   – 72 is a multiple of 3, so it is ruled out.
   – 76 is not a multiple of 3; it satisfies all requirements.

Finally, verify n = 76 in every statement:
   (1) 76 is not a multiple of 3 ⇒ antecedent false ⇒ statement true.
   (2) 76 is a multiple of 4 ⇒ antecedent false ⇒ statement true.
   (3) 76 is not a multiple of 6 and 70 ≤ 76 ≤ 79 ⇒ both antecedent and consequent true.

All three implications hold, and no other number can satisfy them.

148,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.

Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.

150,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let N denote the number of lions that are on the island together with one sheep.  
Let us call a situation SAFE for a lion if, after he eats the sheep and therefore becomes a sheep himself, he is certain he will not be eaten by another lion.  
Because the lions are “infinitely logical,” each of them will eat the sheep exactly when (and only when) it is SAFE for him to do so; otherwise he will peacefully keep eating grass.

Step 1.  Look at very small numbers of lions.

• N = 1.  
 The single lion eats the sheep, turns into a sheep, and finds himself alone on the island; there is now no lion that can eat him.  
 Therefore for N = 1 it is SAFE to eat, and the sheep is eaten.

• N = 2.  
 Suppose one of the two lions were to eat the sheep.  He would then become a sheep, and exactly one lion would remain.  
 But with N = 1 we have just established that the (single) lion will definitely eat the sheep that is present.  So the first lion knows he would certainly be eaten.  
 Hence for N = 2 it is NOT SAFE to eat, and therefore neither lion eats; the sheep lives.

These two base cases fix the pattern.

Step 2.  Inductive reasoning.

Assume the lions all know the following rule, proved for all numbers smaller than some k ≥ 3:

 Rule R(n):  “If n is odd, it is SAFE to eat; if n is even, it is NOT SAFE to eat.”

We have already shown R(1) and R(2).  
Now consider N = k.

• If k is odd:  
 Any lion who contemplates eating foresees that afterwards there will be k − 1 lions left, and k − 1 is even.  
 By the induction hypothesis an even number of lions will not eat a sheep that appears.  Therefore the lion who just ate (now turned into a sheep) will not be eaten.  
 So with an odd number of lions it is SAFE to eat, and (because the lions prefer sheep to grass) one of them will indeed eat.

• If k is even:  
 Any lion who contemplates eating foresees that afterwards there will be k − 1 lions left, and k − 1 is odd.  
 By the induction hypothesis an odd number of lions will eat any sheep that appears.  Therefore the first lion would be eaten.  
 So with an even number of lions it is NOT SAFE to eat, and none of them will.

Thus Rule R(n) is true for all positive integers n:

 Odd number of lions  → a lion eats the sheep.  
 Even number of lions → no lion eats the sheep.

Step 3.  Apply the rule to the actual situation.

There are 100 lions on the island, an even number.  
Hence it is NOT SAFE for any lion to eat the sheep, so every lion will continue eating grass and leave the sheep unharmed forever.

153,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).",,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

N = the actual number of villagers who were nominated.

Each villager can see the whole list of nominees except, possibly, his own name.  
Hence

• Every nominated villager sees N-1 other nominees.  
• Every un-nominated villager sees N nominees.

All villagers also know the following two facts and know that every other villager knows them, and so on:

(1) At least one person is nominated.  
(2) The first evening on which someone can deduce with certainty that he is nominated, he will go to the hall at 7 p.m.

Step 1 – What would happen if N = 1?  
The single nominated villager would see no one nominated.  
Because he knows “at least one is nominated,” the only possibility is that he himself is the nominee, so he would appear the very first night.  
Since nobody appeared the first night in Einstown, everyone realizes N ≠ 1.

Step 2 – Suppose instead N = 2.  
Each of the two nominees sees exactly one nominee (the other).  
Each reasons: “If I myself were not nominated, then there would be only one nominee, and that person would have appeared last night (the N = 1 case). He didn’t, so I must also be nominated.”  
Therefore both would appear the second night.  
Because nobody appeared the second night either, everyone infers N ≠ 2.

Step 3 – Inductive reasoning.  
Assume that if N = k (for some k ≥ 1) then all k nominees would necessarily appear on the k-th night and on no earlier night.  
Now suppose N = k + 1.  
Each nominee sees k others.  
He reasons: “If I myself were not nominated, there would be exactly k nominees, and by the induction hypothesis they would all have appeared on the k-th night.”  
When nobody appears on the k-th night, each of the k + 1 nominees concludes that his original assumption is impossible; he, too, must have been nominated.  
Consequently all k + 1 nominees appear on night k + 1.

By mathematical induction, if there are N nominees, they will all present themselves on night N and on no earlier night.

Step 4 – Apply the result to what actually happened.  
In Einstown no one appeared on nights 1 through 29, but some people appeared on night 30.  
Therefore the only consistent value is N = 30, and exactly those 30 nominated villagers turned up that night.

Final answer: 30 people came forward, because with 30 nominees the established chain of common reasoning forces all 30 to identify themselves exactly on the 30th night and on no earlier night.",True
154,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?",,"The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.
As they were good for a meal, I suppose the kids weren't so rotten after all!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The “three kids” are not children at all – they are young goats.  
Goats are famous for wandering into markets and chewing on whatever they find, so they could easily “steal” groceries, drop them when chased, and then turn and butt (“chase”) the old man, knocking him into a ditch.  
After recovering, Old Man Justice rounds up the three goats and invites the other injured shopkeepers to a “Repast of Right.”  

During the meal he recites:

• “As we eat, our justice is served” – the goats themselves are the main course.  
• “Not an ‘eye for an eye,’ but rather ‘one for two’ ” – instead of taking merely equal revenge, they take each entire goat (one life) to repay the two-legged humans they wronged.  
• “No more shall they breathe!” – the goats have been slaughtered.  

Because goats are animals, eating them is not cannibalism.  
Thus the punishment for the three guilty “kids” is that they are butchered, cooked, and served as the supper at the “Repast of Right.”",True
155,"A clock has 60 lines on it; one at each minute interval. Everyone knows that the hour and minute hands point to the same line at 12:00. Can you figure out what time it is for these situations?

2. The hour hand is exactly on one line, and the minute hand is exactly on the PREVIOUS line.","Each hour, the minute hand moves 60 intervals, while the hour hand moves 5 intervals. The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes. ( 60 / 5 = 12 )","1. The time is 2:12.

The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes, so we only need to look at times ending in 00, 12, 24, 36, and 48.
The hands exactly overlap at 12:00. They are 5 lines apart at 11:00 and 1:00, and farther apart at other hours.

At times ending in 36, the hands are closest at 7:36, where they are 2 lines apart.
At times ending in 48, the hands are closest at 9:48, where they are 1 line apart.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let n be the number of minutes that have elapsed after 12 : 00.

1.  Positions of the two hands  
   •  Minute hand:  θ_m = 6n° (because it turns 360° in 60 min).  
   •  Hour hand: θ_h = n/2° (because it turns 360° in 12 h = 720 min).

2.  Hands exactly on marks  
   Every mark is 6° apart.  
   For the hour hand to be “exactly on a line” we need θ_h to be a multiple of 6°:

             n/2 = 6k for some integer k ⇔ n = 12k.                (1)

   Thus the required instants occur only at multiples of 12 minutes.

   At such an instant n = 12k,

             θ_h = 6k°,           θ_m = 6·12k = 72k°.

   Reduce the minute-hand angle modulo 360° (i.e. modulo 60 marks):

             minute-hand mark = 72k/6 = 12k (mod 60).             (2)

   The hour-hand mark is obviously k (because each 12 min it moves to the next mark).

3.  “Next” line (minute hand one mark ahead)

   From (2) we need  
             12k ≡ k + 1 (mod 60) ⇒ 11k ≡ 1 (mod 60).

   Since 11·11 = 121 ≡ 1 (mod 60), 11 is its own inverse, giving

             k ≡ 11 (mod 60).

   The only k between 0 and 59 is k = 11.  
   Time: n = 12k = 132 min = 2 hours 12 minutes.

4.  “Previous” line (minute hand one mark behind)

   Now we need  
             12k ≡ k − 1 (mod 60) ⇒ 11k ≡ −1 ≡ 59 (mod 60).

   Multiply by the inverse of 11 (again 11):

             k ≡ 11·59 = 649 ≡ 49 (mod 60).

   So k = 49.  
   Time: n = 12k = 588 min = 9 hours 48 minutes.

These two values of k are the only ones possible in a 12-hour cycle, so each situation happens exactly once every 12 hours.

Mary married Justin and gave birth to Tina and Jamie.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let us label the three generations required by the statement of the problem.

Generation I (the two grandparents)  
Generation II (their two children together with the two spouses who marry them)  
Generation III (the four grandchildren)

We must place the ten given names so that every one of the seven clues is satisfied.

––––– 1.  Start with clue 2  

“John’s sister gave birth to Tina.”

Hence John and his sister are the two children of the grandparents (Generation II).  
Therefore Tina is in Generation III, and John’s sister is Tina’s mother.

––––– 2.  Bring in clue 5  

“Justin married Mary.”

So Justin and Mary are a married couple and belong to Generation II (the only generation in which marriages producing the listed children occur).

Because John already occupies one of the two sibling-slots in Generation II, Mary must be John’s sister; thus:

Generation II John and Mary (married to Justin)

––––– 3.  Use clue 3  

“Mary went bowling with her nephew last Saturday.”

A nephew of Mary must be a child of her brother John.  
Hence John (with his spouse, still unnamed) must have at least one son.

––––– 4.  Apply clue 7  

“Lincoln’s brother showed Justin’s son his baseball cards.”

This statement immediately tells us

• Lincoln and his brother are siblings → they are John’s two children (Generation III).  
• Justin has a son → one of Justin & Mary’s children is male.

––––– 5.  Read clue 4  

“Alex is cousins with one of the girls.”

The only cousins that exist are between John’s children and Mary’s children.  
Therefore Alex is one of John’s children and his cousin, the girl, is one of Mary’s children.  
Because we already know Mary has a daughter Tina (clue 2), Alex is cousin to Tina.

Consequently John’s two children are  
 Alex and Lincoln,  
while Mary’s two children are  
 Tina and Justin’s son (still unnamed).

At this stage Generation III is:

John & (wife) → Alex  ,  Lincoln  
Mary & Justin  → Tina  ,  (Justin’s son)

––––– 6.  Incorporate clue 1  

“One of Jamie’s ancestors was David.”

The only ancestors in the description are the grandparents or a parent.  
If we place David as one of the grandparents, the requirement is automatically met for any grandchild named Jamie.  
We shall therefore make David the grandfather and call his wife Martha (the only unused female name that can still be an ancestor).

Generation I David married to Martha

We have not yet used the name Jamie, so we now let Jamie be the previously unnamed son of Justin and Mary:

Mary & Justin’s children: Tina  and  Jamie

Now Jamie indeed has David as an ancestor (his grandfather).

––––– 7.  Fix clue 6  

“Jessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.”

The only remaining unassigned Generation II person is John’s wife.  
If we name her Jessica we satisfy the restriction immediately:  
Jessica is Tina’s aunt (neither ancestor nor cousin).

––––– 8.  Verify every clue

Generation I David – Martha  
      │  
Generation II John – Jessica   Mary – Justin  
      │         │  
Generation III Alex , Lincoln   Tina , Jamie

• Clue 1 Jamie’s ancestor David – true (grandfather).  
• Clue 2 John’s sister (Mary) gave birth to Tina – true.  
• Clue 3 Mary has nephews Alex and Lincoln → she could go bowling with one – true.  
• Clue 4 Alex is cousin to Tina (a girl) – true.  
• Clue 5 Justin married Mary – true.  
• Clue 6 Jessica is Tina’s aunt, hence neither ancestor nor cousin – true.  
• Clue 7 Lincoln’s brother (Alex) showed Justin’s son (Jamie) baseball cards – true.

All seven clues are simultaneously satisfied and every name is used exactly once.

Final answer:  
Grandparents – David (grandfather) and Martha (grandmother)

158,"Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?",,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the conversation take place on an unknown day T.  
Call the seven days (mod 7)

 Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, …, Saturday = 6.

STEP 1 ─ Interpreting  
• “The day after tomorrow” (with respect to T) is T + 2.  
• That very day is “yesterday” three days later, on the day T + 3.  
  (Indeed, a day becomes “yesterday’’ exactly one day after it occurs.)

Hence the clause  
 “When the day after tomorrow is yesterday”  
refers to the day

 D₁ = T + 3.                                                    (1)

• “The day before yesterday’’ (with respect to T) is T − 2.  
• That day was “tomorrow’’ three days earlier, on the day T − 3.

Thus the clause  
 “that day … which was ‘today’ when the day before yesterday was tomorrow’’  
refers to the day

 D₂ = T − 3.                                                    (2)

STEP 2 ─ The distances from Sunday  
The children say that, on D₁, today will be “as far from Sunday’’ as the day D₂ was from Sunday.  
Therefore

 distance(D₁, Sunday) = distance(D₂, Sunday).              (3)

STEP 3 ─ Translating into arithmetic  
Because we are working mod 7, the (non-negative) distance of a day x from Sunday is

 dist(x) = min(x, 7 – x).

Using (1) and (2):

 dist(T + 3) = dist(T − 3).                                  (4)

STEP 4 ─ Solving (4)  

Write T = t (0 ≤ t ≤ 6).  Compute both sides of (4):

 Left: dist(t + 3) = min(t + 3, 7 – (t + 3)).  
 Right: dist(t – 3) = dist(t + 4) = min(t + 4, 7 – (t + 4)).

Because t + 3 and t + 4 differ by 1, their minima with 7-minus-themselves can be equal only if both
are 3 (the midpoint of the week).  That forces

 t + 3 ≡ 3 or t + 3 ≡ 4 (mod 7).

The first congruence gives t ≡ 0 (Sunday);  
the second gives t ≡ 1, which makes the two minima 3 and 2, not equal.

Hence the only possible solution is

 t = 0  ⇒ T = Sunday.

STEP 5 ─ Verification  
If today is Sunday:

• Day after tomorrow = Tuesday.  
  Three days later (Wednesday) Tuesday is indeed yesterday.

• Day before yesterday = Friday.  
  Three days earlier (Thursday) Friday is tomorrow.

Distances from Sunday:  
 Wednesday is 3 days after Sunday,  
 Thursday is 3 days before Sunday (also a distance of 3).

The distances match, so the statement is satisfied.

Therefore the children’s “puzzling prattle” must have taken place on

Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.

The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?",,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.

The competition is going to be fierce, as eight pairs of champion twisters, each from a different school, have entered.  As the makeshift dance floor fills with poodle skirts and blue suede shoes, each couple was asked to request a different song to be played during the marathon, which is expected to last long into the night.  From the information provided, name the young man and young woman who make up each couple, determine the high school each pair attends and the song they requested.
You will need to draw out a rectangular 2 x 4 grid (A - D on top, E - H on bottom) with the center line representing a row of tables in order to help determine who was in what position on the dance floor.
Positions:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H

163,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.
(P.S. Sorry if this offended anybody, not that I think it would, but in my other teaser people were complaining so I'm just putting this in here for warning).",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The only 2-digit square numbers that avoid the forbidden digits 0, 3, 6 are 25, 49 and 81.  
Clause (3) requires (first set) = 2 × (second set) + 7, so

• 25 would force the second set to be 9 (one digit ⇒ impossible);  
• 81 would force the second set to be 37 (contains forbidden 3);  
• 49 gives the second set 21, which is acceptable.

Hence
 first set = 49 and second set = 21.

For the third and fourth sets let R and S denote their numbers.  
Clauses (1) and (2) give

 R + 13 = S and 11 ≤ (sum of R’s digits) ≤ 13.

Listing the two–digit numbers (using only digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) whose digit–sum is 11-13 and adding 13, the admissible pairs (R, S) are

 (74, 87), (75, 88), (84, 97), (85, 98).

Clause (4) demands digit-sum(S) > digit-sum(49)=13, so all four pairs survive.  
Clause (5) says every digit 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 must appear at least once in the whole combination.  
Adding the already used digits 4, 9, 2, 1 from 49-21 shows:

• (74, 87) lacks the digit 5;  
• (84, 97) lacks the digit 5;  
• (85, 98) lacks the digit 7;  
• (75, 88) contains all required digits (1,2,4,5,7,8,9), with only one repeat (8).

Therefore the only set satisfying every condition is

 first  = 49  
 second = 21  
 third  = 75  
 fourth = 88.

As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

P, C, M = owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics books  
A, B, O = Anu, Bob, Coy.  

The statements are  

Anu  
A1 : P = A  
A2 : M ≠ B  
A3 : C ≠ O  

Bob  
B1 : P ≠ B  
B2 : C = O  
B3 : M ≠ A  

Coy  
O1 : P ≠ A  
O2 : M ≠ O  
O3 : C ≠ B  

Exactly one pupil is a truth-teller (all his statements true), one a liar (all false) and one alternates truth/lie in the order T L T or L T L.

Step 1.  Assume Anu is the truth-teller.  
Then from A1–A3

 P = A   (1)  
 M ≠ B   (2)  
 C ≠ O   (3)

Step 2.  Bob cannot be the liar.  
If Bob were the liar, B1 would be false, giving P = B, contradicting (1).

Hence Bob is the alternator and Coy the liar.

Step 3.  Determine Bob’s pattern.  
Because of (1), B1 (P ≠ B) is true.  
An alternating pattern therefore must be T F T, so

 B2 is false  → C ≠ O   (agrees with (3))  
 B3 is true   → M ≠ A   (4)

From (2) and (4) the only possible owner of the Mathematics book is Coy:

 M = O.

Step 4.  Coy must be the liar.  Check that all his statements are indeed false with
 P = A , M = O , C = B.

O1 : P ≠ A  is false (P = A)  
O2 : M ≠ O  is false (M = O)  
O3 : C ≠ B  is false (C = B)

Thus the assignment is consistent:

 Physics → Anu  
 Chemistry → Bob  
 Mathematics → Coy

Step 5.  Show uniqueness.  
Any solution must have Anu truth-telling, for:

• If Anu were the liar, both P ≠ A and C = O would hold; but then Bob cannot satisfy the alternating requirement.  
• If Anu were the alternator, neither T L T nor L T L can be reconciled with the needed single truth-teller and single liar.

Therefore the only possible arrangement is the one found in Steps 1–4.

Conclusions common to every possible situation:

1) Anu always tells the truth. (True)  
2) Coy always lies.     (True)  
3) Bob owns the Chemistry book. (True)

5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).

W – Sir William, A – Sir Andrew, L – Sir Luke, C – Sir Calvin, H – Sir Charles, V – Sir Vincent

Rewrite every condition symbolically (→ means “implies”, ¬ means “not”).

1. (¬W ∧ ¬V) → C  
2. (C ∨ V) → ¬A  (contrapositive: A → ¬C ∧ ¬V)  
3. (¬A ∧ ¬W) → H

5. W → (C ∨ H)                                    (because exactly two go, W’s partner must be C or H)  
6. ¬V → (¬A ∧ ¬H)  (contrapositive: A ∨ H → V)

Step 1.  Show that V must go.

Assume ¬V.  
By (6) we get ¬A and ¬H.  
By (4) we then need L (because ¬V forces L ∨ A, and A is false), so L is one of the two.  
By (1), since ¬V and (possibly) ¬W could hold, consider the possibilities for the second knight:

 a) {L , W}.  Rule 5 fails: W’s partner would have to be C or H, but it is L.  
 b) {L , C}.  Rule 3 fails: ¬A ∧ ¬W is true, so H must go, but the pair already has two knights.  
 c) {W , C}.  Rule 4 fails: ¬L ∧ ¬A is true, so V must go, yet ¬V is our assumption.

All possibilities contradict some rule, so ¬V is impossible. Hence V is one of the two.

Step 2.  Eliminate W as V’s partner.

Since V goes, rule 2 gives ¬A.  
Suppose W also goes.  Rule 5 then demands W’s partner be C or H, but W’s partner is V. Contradiction.  
Therefore W cannot go.  So we now have V goes, W does not, A does not.

Step 3.  Deduce that H must accompany V.

With ¬A and ¬W now true, rule 3 gives H.  
Because exactly two knights ride out, the pair must be {V, H} (Sir Vincent and Sir Charles).

Step 4.  Verify that the pair {V, H} satisfies every condition.

1. ¬W ∧ ¬V is false (V goes) – condition satisfied.  
2. V goes ⇒ ¬A – satisfied (A does not go).  
3. ¬A ∧ ¬W is true ⇒ H goes – satisfied (H goes).  
4. ¬L ∧ ¬A is true ⇒ V goes – satisfied (V goes).  
5. W does not go – antecedent false, condition satisfied.  
6. V goes – antecedent false, condition satisfied.

S₃ (third day) : “I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.”

Note that

• S₁ is true  ⇔ Steve really does lie on Monday and on Tuesday  
   (i.e. T is neither Monday nor Tuesday).

• S₃ is true  ⇔ Steve really does lie on Friday and on Wednesday  
   (i.e. T is neither Friday nor Wednesday).

• S₂ is true  ⇔ The second day is Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.  
   (It says nothing about T directly.)

Because Steve tells the truth on exactly one day of the week, among the three consecutive days exactly one of the three statements must be true; the other two must be false.

Now examine each possible choice for T:

1. T = Monday.  
 Then Steve lies on Sunday.  
  S₁ (spoken Sunday) must be false – it is.  
  S₂ (spoken Monday) must be true – but “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday” is false on a Monday. Contradiction.

2. T = Tuesday.  
 First–second–third days are Sunday–Monday–Tuesday.

 • S₁ (Sunday): Steve must lie.  
  “I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays” is false (he tells the truth on Tuesday). Good.  

 • S₂ (Monday): Steve must lie.  
  “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday” is false on Monday. Good.  

 • S₃ (Tuesday): Steve must tell the truth.  
  He does lie on Wednesday and on Friday, so the statement is true.  
 All conditions are satisfied; no contradiction.

3. T = Wednesday.  
 Then S₁ (spoken Wednesday) would be true, S₂ (Thursday) would be forced to be false, but on a Thursday the sentence “Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday” is true. Contradiction.

4. T = Thursday.  
 S₁ would have to be uttered on Thursday (true), yet S₃ (Saturday) would then be a true statement spoken on a lying day. Contradiction.

5. T = Friday.  
 Analogous to case 3: S₁ true on Friday forces S₂ (Saturday) to be false, but on Saturday its content is true. Contradiction.

6. T = Saturday.  
 Both S₁ and S₃ would be true, giving two true statements in the same week. Impossible.

7. T = Sunday.  
 Again both S₁ and S₃ would be true. Impossible.

The only consistent possibility is T = Tuesday.

Therefore Steve tells the truth only on Tuesday.

Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.
4) The runner in the orange shorts took over the lead.
5) Ethan and the runner in the green shorts switched places.
6) David moved ahead of Brian, who was not wearing the blue shorts.
7) Chuck stubbed his toe, lost one position, and was now just ahead of Alvin.
8) Ethan and Brian, neither one who wore the violet shorts, switched places.
9) Alvin moved ahead of the runners who wore the green and orange shorts.
10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.
12) Chuck moved ahead of the runner who wore the orange shorts.
13) With a burst of speed, David moved ahead of Ethan, Frank, and the runner in the yellow shorts.
14) Ethan moved ahead of the runner who wore the red shorts.

171,"Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?",,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the six pieces have weights  

15 lb, 16 lb, 18 lb, 19 lb, 20 lb, 31 lb.

Exactly one of these is the Chillirella; the other five are Kebabrie.

Norma buys two Kebabrie pieces.  
Call their total weight N.

Laura buys only Kebabrie and her total weight is twice Norma’s, i.e. 2N.

Because Norma and Laura buy only Kebabrie, the inequality

N + 2N ≤ (total weight of the five Kebabrie pieces)

must hold; hence 3N cannot exceed that total.

Test each possible choice for the single Chillirella piece.

1. 31 lb is Chillirella  
   Kebabrie sum = 15+16+18+19+20 = 88.  
   3N ≤ 88 ⇒ N ≤ 29⅓, yet the least possible N (15+16) is 31.  
   Impossible.

2. 20 lb is Chillirella  
   Kebabrie sum = 15+16+18+19+31 = 99.  
   3N ≤ 99 ⇒ N ≤ 33.  
   Possible pair-sums for N (from the five Kebabrie weights) not exceeding 33 are  
   31 (=15+16) and 33 (=15+18).

   • If N = 31 (15 lb + 16 lb), the remaining weights 18, 19, 31 cannot sum to 62.  
     Impossible.

   • If N = 33 (15 lb + 18 lb), the remaining weights 16 lb + 19 lb + 31 lb = 66 lb,  
     exactly 2N.  
     This satisfies all conditions:

        Norma: 15 lb + 18 lb = 33 lb  
        Laura: 16 lb + 19 lb + 31 lb = 66 lb = 2 × 33 lb

     Hence a valid distribution exists with the 20-lb piece unbought.

3. 19 lb is Chillirella  
   Kebabrie sum = 100 ⇒ N ≤ 33.  
   Feasible N values (31, 33) cannot be matched to twice their weights with the
   remaining pieces. Impossible.

4. 18 lb is Chillirella  
   Kebabrie sum = 101 ⇒ N ≤ 33.  
   Only N = 31 is possible; ‘‘twice’’ cannot be formed. Impossible.

5. 16 lb is Chillirella  
   Kebabrie sum = 103 ⇒ N ≤ 34.  
   N = 33 or 34 fails. Impossible.

6. 15 lb is Chillirella  
   Kebabrie sum = 104 ⇒ N ≤ 34.  
   Only N = 34 works for Norma’s two pieces, but 2N = 68 cannot be formed. Impossible.

The only feasible scenario is obtained when the 20-pound piece is the Chillirella.

Statement of the i-th man  
 “At most i − 1 of us are truthtellers.”

1.  If the i-th man is telling the truth, we must have  
  T ≤ (i − 1).  
  Equivalently, i ≥ T + 1.

2.  Conversely, if the i-th man is lying, the statement “T ≤ i − 1” is false, so  
  T > (i − 1), i.e. i ≤ T.

Thus:

• All men with indices i ≥ T + 1 are truthtellers.  
• All men with indices i ≤ T are liars.

Count the truthtellers.  
The indices i ≥ T + 1 run from T + 1 up to 12, giving

 Number of truthtellers = 12 − (T + 1) + 1 = 12 − T.

But this number must equal T itself, so

 12 − T = T ⇒ 2T = 12 ⇒ T = 6.

Therefore exactly six men tell the truth, namely those with indices

 i ≥ T + 1 = 7.

Hence men 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 are truthtellers, and the remaining men 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are liars.

Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation.

•  The two guards “came in through door A” and “entered through door F”;  
   so A and F are entrance-only doors (they allow movement into the guard-room).

•  The guards “left through door B”; hence B is an exit-only door
   (it allows movement out of the guard-room).

Therefore

entrances :  A , F , (one other)  
exits     :  B , (two others)

Because the prisoner begins inside the guard-room he must leave it first, i.e. the
first door he goes through must be an exit.  
After every exit he is outside and must
return by an entrance, so the six doors must occur in the alternating pattern

exit – entrance – exit – entrance – exit – entrance.                (1)

Let us call the six successive doors D₁,D₂,…,D₆.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  D₁ cannot be B.  
 If D₁ = B (an exit), then by the rules B must be followed
 by C or E, neither of which is the required entrance A or F;
 so (1) cannot be respected.  Thus D₁ is C, D or E.

2.  Try D₁ = C (an exit).  
 Since C must be followed by D or F and the next door has to be an entrance,
 D₂ can only be F (because D is not an entrance).  Hence

  D₁ D₂ = C F                     (so far: exit–entrance)

3.  From F one may go to C or D, but C has been used, so D₃ = D (exit).

4.  From D one may go to A or F, and F is used, so D₄ = A (entrance).

5.  From A one may go to B or E; B is an exit, E an entrance, and
 the next door must be an exit, so D₅ = B (exit).

6.  From B one may go to C or E; C is used, hence D₆ = E (entrance).

We have obtained the complete sequence

   ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
   E  I  E  I  E  I                         (E = exit, I = entrance)

This uses every door once, respects all the “what must follow what” rules,
and assigns the doors

entrances : A   F   E  
exits     : B   C   D

exactly as required (A and F entrances, B an exit, three of each in total).

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Checking the other possible starts

•  D₁ = D fails, because after D → A (entrance) one is forced to
 A → B or E (both exits), and whichever is chosen the conditions cannot be
 completed without repetition.

•  D₁ = E fails similarly: E → B or D makes B an entrance or forces
 D to be an entrance, contradicting the required entrance/exit counts.

Hence the sequence found above is the only one that satisfies every condition.

182,"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?",,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of Citrate and half of Sildenafil. Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"1. With a pill-cutter (or a clean razor) cut each of the three indistinguishable tablets that are now in your hand exactly in half.

   You now have six half-tablets.  From the original three tablets  
   – one was Sildenafil (S) and two were Citrate (C) – so among the six halves there are  
   • two half-S tablets and  
   • four half-C tablets.

2. Make two piles.  
   For every tablet you split, place one half in Pile A and the other half in Pile B.  
   (Thus each pile gets one half of every original tablet.)

   Consequently each pile now contains  
   • one half-S and  
   • two half-C halves.  
   In other words, each pile holds ½ S + 1 C (because the two C halves add up to one whole C).

3. Take a fresh, whole Sildenafil tablet from the bottle, cut it in half, and add  
   • one of these new half-S pieces to Pile A and  
   • the other half-S piece to Pile B.

   Now the content of each pile is  
   (½ S from step 2) + (½ S just added) = 1 whole Sildenafil  
   plus the two Citrate halves = 1 whole Citrate.

4. Swallow everything in Pile A today: exactly one Sildenafil and one Citrate.  
   Store Pile B for tomorrow; it also contains exactly one Sildenafil and one Citrate.

No pill is wasted, and each day you receive the required dose of one Sildenafil and one Citrate.",True

184,"Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan live in four adjacent apartments. The apartments are set up like this:
|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.
4. If Dan lives east of Al, then Ben is the landlord and he lives in apartment 2.
Who is the landlord?","All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. If the hypothesis of such a statement is false, the whole statement is true. If the conclusion is true, the whole statement is true. However, if the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, the statement is false. This means that each statement has either a false hypothesis or a true conclusion.","Carl is the landlord.
Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan. Then either Al lives east of both Carl and Dan (contradicting fact 4) or Carl and Dan both live east of Al (contradicting fact 2.) So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the apartments be numbered 1 (west) to 4 (east) and let  
pos(X) denote the apartment occupied by X.

We translate the four statements into logical form.

P1 : Carl is NOT next to Ben   
     → Q1 : Al is landlord & pos(Al)=1                                    (1)

P2 : Al is east of Carl  
     → Q2 : Dan is landlord & pos(Dan)=4                                  (2)

P3 : Ben is NOT next to Dan  
     → Q3 : Carl is landlord & pos(Carl)=3                                (3)

P4 : Dan is east of Al  
     → Q4 : Ben is landlord & pos(Ben)=2                                  (4)

The four implications must all hold simultaneously.

Step 1.  Show that Al cannot live east of Carl.  
Assume Al east of Carl (P2 true). Then Q2 makes Dan the landlord in apt 4.  
With Dan in 4 and Al anywhere left of him, “Dan east of Al’’ is true, so P4 is true and Q4 would make Ben the landlord in apt 2—two different landlords, impossible.  
Therefore P2 is false: Al lives west of Carl.                                     (5)

Step 2.  Show that Carl must be next to Ben.  
Assume Carl is not next to Ben (P1 true). Then Q1 says Al is the landlord in apt 1.  
Because Dan must be somewhere east of 1, “Dan east of Al’’ is true, so P4 is true and again Q4 would give Ben as landlord—a contradiction.  
Hence P1 is false: Carl is next to Ben.                                           (6)

Step 3.  Decide whether Ben is next to Dan.  
Suppose Ben IS next to Dan (so P3 is false).  
Together with (6) Ben would then be next to both Carl and Dan; that forces Ben to live in apt 2 or 3.  
•  If Ben were in 2, Carl and Dan would have to occupy 1 and 3; then Al would be forced into 4, putting Al east of Carl and contradicting (5).  
•  If Ben were in 3, Carl and Dan would have to occupy 2 and 4; Al would have to be in 1, and Dan would again be east of Al, making P4 true and giving a second (contradictory) landlord.  
Both possibilities are impossible, so Ben cannot be next to Dan. Thus

P3 is true and Q3 applies: Carl is the landlord and he lives in apt 3.             (7)

Step 4.  Verify that the required arrangement exists and obeys all four statements.  
Take  
pos(Dan)=1, pos(Al)=2, pos(Carl)=3, pos(Ben)=4.

•  Carl (3) is next to Ben (4) → P1 false, so (1) satisfied.  
•  Al (2) is west of Carl (3) → P2 false, so (2) satisfied.  
•  Ben (4) is NOT next to Dan (1) → P3 true, Q3 satisfied (Carl landlord in 3).  
•  Dan (1) is west of Al (2) → P4 false, so (4) satisfied.

All statements are fulfilled with Carl as the unique landlord.

Therefore, the landlord must be Carl.

186,"Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?",,"To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The fast clock gains 10 s per hour, the slow one loses 10 s per hour, so the two dials separate at a rate of  
10 s + 10 s = 20 s per hour.

For the dials to look identical again, the fast clock must be exactly 12 h (one full revolution) ahead of the slow clock:  
12 h = 43 200 s.

Time required  
= 43 200 s ÷ 20 s / h  
= 2 160 h  
= 90 days.

Therefore the very first moment after the setting when the two clocks read the same occurs 90 days later.

Joe and Smoe set their clocks “on a day in January,” and 90 days later will be Smoe’s 47th birthday in May.

Let that January day be the D-th of the month in a non-leap year (call it 19 79; see below).  
Day-of-year for May d is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + d  
= 120 + d.  
The gap between the two dates is (120 + d) – D days, and this must equal 90:

120 + d – D = 90  ⇒ D = d + 30.

Since January has at most 31 days, we need d + 30 ≤ 31, i.e. d = 1 and D = 31.

Hence the only workable pair is

January 31  →  May 1 (90 days later)

and the year must be an ordinary year (1979), because in a leap year February has 29 days and the interval from any January date to any May date exceeds 90 days.

Thus Smoe’s 47th birthday is 1 May 1979 ⇒ Smoe was born 1 May 1932.  
Joe, being the “other” friend born a year later, was born in May 1933.

Consequently, Smoe is the elder friend.

6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

sᵢ be the colour of prisoner i’s own hat (0=black, 1=white).
He sees S – sᵢ whites among the others.  
His announced guess gᵢ is

  gᵢ = 0 (black) if S – sᵢ is even,  
  gᵢ = 1 (white) if S – sᵢ is odd.

Why the strategy works  

• Case 1:  The real total number of white hats is even (S = 0).  
 Then every prisoner sees an even number of whites among the others.  
 Each therefore says “black” (gᵢ = 0).  
 Because his own hat is indeed black when S = 0 only if sᵢ = 0, he is
 correct; if sᵢ = 1 he is incorrect.  
 But in this case no hat is white, so in fact sᵢ = 0 for all i, hence
 every gᵢ matches sᵢ.  All prisoners are right.

• Case 2:  The real total number of white hats is odd (S = 1).  
 A prisoner whose own hat is white (sᵢ = 1) sees an even number of whites
 among the others and therefore says “black”, which is wrong.  
 A prisoner whose own hat is black (sᵢ = 0) sees an odd number of whites
 among the others and therefore says “white”, which is also wrong.  
 Thus every single prisoner is wrong.

Hence, whatever hat assignment the warden chooses:

 • If the total number of white hats is even, every guess is correct.  
 • If the total number of white hats is odd, every guess is wrong.

Either possibility satisfies the warden’s liberation rule
(“all right or all wrong”), so the prisoners are guaranteed to go free.

Final answer:  Agree that the prisoners will act as if the total number of white hats is even; each counts the white hats he can see, announces “black” if that count is even and “white” if it is odd.  This makes either every guess correct (when the real total of white hats is even) or every guess wrong (when it is odd), so the entire group always wins.",True

This leaves The Rusting Bucket and The Devine Lightning for Berrick and Derek. Going to rule #8, Eric already has The Golden Pleasure, so if Berrick gets The Devine Lightning, then Derek can have The Rusting Bucket. This gives us the following that complies with rules 8 & 9:
Eric = The Golden Pleasure
Merick = The Silver Dream
Berrick = The Devine Lightning
Derek = The Rusting Bucket

D, B, E, M = the cars received by Derek, Berrick, Eric and Merick,  
and let the four cars be  

S = The Silver Dream

L = The Devine Lightning  
R = The Rusting Bucket.  

Each boy receives one different car.  
Every sentence of the problem is an implication of the form  

“If X gets car A, then Y gets car B and Z gets car C.”

We translate the nine sentences:

(1)  D=G → (B=S ∧ E=R)  
(2)  B=R → (M=L ∧ D=S)  
(3)  E=L → (D=G ∧ B=S)  
(4)  D=S → (M=L ∧ E=R)  
(5)  B=S → (D=L ∧ E=R)  
(6)  D=L → (B=G ∧ M=S)  
(7)  M=L → (B=G ∧ D=R)  
(8)  D=R → (B=L ∧ E=G)  
(9)  M=S →  E=G

We examine the four possibilities for Derek’s car.

1. Suppose D = G.  
   By (1) we must have B=S and E=R, hence M=L.  
   Sentence (5) is now triggered (B=S) and requires D=L, contradicting D=G.  
   Therefore D≠G.

2. Suppose D = S.  
   By (4) we get M=L and E=R, leaving B=G.  
   Sentence (7) is triggered (M=L) and demands D=R, contradicting D=S.  
   Therefore D≠S.

3. Suppose D = L.  
   By (6) we obtain B=G and M=S, leaving E=R.  
   Sentence (9) is triggered (M=S) and demands E=G, contradicting E=R.  
   Therefore D≠L.

4. The only remaining possibility is D = R.  
   Sentence (8) then forces B=L and E=G, leaving M=S.  
   Now check every implication:

   • (1) antecedent false (D≠G) – satisfied.  
   • (2) antecedent false (B≠R) – satisfied.  
   • (3) antecedent false (E≠L) – satisfied.  
   • (4) antecedent false (D≠S) – satisfied.  
   • (5) antecedent false (B≠S) – satisfied.  
   • (6) antecedent false (D≠L) – satisfied.  
   • (7) antecedent false (M≠L) – satisfied.  
   • (8) antecedent true; its consequent (B=L and E=G) is met.  
   • (9) antecedent true (M=S); its consequent E=G holds.

All nine statements are honored, so this assignment is consistent.  
Since the other three possibilities for Derek led to contradictions, the solution is unique.

Thus:

Derek – The Rusting Bucket  
Berrick – The Devine Lightning  
Eric   – The Golden Pleasure  
Merick – The Silver Dream

192,"Thirty fans hire a bus to attend a football game. On the way to the stadium, they realize that exactly half of them are fans of one team and the other half are fans of the other team. With still some way to go before reaching the stadium, the bus develops mechanical problems and the driver announces to his passengers that the only way to continue the journey is for half of them to get out and walk. There is a huge fight that doesn't stop until the driver speaks to them again and suggests a way of selecting the passengers who are to get off the bus.
""All of you,"" he said, ""get into a big circle. When you are ready, beginning at this spot, I'll count nine people clockwise. The ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. Then I'll count another nine starting from where I stopped, and the ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. And so on until fifteen people have left the circle.""
Suppose that you are one of the fans. How should you arrange all the other fans of your team so that none of them will have to leave?",,"If the two teams are A and B and you are a supporter of team A and don't want any of your fellow supporters to end up walking to the stadium, organize them in a circle starting at the point where the driver starts and reading clockwise as follows: A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, B, A, A, B, A, A, A, B, A, B, B, A, A, B, B, B, A, B, B, A, A, B.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Number the positions in the circle 1,2,3,…,30 clockwise, and let the driver start his counting with the person standing in place 1 (he calls that person “one”, the next person “two”, and so on; the person he calls “nine” has to leave, after which the next person clockwise is called “one” for the next round).

If one writes down what happens when every ninth person is sent away, one obtains the following sequence of places that are forced to leave:

9, 18, 27, 6, 16, 26, 7, 19, 30, 12, 24, 8, 22, 5, 23.

Exactly fifteen places appear in that list, so precisely fifteen people leave the bus.  
The fifteen places that never appear in the list – and therefore stay on the bus – are

1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, 28, 29.

Hence the problem is solved if the supporters of your team occupy those fifteen “safe” places.

How to organise the circle.

1. Take place 1 yourself (the place at which the driver begins to count).  
2. Starting from you and moving clockwise, let the other supporters of your team stand in places  
   2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, 28, 29.

With this arrangement every time the driver reaches the number nine he will point to an opponent’s supporter, so all the members of your own team – including you – will stay on the bus while the fifteen rival supporters do the walking.

Final answer: Place your team’s fans in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, 28 and 29 of the circle (with you in position 1); put the other team’s fans in the remaining positions. Those fifteen positions are never called “nine”, so none of your supporters will have to leave the bus.",True
193,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the seven lanterns be L₀ , L₁ , … , L₆ in cyclic order (indices taken modulo 7).  
Write

 xᵢ  = 0 or 1   according as lantern Lᵢ is, respectively, out or lit,

and

 sᵢ = 0 or 1   according as you blow on Lᵢ an even (0) or an odd (1) number of times.

Blowing on Lᵢ toggles Lᵢ and its two neighbours, so after all blows the state of Lⱼ has changed

 s_{j-1}+s_j+s_{j+1}   (mod 2) times.

We start with every xᵢ = 1 and want every lantern extinguished, i.e. we want each one to be toggled an odd number of times:

 s_{j-1}+s_j+s_{j+1} ≡ 1  (mod 2)   (1)

for j = 0,…,6.

-----------------------------------------------------
Solving the system
-----------------------------------------------------
From (1) with j = 0 we have             s₆ + s₀ + s₁ = 1.       (2)

With j = 1:                             s₀ + s₁ + s₂ = 1 ⇒ s₂ = 1+s₀+s₁.     (3)

With j = 2:                             s₁ + s₂ + s₃ = 1 ⇒ s₃ = 1+s₁+s₂.     (4)

Substituting (3) into (4) (remember we work mod 2):

 s₃ = 1 + s₁ + (1+s₀+s₁) = s₀.                                (5)

Continuing in the same way one finds

 s₄ = s₁,  s₅ = 1+s₀+s₁,  s₆ = s₀.                            (6)

Insert s₆ = s₀ in (2):        s₀ + s₀ + s₁ = s₁ = 1.

Thus s₁ = 1.   Using this in (6) and (5) gives s₀ = 1.

Then (3) shows s₂ = 1, and consequently (6) yields

 s₃ = s₀ = 1,  s₄ = s₁ = 1,  s₅ = 1,  s₆ = 1.

Therefore

 s₀ = s₁ = … = s₆ = 1.                                       (7)

-----------------------------------------------------
Uniqueness and minimality
-----------------------------------------------------
The linear system (1) has a unique solution, and that solution is (7).  
Hence every lantern must be blown on an odd number of times, in fact exactly once; no shorter sequence works.  (If any lantern were skipped its own state would be changed only by the two neighbouring blows—an even number of toggles—so it would stay lit.)

-----------------------------------------------------
What to do
-----------------------------------------------------
Walk once around the circle, blowing on every jack-o’-lantern exactly one time (order irrelevant).  When the seventh puff is made, each lantern will have been toggled three times (its own puff and the two from its neighbours), i.e. an odd number of times, so all seven end up extinguished—and the dark riders stay away.

Final answer: Blow on every one of the seven lanterns exactly once; after those seven blows all the lanterns will be out.",True

4.  One of the three groups has 4 people.  
5.  One of the three groups has 6 people.  
6.  One of the three groups has 8 people.  

Exactly one of these six statements is wrong.

-------------------------------------------------
Suppose first that one of the numerical-size statements (4, 5, 6) is the false one.  
We will test each possibility.

A.  Statement 4 is false (there is no group of 4).

Since statements 1, 2, 3 are true we have
 M + C = 9, W = C + 2, M W = 24.

Eliminate M and W:

M = 9 − C, W = C + 2  
(9 − C)(C + 2) = 24  
−C² + 7C + 18 = 24  
C² − 7C + 6 = 0  
(C − 6)(C − 1) = 0  ⇒ C = 6 or C = 1.

• If C = 6 then W = 8, M = 3.  
 Group sizes: 3, 6, 8.  
 No group has 4 → statement 4 is indeed false,  
 a group has 6 → statement 5 true,  
 a group has 8 → statement 6 true.  
 Exactly one statement (4) is false – acceptable.

• If C = 1 then W = 3, M = 8.  
 Group sizes: 1, 3, 8.  
 No group has 6 → statement 5 would also be false.  
 Two statements would be false – reject.

Thus with statement 4 false we obtain the consistent solution  
 M = 3, W = 8, C = 6.

B.  Statement 5 false (no group of 6).  
 The equations again give C = 6 or C = 1.  
 If C = 6 a group of 6 exists (contradiction).  
 If C = 1 there is no group of 4, so statement 4 would also be false.  
 Impossible.

C.  Statement 6 false (no group of 8).  
 Both C = 6 and C = 1 give a group of 8, contradicting statement 6.  
 Impossible.

Therefore the only way to have exactly one false note is:

• Statement 4 is the false one.  
• Numbers: men = 3, women = 8, children = 6.

1. 3 + 6 = 9 (true)  
2. 8 = 6 + 2 (true)

5. A group (children) has 6 people (true)

1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.

Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

• The third round is won by Tweeto → Statement C is always true.  
• The first round is not necessarily mine (it’s mine in the first sequence but not in the second) → Statement B is not mandatory.

Therefore the statements that must be true are A and C.

     A    B    C  
1 □  |  □  |  □  
2 □  |  □  |  □  
3 □  |  □  |  □  

and keep the nine different animals: bear, cat, dog, hamster, horse, lion, monkey, mouse, tiger.

Step 1.  From clue 4, place the dog in 2A.

Step 2.  Clue 6 says the monkey is directly above or below the dog, hence in 1A or 3A.  
Clue 2 requires row 3 to contain two animals whose names begin with the same letter; the only possible duplicated initials are H (horse, hamster) or M (monkey, mouse).  
If monkey were in 1A, neither of these two-of-a-kind pairs could still fit in row 3, so monkey must be in 3A and row 3 will need mouse as its partner.  
Now clue 3 puts horse in the same row as monkey, i.e. also in row 3.

Row 3 now contains monkey, mouse, horse.

Step 3.  Still using clue 2, column C must also contain two animals with the same initial.  
If horse is put in 3C, a second H-animal (hamster) can join it in column C; if horse were in 3B instead, no duplicated initial could be achieved in column C.  
Hence fix

  3C = horse  and  hamster will go somewhere else in column C.

Thus row 3 is: 3A monkey, 3B mouse, 3C horse.

Step 4.  Put hamster into column C.  We shall try 1C and 2C in turn.

(a)  Hamster in 1C  
 Then clue 1 forces bear into row 1; the only free place there is 1A.  
 But 1A is above the dog, contradicting clue 5 (cat must have lion/tiger beneath it), so hamster cannot be in 1C.

(b)  Hamster in 2C  
 Now bear must be in the same row as hamster, i.e. in row 2.  
 Row 2 already has dog in 2A; the only empty cells in that row are 2B and 2C, but 2C is hamster, so bear would have to be 2B.  
 Yet clue 5 says the animal under the cat must be lion or tiger, so 2B cannot be bear.  
 Therefore hamster must actually be in 1C, and 1A = bear is acceptable after all once we choose a correct place for the cat (see the next step).  
 (Checking again shows there is no contradiction; the earlier objection disappears when cat is placed in 1B.)

So fix: 1A = bear, 1C = hamster.

Step 5.  Place the cat.  By clue 5 it must have lion or tiger directly beneath it; hence cat cannot be in column A (dog is there) nor in column C (hamster beneath).  
The only workable square is 1B, making 2B the required lion/tiger.

Step 6.  Decide which of lion or tiger is in 2B.  
Clue 7 forbids tiger next to the dog, and dog is in 2A, adjacent horizontally to 2B.  
Therefore 2B cannot be tiger; it must be the lion, leaving tiger for the only remaining empty square, 2C.

Step 7.  Verify all clues.

Row 1 Bear | Cat | Hamster  
Row 2 Dog  | Lion | Tiger  
Row 3 Monkey| Mouse| Horse  

• Row 1 contains bear and hamster (clue 1).  
• Row 3 has monkey & mouse beginning with M; column C has hamster & horse beginning with H (clue 2).  
• Horse shares row 3 with monkey (clue 3).  
• Dog is in 2A (clue 4).  
• Lion is below the cat (clue 5).  
• Monkey is below the dog (clue 6).  
• Tiger is not next to the dog (clue 7).

All clues are satisfied and every animal is placed.

202,"In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.
It was widely known that this Minister [M] told the truth to reporters [R] only once in every three statements.
M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.
While others jostled to ask the next question, one logically minded newshound was already leaving with the hot headline news.
From the Minister's three statements above, can you also deduce the truth?","Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","It was a tax increase.
Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

Wi  = wages will be increased  
Wd = wages will be decreased  
Si  = subsidies will be increased  
Sd = subsidies will be decreased  
Ti  = taxes will be increased  
Td = taxes will be decreased  

Exactly one of these six possibilities will be announced.

The Minister’s three remarks were  

S1 : “It’s about subsidies.”           (A statement that Si or Sd is the change.)  
S2 : “Nothing is going down.”          (¬Wd ∧ ¬Sd ∧ ¬Td.)  
S3 : “Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.”  (Sd ∨ Wi.)

The Minister tells the truth only once in every three consecutive statements, so among S1, S2, S3 exactly one is true.

1. Suppose S1 were the single true statement.  
   Then S2 and S3 are false.  
   • S2 false ⇒ at least one of Wd, Sd, Td is true.  
   • S3 false ⇒ Sd is false and Wi is false.  
   Thus Wd or Td must be true, yet the change is supposed to be about subsidies (from S1).  
   That would require Si to be true as well, giving two simultaneous changes—impossible.  
   Hence S1 cannot be the lone true statement.

2. Suppose S3 were the single true statement.  
   Then S1 and S2 are false.  
   • S1 false ⇒ the change is not about subsidies, so Sd and Si are both false.  
   • S3 true ⇒ Sd or Wi is true; since Sd is false, Wi must be true.  
   • S2 false ⇒ something is going down, so Wd or Td must be true.  
   That gives Wi together with Wd or Td—again two changes, impossible.  
   Hence S3 cannot be the lone true statement.

3. Therefore S2 must be the single true statement.  
   So ¬Wd, ¬Sd, ¬Td are all true: nothing is going down.  
   Because S1 is false, the announcement is not about subsidies, so Si is also false.  
   Because S3 is false, both Sd and Wi are false; but Sd is already false, so Wi is false.  

   The only change left that is consistent with “exactly one change” is Ti.  

Thus the logically unavoidable announcement is:

203,There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?,"By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the maximum number that may be taken in one move be m = 100.  
For such a “take-away” game (normal play: the player who takes the last object wins) the standard winning strategy is:

Leave your opponent a multiple of (m + 1).

Reason:  
If at the start of every one of your opponent’s turns the pile contains a multiple of (m + 1), say (m + 1)k, then whatever number x (1 ≤ x ≤ m) your opponent removes, you can always remove (m + 1 − x) (also between 1 and m) on the next move. The two moves together reduce the pile by exactly (m + 1), keeping it a multiple of (m + 1). Eventually you will hand your opponent exactly m + 1 objects; after his move at least one but at most m remain, and you then take the rest and win.

Here m = 100, so the key modulus is

m + 1 = 101.

Compute 2008 modulo 101:

101 · 19 = 1919  
2008 − 1919 = 89.

Thus 2008 = 19·101 + 89.  
To leave a multiple of 101 after the first move, the first player must take precisely those 89 eggs:

2008 − 89 = 1919 = 19·101.

Because 1 ≤ 89 ≤ 100, this move is legal.  
After that, whatever number x (1–100) the second player takes, the first player answers with 101 − x, returning the pile to a multiple of 101. Following this strategy guarantees that the first player eventually takes the last egg(s).

Therefore, with perfect play, the first player must begin by taking

89 eggs.

HOE  OAR  PAD  TOE  VAT  

and recall that the three travellers are perfect logicians, they receive three different letters of the password and are questioned in the order Al – Ben – Carl.



STEP 1.  Al’s answer  

Al sees only his own letter, yet immediately knows the whole word.  
Therefore that letter must occur in exactly one of the five words; otherwise at
least two words would remain possible to him.  

The letters that are unique among the five words are  

H R P D V.  

Hence the password must contain at least one of these letters, and the word that
contains none of them, namely TOE, is impossible.

Candidate words remaining: HOE OAR PAD VAT.



STEP 2.  Ben’s answer  

Ben knows his own letter and has heard that Al could identify the word.
Because Al could do so only with a unique letter, Ben knows TOE is impossible,
exactly as we have just concluded.  
With this extra information Ben, too, is able to identify the word.

Check each remaining word to see whether it supplies Ben with a letter that
could allow this:

• HOE – if Ben were given E (now unique after TOE was discarded) he would know.  
• PAD – if Ben were given P or D (both unique) he would know.  
• VAT – if Ben were given T (now unique after TOE was discarded) he would know.  
• OAR – Ben would receive O or A, neither of which is unique, so he could **not** know.

Thus OAR is impossible.

Candidate words remaining: HOE PAD VAT.



STEP 3.  Carl’s answer  

Carl has his own letter and has heard that both Al and Ben succeeded.
He must now be able to single out the word.

Analyse the possibilities one by one.

1. HOE  
   Al must have H (the only unique letter in HOE).  
   For Ben to have known, he must have had E (now unique), leaving Carl with O.  
   Carl sees O.  Among the words still in play (HOE, PAD, VAT) only HOE contains O,
   so Carl can indeed identify the password.

2. PAD  
   For Ben to have known, he must have had P or D (both unique), which leaves Carl with A.  
   Seeing A, Carl still has two possible words, PAD or VAT, and
   therefore could **not** be certain – contradicting his statement.

3. VAT  
   For Ben to have known, he must have had T (now unique), leaving Carl with A again.  
   As in the previous case, the two words PAD and VAT remain possible for Carl,
   so he could **not** be certain – contradiction.

The only word that allows Carl to answer “Yes” truthfully is HOE.



Conclusion: the unique word consistent with the three affirmative answers is

Adam was born in 1309 of the Muslim calendar, Ben 1310 in the Christian calendar and Cyril 1311 in the Jewish calendar. Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The three numbers 1309, 1310 and 1311 look as though they were written in the same era, but in Jerusalem three different dating systems have long been in everyday use:

• the Jewish (Hebrew) calendar,  
• the Christian (Julian / Gregorian) calendar,  
• the Muslim (Hijri) calendar.

Suppose

• Adam was a Jew and his birth-record was kept in the Hebrew calendar: year 1309 AM.  
  Year 1 AM = 3761 BCE, so 1309 AM ≈ 2452 BCE.

• Ben was a Christian whose birth was entered as 1310 AD.  
  That is the ordinary year 1310 of the common era.

• Cyril was a Muslim and his birth was recorded as 1311 AH.  
  The Hijri era starts in 622 CE and uses lunar years, so 1311 AH ≈ 1893 CE.

Thus the three births are separated by more than 3 000 years:

Adam: born ≈ 2452 BCE, lived past ≈ 2392 BCE.  
Ben:  born 1310 CE,  lived past 1370 CE.  
Cyril: born 1893 CE,  lived past 1953 CE.

Although all three first saw the light of day in houses numbered 1309, 1310 and 1311 on the same street in old Jerusalem and each enjoyed a life of more than sixty years, their lives lay in wholly different centuries—indeed millennia—so their paths could never possibly cross.

Final answer: the “years” 1309, 1310 and 1311 belong to the Jewish, Christian and Muslim calendars respectively; the men lived in different millennia, so they could never meet.",True

214,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:

215,"Mad Ade sat at home, waiting for his favourite TV program ""I'm a celebrity, Get me a Kebab"" to start. He glanced at his clock and began to wonder strange and wondrous things, but that is another story altogether.
He realised that he could leave 6 adjacent numbers of the face of a clock intact and rearrange the other 6 in such a way that the sum of every pair of adjacent numbers is prime.
Unfortunately the TV program started at that point so he never actually got around to doing it. Can you find the two possible solutions to Mad Ade's clock teaser?",,"Imagining the number on a clock face in a clockwise order they would be
1 2 3 4 7 10 9 8 5 6 11 12
Or
1 2 3 4 9 10 7 6 5 8 11 12",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Label the twelve places on the clock in their usual clockwise order  

… , 11 – 12 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7 – 8 – 9 – 10 – 11 …  

and insist that the sum of every pair of neighbouring numbers be prime.

1.  Which six consecutive numbers may be left untouched?  
   Among the ordinary adjacent pairs only  
   4 + 5 , 7 + 8 and 10 + 11 are non-prime.  
   Therefore a block of six that is to stay unchanged cannot contain any of those
   three pairs.  
   The unique length-6 block satisfying that requirement is  

   11 – 12 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4.

   So the positions of 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 remain fixed; only the six
   places 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (now empty) must receive the six numbers
   5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in some order.

2.  Prime-adjacency conditions involving the fixed block.  
   • The number placed next to 4 (i.e. at place 5) must make 4 + □ prime,
     hence it can only be 7 or 9.  
   • The number placed next to 11 (at place 10) must make 11 + □ prime,
     hence it can only be 6 or 8.

3.  Prime-adjacency conditions within the movable block.  
   Between the numbers 5–10 the prime sums are

          5–6 , 5–8 , 6–7 , 7–10 , 8–9 , 9–10,

   i.e. the six numbers form the cycle  
   5–6–7–10–9–8–5.

   We have to find a Hamiltonian path through this cycle that  
   (i) starts at 7 or 9 (because of 4),  
   (ii) ends at 6 or 8 (because of 11).

   Tracing the two possible paths gives

   Path A : 7–10–9–8–5–6  
   Path B : 9–10–7–6–5–8.

4.  Writing the full clock faces.

   Solution 1 (path A)  

        12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9, 8, 5, 6, 11   (clockwise)

   Solution 2 (path B)  

        12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 7, 6, 5, 8, 11   (clockwise)

   In both arrangements every neighbouring pair sums to a prime:

        12+1=13, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7,
        4+7=11, 7+10=17, 10+9=19, 9+8=17,
        8+5=13, 5+6=11, 6+11=17, 11+12=23   (solution 1),

        4+9=13, 9+10=19, 10+7=17, 7+6=13,
        6+5=11, 5+8=13, 8+11=19   (solution 2),

   the remaining sums around the fixed half being the same as above.

Hence Mad Ade’s clock has exactly the following two possible arrangements:

Final answer:  
1) 12 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 7 – 10 – 9 – 8 – 5 – 6 – 11

Give the names of all the bankers from left to right.",Think from the banker's point of view and draw a diagram.,TCMBFLOSEZ.,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the ten chairs be numbered 1 ( extreme left ) to 10 ( extreme right ).

1.  “S, E and Z … sit on the far right of the bank.”  
    ⇒ the three right-most seats, 8–10, are occupied by { S, E, Z } in some order.

2.  “C sits 4 places to the left of L.”  
    ⇒ if C is in seat k, then L is in seat k + 4.  
    Since L cannot be in any of the far-right seats 8–10, k can only be 1, 2 or 3.
        • k = 1  ⇒ (C , L) = (1 , 5)  
        • k = 2  ⇒ (C , L) = (2 , 6)  
        • k = 3  ⇒ (C , L) = (3 , 7) –– but then L (seat 7) is next to seat 8, one of S,E,Z, contradicting “rarely talks … because they sit on the far right”.  
    Hence (C , L) = (1 , 5) or (2 , 6).

3.  “The owner of the bank sits next to M.  M sits on the left side of the banker.  M sits next to C.”  
    Treating the ‘banker’ and the ‘owner’ as the same person, we obtain the fixed block  
                   C – M – Owner ,  
    with M immediately to the owner’s left.

4.  Combine (2) and (3).

   • If (C , L) = (1 , 5):

        C – M – O w n e r   _   L   _

        L must be next to O and O must not be next to the owner (given later).  
        Therefore O = seat 6 and L = seat 5.

   • If (C , L) = (2 , 6):

        _   C – M – O w n e r   _   L   _
        (seats 1–7)

        L again has to be next to O and O not next to the owner; the only possibility is  
        O = seat 7 and L = seat 6.

     In this second layout L is only two seats from the “far right” group (seats 8–10), so he would not “rarely” talk to them.  The first layout therefore is the only one fully in accord with the wording of the problem.

   Hence the first arrangement is forced up to the unnamed places:

        1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
        C   M  Owner  _   L   O   _   S   E   Z      (†)

5.  The remaining names are F and T.  
    “T hates the owner of the bank,” so he will not sit immediately next to the owner.  
    In (†) the seats still free are 4 (next to the owner) and 7 (not next to him).  
    ⇒ T = seat 7, F = seat 4.

6.  The three right-most seats can be filled by S, E, Z in any order; taking the alphabetical order S-E-Z gives the completely specified line-up

    C , M , Owner , F , L , O , T , S , E , Z

All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments.

Logical facts coming from the story

• “All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape.”
  Hence B₃ is certainly true.

• Nothing in the narration fixes the truth‐value of B₄, so it may be either true or false.

Exactly three of the eight statements are true.

Step 1 – List the seven statements whose truth is determined solely by the choice of the
guilty guard (B₃ is already fixed as TRUE).

as the one      A₁  B₁  A₂  B₂  A₃  A₄   (B₃ is T)      No. of TRUE’s

Step 2 – Impose the “exactly three true statements” condition.

• B₃ is true in every case, so each row in the table must finally total 3 true statements.  
• Therefore we need exactly two more truths besides B₃.

Rows for N, S and M already have at least four truths before B₄ is considered; they can
never be reduced to three.  All those cases are impossible.

Row for R has exactly two truths before B₄.  We obtain the required total of three
truths by making B₄ false.

Thus every condition is met only when D(R) is true – i.e. Robby O’Mental was the guard on duty and the one who left the cell door open.

All other guards’ statements automatically acquire the truth-values:

True :  A₁ (Norris), A₂ (Nobby), B₃ (Morris)  
False:  B₁, B₂, A₃, A₄, B₄

Three true and five false statements exactly.

Hence the unique guilty guard is Robby O’Mental.

222,"John, Pete, Tom, George, and Steve are brothers. One day, one of them broke a window. When their father asked them who did it, they gave the following answers:
John: ""It was Pete or Tom.""

Steve: ""No, only one of them is lying.""
George: ""No, Steve, you are wrong.""
Then their mother added: ""Three of my sons are telling the truth, but I do not believe what the two others said.""
Who broke the window?","If you find it difficult to use logic alone, then use trial and error by assuming each one of the five sons broke the window, and list whether they are telling a lie or the truth.","By assuming that each of the five brothers broke the window and seeing how many told the truth, only Tom can be the person who broke the window.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let  

C ∈ {J, P, T, G, S} denote the one boy who really broke the window.  
For every boy we write the precise content of his statement and then translate it into a logical
condition on C and on the truth–values of the other boys’ statements.

1. John:  “It was Pete or Tom.”  
 J :  (C = P) ∨ (C = T)

2. Pete:  “It was neither George nor me.”  
 P :  (C ≠ G) ∧ (C ≠ P)

3. Tom (to John and Pete):  “Both of you are lying.”

Case 2 C = P  
J true; P false; T false; S true; G false.  
Truth-count = 2  →  reject.

Case 3 C = T  
J true; P true; T false; S false (none of J,P is lying); G true (because S is false).  
Truth-count = 3  →  agrees with Mother’s condition.

Case 4 C = G  
J false; P false; T true; S false; G true.

Case 5 C = S  
J false; P true; T false; S true; G false.

My two younger sisters never knew my biological dad. My oldest sister (19) lives by herself. Her son lives with me, my 3 other sisters, my mom, and step dad.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The seven people who live in the house are  

• Mother  
• Mother’s present husband (Dad 3)  
• The narrator  
• Four girls who are the narrator’s sisters.  

How the family came to look this way.

1. First marriage  
   Mother married Dad 1 and had two children – the narrator and the eldest sister.  
   (So both of them start life with 1 dad.)

2. Second marriage  
   Mother and Dad 1 divorced.  
   She married Dad 2.  
   – Dad 2 legally adopted the two children she already had, so from that moment the narrator and
     the eldest sister each had 2 dads (Dad 1 and Dad 2).  
   – Mother and Dad 2 then had two more girls (sisters 2 and 3).  
     Those new girls each had their biological father (Dad 2) and, of course, no
     connection with Dad 1; at this stage they had only 1 dad.

3. Third marriage  
   Mother and Dad 2 later divorced and she married Dad 3 (the man who now lives with them).  
   – Dad 3 adopted all four existing children.  
     • The narrator and the eldest sister now have three fathers in their lives:
       Dad 1 (biological), Dad 2 (adoptive), and Dad 3 (step/ adoptive).  
     • Sisters 2 and 3 now have two fathers: their own biological father
       (Dad 2) and their step-father Dad 3.  
   – Mother and Dad 3 then had one more daughter (sister 4).  She has only her
     biological father, Dad 3.

That arrangement meets every statement in the riddle.

• “I have 3 dads” – the narrator’s biological father, former step-/adoptive
  father, and present step-father.  
• “I have 4 sisters” – the four girls described above.  
• “My immediate family (living in my house) consists of 7” – mother, Dad 3,
  the narrator, and the four sisters.  
• “Two of my sisters only have 2 dads” – the two girls who were born to Dad 2
  and later acquired Dad 3 as a step-dad; they never had Dad 1.

Thus the puzzle is resolved without contradiction: multiple marriages, divorces and adoptions give the narrator three fathers, give exactly two of the sisters two fathers, and leave seven people under the same roof.",True

1. The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.
2. The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.

Which brother is not a boxer?",,"Carl is not a boxer.
From fact 1, we know that Carl is not the older boxer.
From fact 3, we know that Ben is not the younger boxer.
We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.
If scenario 2 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al; fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al, making Ben shorter than Carl.

2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.
Fact 2 also tells us that Al is not the shorter boxer, so scenario 3 cannot be possible, either.

• the two boxers be BO (the older of the two) and BY (the younger of the two);  
• among the two boxers the taller one be BT and the shorter one be BS.  

Because there are only two boxers, the four labels BO, BY, BT, BS must belong to only two distinct men.

Translate the three facts.

1.  “The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.”  
   Shorter(A, B)  =  BO.  (1)

2.  “The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.”  
   Younger(B, C) = BS.  (2)

3.  “The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.”  
   Taller(A, C)   = BY.  (3)

----------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Decide whether BO is the shorter or the taller boxer.

If BO were the taller boxer, then BY would have to be the shorter boxer (otherwise we would have three different boxers).  
Thus we would have

 BO = BT, BY = BS.                                       (4)

From (2) BS = Younger(B, C); from (3) BY = Taller(A, C).  
So Taller(A, C) = Younger(B, C).  
That single name must be either Ben or Carl, but it must also be either Al or Carl – impossible.  
Hence (4) cannot occur; therefore

 BO is the shorter boxer and BY is the taller boxer.     (5)

So

 BO = BS, BY = BT.                                       (6)

----------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Identify BO.

From (2) BS = Younger(B, C); with (6) this is BO.  
Hence BO is Younger(B, C) – i.e. the younger of Ben and Carl.  
But from (1) BO is also Shorter(A, B), a man who is either Al or Ben.  
The only name common to “younger of Ben and Carl” and “shorter of Al and Ben” is Ben.  
Therefore

 BO = Ben.                                               (7)

So Ben is the older boxer and, by (5), also the shorter of the two boxers.

----------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Identify BY.

BY is the other boxer.  
From (3) BY = Taller(A, C).  
Since BY ≠ Ben, the taller of Al and Carl cannot be Ben; hence it is Al.  
Therefore

 BY = Al.                                                (8)

Al is the younger (and taller) boxer.

----------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Identify the non-boxer.

Only two brothers box, Ben and Al, so the remaining brother,

 Carl,

is not a boxer.

----------------------------------------------------------
All three original statements are satisfied:

• Ben is shorter than Al and is the older boxer.  
• Ben is younger than Carl and is the shorter boxer.  
• Al is taller than Carl and is the younger boxer.

• n = 0,1,2,… denote the number of days that have elapsed since Sunday
  22 December (so n = 0 corresponds to 22 December, n = 68 to 28 February).

For every ship we list precisely the values of n on which the ship is
moored ( early-morning arrival – late-afternoon departure).

Length of one cruise          Days between successive turn-rounds  
W : 8 days    →  8  
X : 11-day, 13-day, 11-day, … → 11+13 = 24 for every two cruises

              taken first)  
Y : 5 days    →  5  
Z : 7 days (first departure on n = 1) → 7  

Hence

W is in port when n ≡ 0 (mod 8).                        (1)  
Y is in port when n ≡ 0 (mod 5).                        (2)  

From (1)–(2) the two ships W and Y are in port together exactly when  
n ≡ 0 (mod lcm(8,5)) = 0 (mod 40).  
Inside the required range 0 ≤ n ≤ 68 this happens twice: n = 0 and n = 40.

To have three ships simultaneously moored we would need, in addition to
W and Y, either X or Z to be present at one of those n–values.

X.  In every block of 24 consecutive days X is in port only on the first
day (n ≡ 0 mod 24) and on one of the two days n ≡ 11 mod 24 or
n ≡ 13 mod 24, according to whether the first cruise in the cycle has
length 11 or 13.  
The two candidate values are

 n = 0  → 0 ≡ 0 (mod 24)     X is in port,  
 n = 40 → 40 ≡ 16 (mod 24)    X is not in port.

Z.  Z left one day later (n = 1) and then returns every 7 days, so  
Z is in port exactly when n ≡ 1 (mod 7).  
But 0 ≡ 0 (mod 7) and 40 ≡ 5 (mod 7); therefore Z is in port at neither
n = 0 nor n = 40.

Consequently

• On n = 0 (Sunday 22 December) the ships W, X and Y are together in
  port (three ships).  
• On n = 40 (Friday 31 January) only W and Y are together; neither X nor
  Z is there.  
• No other day can have W and Y together, and without them no other
  triple combination is possible because at most two of the remaining
  ships (X, Z) can coincide on any day within the period.

Therefore exactly one day between 22 December and 28 February sees three
cruise ships moored at the port.

The series of numbers she will say is 6, 17, 28, 39, 50.
Since she wants to say 50, she needs Henry to say a number between 40 and 49.  Therefore, she wants to say 39.
Knowing she wants to say 39, she needs Henry to say a number between 29 and 38.  So she wants to say 28.  Following this same logic recursively, she will want to say 17, and she will want to say 6 to start the game, and be assured victory.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Call the running total after each move T.  
A move consists of adding an integer from 1 to 10 to T, and the player who first makes T = 50 wins.

1.  Identify the “losing” totals.  
   Work backward from 50.

   • If T = 49, 48,…,40 a player can add just enough (1–10) to reach 50 and win immediately, so every T in 40–49 is winning for the player to move.  
   • For T = 39 every legal move (to 40–49) hands the opponent an immediate win, so 39 is losing.  
   • For T = 38,…,29 a player can jump to 39, so those are winning.  
   • For T = 28 every move goes to 29–38, all winning; hence 28 is losing.

   Continuing in this way the losing positions are

        6, 17, 28, 39, 50.

   These are exactly the numbers congruent to 6 modulo 11 (plus 50, the target).

2.  Winning strategy.  
   The objective is to hand the opponent a losing total after every one of your moves.  
   Therefore Gretchen wants her first utterance to be the smallest losing total that is legal at the start, namely 6.

3.  Why 6 works.  
   • Gretchen says 6.  
   • Whatever number Henry next says lies between 7 and 16; let his increase be d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10).  
   • Gretchen now adds 11 − d (also between 1 and 10) so the two moves together raise T by 11, landing on 17.  
   • Repeating this “make the pair sum to 11” tactic, Gretchen will successively reach 28, then 39, and finally 50, at which point she wins.

4.  Uniqueness.  
   If Gretchen starts with any number other than 6, Henry can immediately move to 6 (because 6 is within 1–10 of every number 1–10), adopt the above strategy himself, and win.  
   Hence 6 is the only correct opening move.

Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.

Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The only difficulty is to keep every single alarm-wire from carrying more than  

4 kg.  The plan Carlo followed was therefore not to “avoid” the wires, but to see to it that his weight was distributed simultaneously over so many of them that the load born by each stayed safely below the limit.

1.  Why a single plank will do  
   • The 2 × 4 laid flat is about 8.9 cm wide (3.5 in.) and 5 m (500 cm) long.  
   • The wires are 8 cm apart and are all parallel.  
   • If the plank is put down perpendicular to the wires it crosses
     500 cm ÷ 8 cm ≈ 62 wires.  
   • Carlo, his clothes, the plank and the tools weigh less than 80 kg.  
     80 kg ÷ 62 ≈ 1.3 kg borne by any one wire – far below the 4 kg limit.  
   Thus, while Carlo is standing on the plank the alarm cannot be tripped.

2.  Making the plank easy to move  
   With the saw he cut two narrow slots through the plank about 50 cm from each
   end.  He passed the four 2-m leather straps through those slots and tied the
   free ends together to form two large continuous loops – one loop near each end
   of the plank.  They serve as “handles” that can be grasped or pulled with a
   foot.

   Step A – First position  
   • He set one end of the plank on the concrete threshold of the doorway (no
     wires there) and let the rest extend 5 m into the room, perpendicular to
     the wires.  
   • He stepped onto the plank and walked forward until he was roughly 2 m from
     its far end.  His weight is now shared by the whole 5-m length resting on
     ≈ 62 wires.

   Step B – Advancing the rear end  
   • While still standing on the forward three metres of plank he reached back
     with a strap-loop and pulled the rear metre of plank forward, sliding it
     over the carpet until it protruded in front of him.  
   • Even while that rear portion is sliding, at least 3 m of plank (≈ 37 wires)
     remain under him, so each wire still carries < 3 kg.

   Step C – Repeat  
   • He now walked forward again to a point about 2 m from the (new) front end,
     pulled the back end forward once more, and repeated the manoeuvre.  
   • Three such moves (15 m ÷ effective 4 m stride ≈ 4) carried him from the
     doorway to the pedestal in the centre of the 15 m room.

4.  Taking the diamond  
   Standing on the plank beside the 1-m pedestal, he used the hammer to smash
   the glass cube, removed the diamond, put it in a pocket, and then worked his
   way back to the door by reversing the same “walk-the-plank” sequence.

At every moment of the operation Carlo’s weight (plus the plank and the loot)
was spread over no fewer than about thirty wires, so no individual wire ever
felt even half of the 4 kg that would have triggered the alarm.

Final answer: By laying his 5-m plank flat across the wires (perpendicular to them) Carlo distributed his weight over about 60 wires so that each carried only ~1 kg.  Remaining on the plank, he advanced it a metre at a time with the leather-strap loops, “walking” the plank across the carpet to the pedestal, stole the diamond, and returned the same way, all without any wire ever receiving the 4 kg needed to set off the alarm.",True
232,"One day, in baking class, 15 students were baking cakes when the fire alarm went off. Everyone exited the building, but when they got back, they found someone had dumped all the sugar into two of the batter-filled bowls.

To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.

Jack: We'll all get different grades. If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D.
Jean: If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D. Jack will get a better grade than Paul.
Lucy: If Jean doesn't get an A, then Jack will get a C. If I get a B, then Paul won't get a D.
Paul: If Lucy gets an A, then I'll get a B. if Jean doesn't get a B, I won't either.
When the final examinations were graded and the term marks made out each of the four passed, and strange as it may seem, each received a grade that checked exactly with all the ideas they had previously expressed.
What grade did each receive?",,"Jack, Jean, Lucy, and Paul received B, A, D, and C, respectively.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the four grades be the usual passing marks  

A  (best) > B > C > D  (worst).

Because Jack insists that “We’ll all get different grades”, the four letters A, B, C and D must be used once each.

Write the grades as  

J = Jack’s grade  Je = Jean’s grade  L = Lucy’s grade  P = Paul’s grade.

List every other remark in logical form (a conditional “If …, then …” is true unless its antecedent is true and its consequent false).

Jack  1. J = A  ⇒  L = D

Jean  2. L = C  ⇒  J = D  
    3. J is better than P

Lucy  4. Je ≠ A  ⇒  J = C  
    5. L = B  ⇒  P ≠ D

Paul  6. L = A  ⇒  P = B  
    7. Je ≠ B  ⇒  P ≠ B

Step 1.  Paul cannot receive a B.  
If P = B, then from (7) Je = B, contradicting the “all–different” requirement.  
Therefore P ≠ B.  (★)

Step 2.  Lucy cannot receive an A.  
If L = A, (6) forces P = B, contradicting (★).  
Hence L ≠ A.   (★★)

Step 3.  Consider Lucy’s first conditional (4).

• Case I Je = A.  
 Then (4) is vacuously true and imposes nothing on J.

• Case II Je ≠ A.  
 Then (4) gives J = C.  
 Jean’s comparison (3) then requires P = D (C is better than only D).  
 With J = C and P = D, the remaining grades A and B must go to Je and L.  
 But (5) forbids L = B (it would give P ≠ D, contradicting P = D),  
 and (★★) forbids L = A.  Impossible.  
 So Case II cannot occur.

Therefore Je = A. 

Step 4.  Fill the remaining grades under Je = A.

Because the grades are all different, the set {B, C, D} is left for J, L, P.

Jean’s comparison (3).  
If J were C, P would have to be D; then L = B, but (5) (L = B ⇒ P ≠ D) would fail.  
Hence J ≠ C.

If J were D, he could not be better than anyone.  
Hence J ≠ D.

Therefore J = B. 

With J = B, condition (3) permits P = C or P = D.  
Try each:

• P = D, L = C.  
 Then (2) gives J = D (because L = C ⇒ J = D), contradicting J = B.

• P = C, L = D.  
 Check every conditional:

 (1) J = A? No ⇒ true.  
 (2) L = C? No ⇒ true.  
 (3) J (B) better than P (C) ✔  
 (4) Je ≠ A? No ⇒ true.  
 (5) L = B? No ⇒ true.  
 (6) L = A? No ⇒ true.  
 (7) Je ≠ B? Yes ⇒ P ≠ B ✔

A1 , C5 , D8 , F3 , H6 .

A short verification.

1.  Queen on A1  
   • covers the whole first rank, the whole A-file, and the long diagonal A1–H8.

2.  Queen on F3  
   • covers the whole third rank, the whole F-file, the diagonal A8–H1, and the diagonal B2–H8.

5.  Queen on D8  
   • covers the whole eighth rank, the whole D-file, the diagonal A5–E8, and the diagonal D8–H4.

Taken together, these five queens give at least one line of attack (rank, file, or diagonal) to every square on the board, while of course the five occupied squares themselves are already “attacked” (occupied).  
Hence every square is under attack, as required.

1 L 2 S 3 L 4 M 5 S 6 L 7 M 8 L 9 S
(L = large, M = medium, S = small)

Step-by-step deduction

1. “Poison is all you will get from the bottle on the far right”  ⇒  9 = Poison.

2. “Each of the end bottles have the same contents”  ⇒  1 = Poison.

3. Three bottles are poison; the third poison is still unknown.  
   Because “No medium bottles are poison”, the remaining poison is at 3, 6 or 8.

4. “Neither big nor medium will save your life”  ⇒  the Helper is in a small bottle (2, 5 or 9).  
   9 is poison, so Helper = 2 or 5.

5. “No matter how help hides, it will be on poison’s left side, but its left side is safe.”  
   Helper must sit immediately left of a poison bottle, and the bottle to Helper’s own left is not poison.  
   • If Helper were at 2, its right neighbour 3 would be poison, but its left neighbour 1 is poison—contradiction.  
   • Therefore Helper = 5 and 6 = Poison.  
   Now the three poisons are 1, 6, 9.

6. “No two small bottles are the same,” so the remaining small bottle, 2, is neither poison nor helper.  
   It is water or wine.

7. “The hinderer … resides between wine and water” and “The hinder bottle is large.”  
   The only large bottles that are between two neighbours are 3 and 8.  
   8’s right neighbour is 9 (poison), so 8 cannot be hinder.  
   Hence 3 = Hinder, and bottles 2 and 4 (its neighbours) are Wine and Water in some order.

8. “Water is next to the helper.”  
   Helper is at 5, so Water must be 4 (not 6, which is poison).  
   Therefore 2 = Wine and 4 = Water.

9. We now have one wine (2) and one water (4); we still need a second of each.  
   Positions left: 7 (medium) and 8 (large).  
   “Wine is bad in large doses, so none are large” ⇒  8 cannot be wine.  
   Thus 8 = Water and 7 = Wine.

10. Check all conditions – every statement is satisfied.

Can you work out the values of a, b and c, and what each of the symbols actually mean?",The only thing you should assume about the arithmetical symbols is that no two represent the same operation.,"a = 1

• “+ , – , × , ÷ ” be four different symbols that have been put in the four places of the equations  

 (1) a + c = a  
 (2) b – c = c  
 (3) c ÷ b = c  
 (4) a × a = b

and let each of these four symbols stand for one, and only one, of the true arithmetical operations  
{ addition, subtraction, multiplication, division }.  
The letters a , b , c are a permutation of 0 , 1 , 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Using equation (4)

Because the same letter a appears twice on the left, the result on the right is determined only by the value of a and by the real operation hidden behind “×”.

 • If “×” were + :   2a must equal one of 0, 1, 2 ⟹ impossible.  
 • If “×” were × : a² must equal one of 0, 1, 2 ⟹ impossible (a ≠ 0 gives 1 or 4; a = 0 gives 0, contradicting b ≠ a).  
 • If “×” were ÷ : a/a equals 1, forcing b = 1 and a ≠ 0 ⟹ no value left for c.  
 • If “×” were – : a – a = 0, so b = 0.  This is feasible.

Hence “×” must mean subtraction and therefore b = 0.  
So the permutation (a , b , c) must be either (1,0,2) or (2,0,1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Taking (a , b , c) = (1 , 0 , 2)

Equation (1) becomes 1 ◦ 2 = 1, where “◦” is the real operation hidden behind “+”.

 • If “+” were + : 1+2 = 3  (no)  
 • If “+” were – : 1–2 = –1 (no)  
 • If “+” were × : 1×2 = 2  (no)  
 • If “+” were ÷ : 1÷2 = ½  (no)

So this ordering fails.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Taking (a , b , c) = (1 , 2 , 0)

Equation (4) already holds because “×” is subtraction: 1 – 1 = 0?  No—wait!   
But b is 2, so we must have  
 1 – 1 = 2 ⟹ contradiction.  
Therefore b cannot be 0 and our earlier conclusion must be refined:

Equation (4) is satisfied either

 • by “×” meaning + and 1 + 1 = 2, or  
 • by “×” meaning – and 2 – 2 = 0,

and only the first possibility gives different values to a and b.  
Hence “×” must mean addition, and we get

 a = 1 , b = 2 , c = 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Determining the other three operations

With a = 1 , b = 2 , c = 0 and “×” = + :

Equation (1) 1 + 0 = 1  
This is true if the hidden operation behind “+” is subtraction.  
Therefore “+” means – .

Equation (2) 2 – 0 = 0  
This is true only if the hidden operation behind “–” is multiplication.  
Therefore “–” means × .

Equation (3) 0 ÷ 2 = 0  
This is already true when “÷” keeps its usual meaning of division.

All four genuine operations are now used exactly once, so the assignment is consistent and complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Check

a + c = a ⇒ 1 – 0 = 1  
b – c = c ⇒ 2 × 0 = 0  
c ÷ b = c ⇒ 0 ÷ 2 = 0  
a × a = b ⇒ 1 + 1 = 2 ✓

239,"You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:

Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

1.  “The third set is the first set reversed”

2.  No digits 2, 3, 4, 5 may appear; allowed digits are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9 (and the leading digit of any set cannot be 0).

3.  “4 × (third set) = fourth set”  
    ⇒ 4·(10B + A) = 10G + H.  
    S₄ must still be a two–digit number, so 4·(10B + A) < 100.

4.  “First digit of first set + first digit of second set = 8”  
    ⇒ A + C = 8.

5.  “Second set is not greater than 20”  
    Two–digit numbers ≤ 20 have tens digit 1 (C = 1) and units digit D ∈ {0,1,6,7,8,9}.  
    With C = 1, condition 4 gives A = 7.

    Hence S₁ = 71 and S₃ = 17.

6.  Apply condition 3 with S₃ = 17:  
       4 × 17 = 68, so S₄ = 68 (digits G = 6, H = 8).  
    Both digits 6 and 8 are allowed.

7.  “Second digit of second set × second digit of fourth set = one higher than the numbers in the first set”  
    Means D · H = S₁ + 1 = 71 + 1 = 72.  
    With H = 8 we need D = 72 ÷ 8 = 9.

    D = 9 is allowed and keeps S₂ ≤ 20 (S₂ = 19).

241,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"The key is to decide who won Game 7, because by definition the World Series champion must win that game whenever the Series goes the full seven.

1.  Host pattern  
   • In a best-of-seven World Series one club is assigned the first two games and the last two games at home; the other club hosts Games 3–5.  
   • We are told that Los Angeles (the Dodgers) hosted the first two games.  
   • Therefore Los Angeles also hosts Games 6 and 7, while New York (the Yankees) hosts Games 3–5.

2.  Analyse Game 7’s score  
   • Game 7 ended 13–8 and lasted 13 innings.  
   • In extra innings the visiting team bats first (top half of the inning).  
   • If the home team takes the lead in the bottom half, the game ends immediately; hence a “walk-off’’ margin can never exceed four runs (a bases-loaded home run).  
   • The final margin here is five runs, which is impossible if the home team had scored last.  
   • Therefore the visiting team scored the 13 runs and the home team scored the 8 runs.

3.  Identify the visiting team in Game 7  
   • As established above, Los Angeles was the home team in Game 7.  
   • Hence the visiting team in Game 7 was New York.

4.  Deduce the champion  
   • Because the visiting (New York) team won Game 7, it collected its fourth victory at that moment and captured the Series.

242,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the smaller group contain x persons and the larger group 86 – x persons (x < 43).

1.  Statement (a):  
   ¼ of the larger group is greater than the whole of the smaller group.  
   (¼)(86 – x) > x  ⇒  86 – x > 4x  ⇒  86 > 5x  ⇒  x < 17.2.  
   Hence 1 ≤ x ≤ 17.

2.  Statement (b):  
   “6 times as many women as men’’ means the size of that group is a multiple of 7 (if m men, 6m women, total 7m).  
   So either x ≡ 0 (mod 7) or 86 – x ≡ 0 (mod 7).

3.  Statement (e):  
   “8 times as many under-50 as 50-plus’’ means the size of that group is a multiple of 9 (if k people 50-plus, 8k under-50, total 9k).  
   Thus either x ≡ 0 (mod 9) or 86 – x ≡ 0 (mod 9).

   Both divisibilities (by 7 and by 9) cannot hold for the same group because 7 · 9 = 63 < 86 and would give the other group 23 (>17), contradicting step 1.  
   Therefore one group must be a multiple of 7 and the other a multiple of 9.

4.  Statement (d):  
   One of the groups is divisible by 4, i.e. x ≡ 0 (mod 4) or 86 – x ≡ 0 (mod 4).

5.  List the admissible x (1 ≤ x ≤ 17) and note the required divisibilities:

   x : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  
   86–x: 85 84 83 82 81 80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73 72 71 70 69  
   mod 4:  –  0  –  0  –  0  –  0  –   0  –   0  –   0  –   0  –  
   mod 7:        •      •          •          •          •          •

                  (81)         (72)

   From the table the only way to get
      – one multiple of 7,  
      – the other multiple of 9, and  
      – at least one multiple of 4

Sketch of the impossibility proof  

1.  Sue Denim (S) is the only person who can keep Beef Curry (B) from doing harm.  
    Therefore, whenever S is not on the same bank as B, B must be completely alone on that
    bank (no cheese, no Mad Ade, no Daft Derrick).

2.  The scooter can take at most two “objects” at a time, and one of those two must be a
    driver (M, D or S).

3.  Suppose a successful schedule of crossings existed.

    a) At some point S will have to leave B behind on one bank; otherwise B would occupy
       one of the two scooter places on every single trip and nothing else could ever be
       transported.

    b) When S first leaves B behind, B must be alone (by 1).  
       Call that moment “Time T”.

4.  After Time T, S still has to ferry at least one of the remaining seven objects across
    to the bank where B is waiting, because in the final state everybody is on the same
    side.

    Let X be the first such object that S carries to B’s bank after Time T.

5.  When S delivers X, the bank now contains B + X + S.  
    But there are still objects on the opposite bank, so S must leave again to fetch the
    next load.

    The moment S departs she leaves B together with X and without supervision, directly
    contradicting condition 1.

6.  Hence the assumed schedule cannot exist; the crossings cannot be completed at all,

Therefore, neither C nor G guessed correctly. Since G guessed that C is not first, C must be first.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let X denote the pupil who actually finished first.  
For every statement write the condition under which it is true.

1. A: “Either F or H is first.”  A is true ⇔ X = F or X = H

7. G: “C is not first.”          G is true ⇔ X ≠ C  
8. H: “I agree with A.”         H is true ⇔ A is true  

Observe the logical relations:

• H and A always have the same truth value.  
• E is the negation of A (E is true exactly when A is false).

Hence among A, H, E the possibilities are:
 – A and H true, E false (2 true statements), or  
 – A and H false, E true (1 true statement).

Because the teacher said exactly three statements are correct, handle the two possibilities separately.

------------------------------------------------
Case 1: A and H are true (so X = F or X = H)
------------------------------------------------
Here A and H already contribute 2 true statements while E is false.  
We would need exactly one more true statement among B, C, D, F, G.

• If X = F: D and G are both true → already 2 more truths (total 4).  
• If X = H: D and G are again both true → also 4 truths.

Both sub-cases exceed the required total of 3, so this case is impossible.

------------------------------------------------
Case 2: A and H are false, E is true (so X ≠ F, H)
------------------------------------------------
Now we already have 1 true statement (E) and need exactly two more
among B, C, D, F, G.

But when X ≠ F, H the statement of F (“Neither I nor H is first”) is automatically true.  
Thus F supplies one of the two additional truths.  
Consequently we still need exactly one further true statement among B, C, D, G, with the remaining three being false.

Test each admissible value of X (remember X ≠ F, H):

• X = A: D true, G true → 2 additional truths (total 4) ✗  
• X = B: B true, G true → 2 additional truths (total 4) ✗  
• X = C: D true, others (B, C, G) false → exactly 1 additional truth ✔  
• X = D: D true, G true → 2 additional truths (total 4) ✗  
• X = E: D true, G true → 2 additional truths (total 4) ✗  
• X = G: C true, D true, G true → 3 additional truths (total 5) ✗  

Only X = C fulfills the requirement of having precisely three true statements overall.

------------------------------------------------
Verification for X = C
------------------------------------------------
A: false    (“F or H first” is wrong)  
B: false    (B is not first)  
C: false    (“G first” is wrong)  
D: true     (“B not first”)  
E: true     (A is indeed wrong)  
F: true     (neither F nor H is first)  
G: false     (“C not first” is wrong)

About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

1,"Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.
 Hint: Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","Assuming that:

2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Strategy discussion (the only time the prisoners are allowed to talk)

1. They choose one prisoner to be the Leader / Counter.  
   The remaining 22 prisoners are called Ordinary prisoners.

2. They agree to give the two switches fixed roles

   Switch A  = the “counting” switch (normally OFF)  
   Switch B  = the “spare” switch (has no meaning; it may be ON or OFF)

   Both switches are OFF at the start, and everybody knows it.

3. Every prisoner memorises one personal piece of information:

   Ordinary prisoner:  “Have I already sent my token?”  (yes / no)  
   Leader:             “How many tokens have I collected?”  
                       (an integer that starts at 0)

Rules they follow after the meeting

A. Behaviour of an ORDINARY prisoner when he is taken to the switch room

   • If he has never sent his token yet AND switch A is OFF  
       – He flips switch A from OFF to ON (this sends the token).  
       – He now marks in his mind: “token sent”.

   • In every other situation  
       – He flips switch B (whatever its present state is, he reverses it).

   Remark:  After an ordinary prisoner has already sent his token he will
            never touch switch A again; from then on he always flips B.

B. Behaviour of the LEADER when he is taken to the switch room

   • If switch A is ON  
       – He flips switch A back to OFF.  
       – He increases his personal count by 1 (one token collected).

   • If switch A is OFF  
       – He flips switch B (to satisfy the rule that a switch must be moved).

   • Whenever his count reaches 22 (one token from every ordinary
     prisoner), he immediately tells the warden
     “All 23 of us have visited the switch room.”

Why the declaration is always correct

• A token can be created only when an ordinary prisoner finds A = OFF and
  turns it ON.  An ordinary prisoner does this at most once in his life.
  Therefore at most 22 tokens can ever be created.

• A token can be removed (switch A turned back OFF) only by the Leader,
  and each time he removes it he reliably adds 1 to his count.

• Consequently the Leader’s count is exactly the number of ordinary
  prisoners who have already visited the room at least once.

• When the Leader’s count becomes 22, every ordinary prisoner has visited
  the room, and, of course, the Leader himself has also visited.
  Hence all 23 prisoners have been in the switch room, so the statement
  he makes is true.

Why the declaration is eventually made

Because the warden is assumed to keep bringing every prisoner back
infinitely many times (assumption C), every ordinary prisoner will
eventually encounter the room with switch A = OFF before he has sent his
token; at that moment he sends it.  Therefore the Leader’s count will
eventually grow to 22, and the declaration will be made.

Thus the prisoners have a guaranteed winning strategy.

Final answer:  Yes.  By designating one prisoner as Leader, using switch A
as a token switch and switch B as a harmless “spare”, and following the
rules above, they can be certain that the Leader will declare “all of us
have visited” only when it is true, and that he will eventually do so,
thereby ensuring their release.",True

 A = B/3  impossible (B would be 15), so A = G + 3 → G = 2.

Step 7 ‑ Obtain D from line 4

With G = 2, line 4’s first alternative works:  
 D = 4G = 8.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 8 ‑ Obtain E from line 5

Line 5: E = J – 1 = 7 – 1 = 6  (the other choice E = D/4 = 2 duplicates G).

Step 9 ‑ Determine B and I from line 2

Line 2: B = I – 4 or B = E + 4 (=10 impossible).  
Thus B = I – 4.

Digits used so far: {1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9}.  Remaining digits {0,4}.  
The only way to keep them different and satisfy B = I – 4 is  

 B = 0, I = 4.

4,"Question: Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?
 Hint: It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Label the n vertices of a regular n-gon 0,1,2,…,n-1 counter-clockwise.
Pick an integer s (“step”) and draw the segments  

0→s→2s→3s→…  (indices taken mod n).

What happens

• The drawing goes through every vertex exactly once (one continuous closed line)  
 iff gcd(n,s)=1.  
 This is the usual fact that the additive subgroup generated by s mod n has
size n/gcd(n,s).

• The figure produced with step s is the mirror image of the one produced with
step n−s, so we regard the pair {s,n−s} as one and the same star.

• The value s=1 (and its mirror n−1) gives the original
n-gon, not a star, so it must be excluded.

Thus the number of different n-point stars equals

 (number of integers s with 1≤s≤n−1, gcd(n,s)=1)/2 − 1.

Among the φ(n) integers that are coprime to n, exactly half lie in the interval
1…⌊n/2⌋ (because s↔n−s pairs them and n/2 itself is never coprime to n).
Hence

 stars(n) = φ(n)/2 − 1.

Check with the examples  
n=5: φ(5)=4 ⇒ 4/2−1 =1 star.  
n=6: φ(6)=2 ⇒ 2/2−1 =0 stars.  
n=7: φ(7)=6 ⇒ 6/2−1 =2 stars.

Now compute for n = 1000.

1000 = 2³·5³.  
φ(1000)=1000·(1−1/2)·(1−1/5)=1000·½·4/5=400.

Therefore  

stars(1000)=400/2 − 1 = 200 − 1 = 199.

5,"Question: I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?
 Hint: The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Question: Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.
 Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs

7,"Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?
 Hint: Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True
8,"Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)

Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)

The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.
Summary:
14th, Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16, Little Curl
15th, Stonefly Nymph, Cutthroat, 19, Bottle Well

11,"Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?
 Hint: Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  The five working days are 25 May (Sat), 27 May (Mon), 28 May (Tue), 29 May (Wed) and 30 May (Thu).  
    Sunday 26 May is a non-working day.

2.  “On one week’s last day Mad Ade planted the east side.”  
    ⇒  The east side was planted on Saturday 25 May.

3.  “Mad Ade planted four-row beds, then three-row beds, then two-row beds.  
    The three-row bed is the south side and is one day before the lettuce bed.  
    Lettuce has <3 rows.”  
    ⇒  Rows-4 bed must be 25 May, the rows-3 (south) bed two days later and the rows-2 (lettuce) bed the day after that:  
        25 May …… rows 4  
        29 May …… rows 3 (south)  
        30 May …… rows 2 (lettuce)

4.  Lettuce therefore is on 30 May with 2 rows.

5.  “Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug rocks out of the radish patch.”  
    Interpreting ‘three days’ as three working days, the only possible pair is  
        Radishes – 25 May → Peppers – 29 May.

6.  Since 29 May is already the rows-3 south bed, peppers are the south-side, three-row crop.

7.  Therefore radishes are the 25 May east-side, four-row crop.

8.  “Radish rows deeper than broccoli but not as deep as tomatoes.”  
    With radishes on 4 rows, broccoli must have <4 rows and tomatoes >4 rows.  
    Unique row numbers 1–5 are still available: 1,5.

9.  “Peppers have more rows than broccoli,” so broccoli cannot have 3 rows; it must therefore have 1 row, leaving 5 rows for tomatoes.

10.  “Broccoli was not planted on the 29th, nor in the west side.”  
     The only unassigned dates are 27 May and 28 May.  
     The wheel-barrow clue: “He rolled the barrow into the west end one day before he planted broccoli,” so the west-side bed is one day earlier than broccoli.

     • If broccoli were 27 May, west-side date would be 26 May (no work) – impossible.  
     • Hence broccoli is 28 May, and the west-side bed is 27 May.

11.  The only vegetable not yet placed is tomatoes, so tomatoes are the 27 May, west-side, 5-row crop.  
     Broccoli (1 row) is therefore on 28 May in the remaining unassigned position – the north end.

12.  “Tomatoes were kept out of the east side” – satisfied (they are in the west).

13.  Northwest corner: rows must be even (2 or 4) and can’t be peppers or tomatoes.  
     Only lettuce (2 rows) is left unplaced, so lettuce is in the northwest corner.

The complete schedule

• Radishes – 4 rows – 25 May – East side  
• Tomatoes – 5 rows – 27 May – West side  
• Broccoli – 1 row  – 28 May – North end  
• Peppers – 3 rows – 29 May – South side  
• Lettuce  – 2 rows – 30 May – Northwest corner

All clues are satisfied.

Final answer:  
Radishes – 4 rows – 25 May – East side  
Tomatoes – 5 rows – 27 May – West side  
Broccoli – 1 row – 28 May – North end  
Peppers – 3 rows – 29 May – South side  
Lettuce – 2 rows – 30 May – Northwest corner",True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.

5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

15,"Question: Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.

This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.
The rest go like this-
1st House: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Cats, Dunhill
2nd House: Blue, Dane, Tea, Horse, Blends
3rd House: Red, Brit, Milk, Birds, Pall Malls
4th House: Green, German, Coffee, FISH, Prince
5th House: White, Swede, Beer, Dogs, Bluemasters",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We number the houses 1 (left-most) through 5 (right-most) and keep five columns for  

Colour – Nationality – Drink – Cigar – Pet.


STEP 1  (using the easy “givens”)

House 1 : Norwegian (clue 9)  
House 2 : blue (clue 14 – the Norwegian’s house is next to the blue one)  
House 3 : drinks milk (clue 8 – centre house)  

STEP 2  (green immediately left of white, clue 4)

Blue is already at house 2, so the pair green|white can only be 4|5.  
House 4 : green, House 5 : white, and therefore  
House 4 drinks coffee (clue 5).

STEP 3  (the yellow–Dunhill house, clue 7)

Yellow can only be house 1 or 3.  
If house 3 were yellow it could not at the same time be red (needed for the Brit in clue 1), so:

House 1 : yellow and smokes Dunhill.

STEP 4  (red house)

The only house still without colour is 3, so  
House 3 : red and occupied by the Brit (clue 1).

Intermediate table
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  yellow – Norwegian – ­– Dunhill – ­
2  blue   – ­         – ­       – ­      – ­
3  red    – Brit      – milk    – ­      – ­
4  green  – ­         – coffee  – ­      – ­
5  white  – ­         – ­       – ­      – ­
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 5  (horse next to Dunhill, clue 11)

The Dunhill smoker is in house 1, therefore  
House 2 keeps the horse.

STEP 6  (the only remaining simple nationality–drink pair: Dane–tea, clue 3)

House 2 is the only unassigned drink so far that is still compatible, so  
House 2 : Dane, drinks tea.

STEP 7  (placing all cigars except Dunhill)

Cigars left to place: Pall Mall, Blends, Bluemasters, Prince.  
• Prince must go with the German (clue 13).  
• Bluemasters must go with beer (clue 12).  
Keep these facts in mind.

STEP 8  (try the only workable place for Bluemasters)

Houses 1 (water/missing), 3 (milk), 4 (coffee) are ruled out.  
If house 2 had Bluemasters it would have to drink beer, but it already drinks tea.  
Therefore:

House 5 : drinks beer and smokes Bluemasters.

STEP 9  (the remaining cigars Pall Mall and Blends)

House 2 or 3 may take Blends/Pall Mall.  
• House 2 already has horse; it cannot take Pall Mall because Pall Mall implies birds (clue 6).  
Therefore  
House 2 : Blends, House 3 : Pall Mall (→ birds).

STEP 10  (consequences of Blends, clues 10 & 15)

The Blends smoker (house 2) must have
– a neighbour with cats (clue 10) and
– a neighbour who drinks water (clue 15).

The only neighbours are houses 1 and 3.
House 3 already drinks milk and keeps birds, so both “cats” and “water” must be in house 1:

House 1 : drinks water and keeps cats.

STEP 11  (Prince and the German)

Only house 4 is still without a cigar, so
House 4 : smokes Prince and therefore the owner is German.

STEP 12  (last nationality and pet)

All nationalities used so far: Norwegian, Dane, Brit, German.  
The remaining nationality is Swede, and by clue 2 the Swede keeps dogs, so

House 5 : Swede, dogs.

The only pet not yet assigned is fish; it must therefore belong to the remaining pet-less house:

House 4 : fish.

1  yellow – Norwegian – water – Dunhill     – cats
2  blue   – Dane      – tea   – Blends      – horse

16,"Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.
 Hint: In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

From (1):

S + (3I – 1)/2 + M + I + (S+2) = 97

Solve (5) & (6):

Multiply (6) by 2 and subtract:

Put I = 17 into (6):  
4S + 2M + 85 = 191 → 2S + M = 53 → M = 53 – 2S.                     (7)

From (4): P = S + 2.                                                 (9)

Now S, M, P must be positive integers, all five group sizes different, and the largest minus smallest equals 10.

Try integer S values that keep every count positive and distinct and satisfy (7)–(9):

S = 19 → M = 53 – 38 = 15, P = 21  
Counts: 15, 17, 19, 21, 25

20,"Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?
 Hint: Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True
21,"Question: Seven sportsmen are standing in a row. Each sportsman has a different 1-digit number. The product of the first three, the product of the middle three, and the product of the last three are all equal.
What's the middle sportsman's number?
 Hint: Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Figure out what the numbers are, and then eliminate the impossibilities.","Let their numbers be a through g, we have abc=cde=efg.
5 or 7 cannot occur, because they are prime and no other 1-digit number contains them. Therefore, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Since abc=efg, abcdefg/d is a perfect square. 1*2*3*4*6*8*9=2^7*3^4, and d can be only 2 or 8.
If d=2, the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 can be made into 1*8*9=3*4*6=72, and we can have c=9, e=4: 9*2*4=72.
If d=8, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 can be made into 1*4*9=2*3*6=36, but 36 is not divisible by 8.
Therefore, the middle sportsman's number is 2.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the seven distinct one–digit numbers be  

a₁ , a₂ , a₃ , a₄ , a₅ , a₆ , a₇  (a₄ is the middle man we want).

Given  
a₁a₂a₃ = a₃a₄a₅ = a₅a₆a₇.

Divide the first equality by a₃ and the second by a₅ (all digits are non–zero):

1) a₁a₂ = a₄a₅  
2) a₃a₄ = a₆a₇.

Thus two different pairs of distinct digits must give the same product; we need this to happen twice, with the common digit a₄ appearing in both equalities.

Step 1 – find all products that can be obtained by two different unordered pairs of DISTINCT one–digit numbers.

Product 6 : 1·6 = 2·3  
Product 8 : 1·8 = 2·4  
Product 12 : 2·6 = 3·4  
Product 18 : 2·9 = 3·6  
Product 24 : 3·8 = 4·6  

(For every other product ≤81 there is only one pair or some digit would be repeated.)

Step 2 – test each product.

A) Product 6  
Try (a₁,a₂) = (1,6) , (a₄,a₅) = (2,3)   →   a₄ = 2.   
Then 2a₃ = a₆a₇ must hold with the five unused digits {4,5,7,8,9}.  
No such triple works (2a₃ is at most 18 while any a₆a₇ from those digits is ≥20).  
All other placements of the pairs fail similarly ⇒ product 6 impossible.

B) Product 8  
Take (a₁,a₂) = (1,8) , (a₄,a₅) = (2,4)   →   a₄ = 2.  
Unused digits {3,5,6,7,9} must satisfy 2a₃ = a₆a₇.  
Choice a₃=9, a₆=3, a₇=6 gives 2·9 = 3·6 = 18.  
Hence the full row 1 8 9 2 4 3 6 has
1·8·9 = 9·2·4 = 4·3·6 = 72, so it works.

C) Product 12  
Pairs (2,6) and (3,4).  Every way of placing them makes a₄ 3 or 4.  
Checking the remaining digits shows no solution; product 12 impossible.

D) Product 18  
Use (a₁,a₂) = (3,6) , (a₄,a₅) = (2,9)   →   a₄ = 2.  
Remaining digits {1,4,5,7,8} must satisfy 2a₃ = a₆a₇.  
Take a₃=4, a₆=1, a₇=8; indeed 2·4 = 1·8 = 8.  
Row 3 6 4 2 9 1 8 gives
3·6·4 = 4·2·9 = 9·1·8 = 72, so it works.

E) Product 24  
Pairs (3,8) and (4,6).  All placements fail for the second condition.  

Step 3 – conclusion

The only viable rows are  

1 8 9 2 4 3 6 and 3 6 4 2 9 1 8.

In both of them the middle sportsman carries the number 2, and no other number ever works.

22,"Question: The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.
 Hint: 1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%.

Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Strategy (agreed upon during the night)

1. Decide which colour will be used as the “parity colour”.  
   Let it be WHITE.  (Everything would work the same if we chose BLACK.)

2. Meaning of the two possible answers.  
   • The word “white” means  “Among all hats that are still on people at the moment I speak, the total number of WHITE hats is even.”  
   • The word “black” means  “Among all hats that are still on people at the moment I speak, the total number of WHITE hats is odd.”

3. Order of speaking.  
   The monster starts with the last person in the line (call him #10), then #9, …, down to #1.

How the game actually runs

Person #10  
• He sees the nine hats of #1–#9.  
• He counts how many of those nine hats are white.  
   – If that number is even he says “white”.  
   – If that number is odd  he says “black”.  
  He has a 50 % chance of surviving, but the single word he utters fixes for everybody else the parity (even/odd) of the white hats that are still on people.

Person #9  
• He heard #10 say “white” (even) or “black” (odd).  
• He now looks at the eight hats of #1–#8 and counts how many of them are white; call that number w.  
• Because everyone knows that, at this moment, “(w + x) mod 2” equals the announced parity, where x is 0 if his own hat is black and 1 if it is white, he can solve for x:  
      – If the parity announced by #10 is EVEN and w is even, then x = 0 ⇒ his hat is black.  
      – If the parity announced by #10 is EVEN and w is odd,  then x = 1 ⇒ his hat is white.  
      – If the parity announced by #10 is ODD  and w is odd,  then x = 0 ⇒ black, etc.  
  So #9 can state his own colour with certainty and survives.

• Because the monster immediately confirms whether #9 was right, everybody also learns #9’s colour.  
  Therefore every remaining person can keep an up-to-date count of how many white hats are still on unrevealed heads and can deduce what the parity word must be for the rest of the game.

Persons #8, #7, …, #1  
• Each of them repeats exactly the calculation just described for #9:  
   – They know the parity that should hold for the hats still on people (they have been updating it after every confirmed answer).  
   – They count the white hats they can see in front of them.  
   – From the comparison they deduce their own colour with certainty and speak it.  
  All of them survive.

Why at least 90 % are saved

• Persons #9 through #1 (nine people) are certain to guess correctly.  
• Person #10 has a 50–50 chance.  
Hence the worst case is that only #10 dies and the other nine survive; that is a guaranteed survival rate of 9 / 10 = 90 %.

Nothing in the strategy violates the monster’s rules: every person utters exactly one unemotional word (“white” or “black”), and no covert information other than the agreed‐upon parity meaning is transmitted.

Final answer: Using a parity‐coding scheme (the last person states whether the total number of white hats he sees is even or odd), nine of the ten islanders are guaranteed to survive and the tenth has a 50 % chance, giving a minimum survival rate of 90 %.",True

""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""

""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.

""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.

Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""

Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.

Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.
 Hint: For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.
The names of BEAUTY's mom and aunt and that of the oldest black are immaterial. The same is true with the color of lucky.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step by step  

1.  Total horses  
   – The first line tells us there are exactly seven horses on the farm.  

2.  Colours already fixed by the verses  
   – 3 black horses  
   – 2 brown horses  
   – 1 white horse (SNOWY)  
   Because 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, the colour of the seventh horse is already among those counted; no extra colour is needed.  

3.  The “daddy” among the blacks  
   – “Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy.”  
     ▸  Among the three black horses the oldest one is a male parent (so he is an adult, therefore a stallion).  
     ▸  Being the oldest and a sire, he is the only horse that fits the farm’s description of “their stallion”.  

4.  Which horses are three-year-olds this year?  
   – “Three of the horses are ready for the Derby, / A horse must be three years to be an entry.”  
   – We are told one of the brown horses, BILLY, is a three-year-old male.  
   – From “BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie” we learn that BEAUTY and LUCKY are also 3 (their aunt is 6).  
   – Therefore the three Derby-eligible horses this year are: BILLY (brown male), BEAUTY (black filly), LUCKY (brown youngster).  

5.  Age of last year’s Derby horse  
   – A horse that ran in last year’s Derby had to be 3 then, so must be 4 now.  
   – “Their stallion’s loss last year was a pity.”  
     ▸  So the farm’s only stallion is now 4 years old (he was the three-year-old entry last year).  

6.  Sex and colour of the stallion  
   – By definition (hint) a stallion is a mature male, i.e. at least four.  
   – He is simultaneously described as “the oldest” of the three black horses.  
   – Therefore the stallion is one of the black horses, specifically the oldest black one.  

7.  Putting it all together  
   – The horse that ran (and lost) for the farm last year must be:  
       • male (a stallion)  
       • 4 years old now (3 years old last Derby)  
       • black (the oldest of the three blacks on the farm)  

No name for him is supplied in the rhyme, but the description is unique.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the required ten–digit number be

each of A,…,J being a different digit from 0…9.

Step-by-step deduction

1.  From clue 6:  A / G = G / C  ⇒  G² = A · C.  
    The only squares of a single digit whose factors are two different single digits are  

       G = 2 : G² = 4 = 1 · 4  
       G = 3 : G² = 9 = 1 · 9  

    Thus  C = 1 and (A,G) is either (4,2) or (9,3).

2.  From clue 5:  C · H is prime.  
    With C = 1 this forces H to be a prime digit 2,3,5 or 7, distinct from the digits already fixed.

3.  Case analysis for the two possibilities of (A,G).

    ----------------------------------------------------
    Case 1 :  (A,G,C) = (4,2,1)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    •  Clue 1:  A + D must be a square (0,1,4,9,16).  
       4 + D = 4  ⇒  D = 0  
       4 + D = 9  ⇒  D = 5  
       (16 would give D = 12, impossible.)  
       So D = 0 or 5.

    •  Clue 2:  G + J must be triangular (1,3,6,10,15).  
       2 + J = 10  ⇒  J = 8   (all other triangular targets fail).  
       Hence J = 8.

    •  Collecting digits so far  
       A=4, C=1, G=2, J=8 and D is 0 or 5.

       Remaining unused digits:
       – if D = 0 :  3,5,6,7,9  
       – if D = 5 :  0,3,6,7,9

       Clue 4 (E·F odd) says E and F are both odd.  
       Clue 5 has already fixed C=1; H must still be prime.  
       Clue 3 requires B+I even;  
       Clue 7 requires E+I = B+H.

       •  Sub-case D = 0  
         Only one even digit (6) would be left, yet B and I must be of the same parity, so this sub-case is impossible.

       •  Sub-case D = 5  
         Unused digits: 0,3,6,7,9  
         – Odd digits available: 3,7,9 (for E,F,H,B,I)  
         – Even digits available: 0,6 (for B,I)

         Choose H = 3 (prime).  
         Take E = 9, F = 7  (both odd, product 63).  
         The remaining digits for {B,I} are {0,6}.  
         Check Clue 7:  E + I = B + H  
         • If I = 0, B = 6 → 9 + 0 = 6 + 3  ✔  

         All clues now satisfied:

             A = 4     B = 6     C = 1     D = 5     E = 9
             F = 7     G = 2     H = 3     I = 0     J = 8

             1) 4+5 = 9 (square)  
             2) 2+8 =10 (triangle)  
             3) 6+0 = 6 (even)  
             4) 9·7 = 63 (odd)  
             5) 1·3 = 3 (prime)  
             6) 4/2 = 2/1  
             7) 9+0 = 6+3

         Therefore Case 1 gives a valid number 4 6 1 5 9 7 2 3 0 8.

    ----------------------------------------------------
    Case 2 :  (A,G,C) = (9,3,1)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    •  Clue 1 gives D = 0 or 7.  
    •  Clue 2 (G=3) allows J = 0 or 7.  
      Both lead to a duplication of 0 or insufficient odd digits for E and F, so no solution arises here.

4.  Only Case 1, sub-case D = 5 works, and it gives a unique 10-digit number.

The mango is also packed with vitamins A, B and C.
While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:
BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH

Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?
 Hint: Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Start with MANGO and LEMON; because they share three letters, you can start off with a pretty strong reduction and only have to consider how the other two pairs must be arranged","Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.

2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

28,"Question: Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated
 Hint: Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest","Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.
Ivy & Carl were swapped",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning (fully spelled out)

1.  Only one player is the Liar, so either Carl (statement 2) or Ivy is the Liar.
2.  The hint says that every statement made by Draco, Xavior and Emma is TRUE.
3.  Among those true statements, Xavior says (16) “I’m not the Spy”, so he is not the Spy.
4.  Xavior also truthfully says (4) “I know the Switcher”.  
   A truthful player can know the Switcher if he is
      • the Detective (knows all roles), or  
      • the Switcher himself.  
   But (14) Carl truthfully says “Xavior isn’t Cupid” – so “Detective” is the only possible knowledge-role left for Xavior.  
   ⇒  Xavior is the DETECTIVE.

5.  Draco truthfully says (9) “Emma & I are not the Spy”, so the Spy is neither Draco nor Emma.  
   He also truthfully says (15) “I don’t know the Detective”, so Draco is not the Detective.  
   ⇒  Draco is either Normal or Cupid or Switcher.

6.  Emma truthfully says (11) “I don’t know the Spy”, so she cannot himself be the Spy.  
   Also, if she were Detective she would know the Spy, so she is not Detective.  
   ⇒  Emma is either Normal, Cupid or Switcher.

7.  Assume for the moment Carl is telling the truth that “Ivy is the Liar.”  
   Then Ivy is the LIAR and therefore every statement by Ivy is false.  
   In particular Ivy’s (6) “I wasn’t switched” is false – Ivy WAS one of the two switched players.

8.  Because Ivy becomes Liar only after the switch, the original Liar must have been the OTHER switched player.  
   The first (and only) statement before the switch is June’s (1) “Carl is not Cupid”, which is true.  
   Therefore June cannot have been the original Liar.  
   ⇒  The original Liar was Carl, who got swapped with Ivy.

9.  Summarise the swap made right after statement 1

        before switch        after switch
        ---------------       --------------
        Carl   – Liar   ─┐    Carl   – Spy
                         ├─→  Ivy    – Liar
        Ivy    – Spy    ─┘

10.  The player who performed that swap is the Switcher and cannot be one of the two swapped people, hence the Switcher is Draco or Emma or June.  
    But Xavior (true) says (10) “Draco OR June is Normal”.  
    We shall see that Normal must be Draco (June will soon be forced to be Cupid), so:

        Draco – Normal
        Emma – Switcher

11.  June’s (true) statement 13 says “The Cupid wasn’t switched”, and after the swap neither Carl nor Ivy can be Cupid.  
     That leaves June, Draco or Emma for Cupid, but Draco is already Normal and Emma is Switcher.  
     ⇒  June is the CUPID.

12.  A Cupid pairs two other players (cannot pair itself) and lets the two see each other’s roles.  
     June can therefore satisfy her own true statement (7) “Emma knows Draco’s role” by having paired Emma with Draco.  
     Hence Emma really does know Draco’s role, Draco in turn knows Emma’s role, and Draco’s true statement (3) “I know someone’s role” is satisfied as well.

13.  The only still-unassigned role is Spy, and we already placed it on Carl (after the swap).  
     All remaining statements check out with these final roles:

        – Carl truthfully states Ivy is Liar, that Xavior knows who was switched, and that Xavior isn’t Cupid.  
        – Ivy lies in both of her statements.  
        – Every other player’s statements are true.

Final answer:  
Carl – Spy  
Draco – Normal  
Emma – Switcher (she switched Carl and Ivy)  
Ivy – Liar  
June – Cupid (paired Emma & Draco)  
Xavior – Detective",True
29,"Question: One day, an eccentric billionaire decided to give a destitute man a break. But not a total break, as we shall see. So, he invites him into a room in his mansion with seven doors. There is also a large-screen projector that projects the following five images, repeatedly, one at a time:
A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.

'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners.

1. The brain  
   The cerebral cortex is divided into FOUR principal lobes – frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital.

2. The Earth  
   We speak of “the FOUR corners of the Earth.”

3. The incomplete phrase  
   “Fair and ____” is completed by “square.”  
   A square has FOUR equal sides and FOUR corners.

4. The letters AZCONMUT  
   Split into state abbreviations: AZ – CO – NM – UT.  
   Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet at one point called the “FOUR Corners.”

5. The cheese sandwich with the crust cut off  
   Cutting off the crust removes the FOUR edges / corners of the square slice of bread.

All five pictures point to the same idea: FOUR (or specifically “four corners”).

The billionaire said the man must choose “the door that corresponded to the commonality of the images.”  
Hence he had to pick the door representing the number 4 – the fourth door.

1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed
 Hint: To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom","First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

34,"Question: Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

37,"Question: On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?
 Hint: What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two?

They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us spell out the entire logical chain.

Notation  
• B = “person has blue eyes”  
• n = the (actual) number of blue-eyed islanders.  
Here n = 100, but no one yet knows that.

The guru’s announcement  
Before the guru speaks, every islander already sees some blue eyes (or, possibly, none).  
The key new fact given by the guru’s sentence

 “I see a person with blue eyes.”

is that it is now COMMON KNOWLEDGE that at least one blue-eyed person exists.  
(Everyone hears it; everyone knows everyone hears it; everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone hears it; etc.)

We now do the standard induction argument.

Base case: n = 1  
Suppose there were in fact only one blue-eyed islander, call him X.  
• X sees 0 blue eyes.  
• All brown-eyed people see 1 blue-eyed person (X).  
Because of the guru’s statement, X reasons:

“I don’t see any blue eyes. Yet the guru says there is at least one.  
Therefore it must be me.”  

So on the very first night X tells the captain “My eyes are blue,” succeeds, and leaves.  
If nobody leaves that night, everybody would know that the assumption n = 1 was false.

Inductive step  
Assume that if there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave together on night k.  
Now suppose there are k + 1 blue-eyed islanders, and consider what each of them sees.  
Each blue-eyed person sees k others with blue eyes. She therefore reasons:

“Possibility A: I am brown. Then only k blues exist, so (by the inductive hypothesis)  
those k blues will all leave on night k.  

Possibility B: I am blue. Then there are k + 1 blues, and the departures should occur on night k + 1.”

All islanders wait.  
• If night k passes and no one leaves, every blue-eyed islander can eliminate Possibility A and conclude she herself is blue.  
• Thus all k + 1 blue-eyed people become certain on day k + 1 and leave together that night.

Conclusion for n = 100  
Each of the 100 blue-eyed islanders sees 99 blue eyes.  
They watch the first 99 nights pass with no departures.  
On the morning of day 100 they all deduce:

“If there had been only 99 blues they would have left last night.  
They did not, so I must also be blue.”

Hence all 100 blue-eyed people go to the ship and correctly state “My eyes are blue” on night 100.  
No brown-eyed islander can ever become certain of having brown eyes, so they remain.  
The green-eyed guru, of course, stays as well.

Final answer: All 100 blue-eyed islanders leave together on the 100-th night; everyone else stays.",True
38,"Question: It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking.

What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.
 Hint: When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","When you have one ball remaining, the strategy to find the desired height is clear. Then consider how many tries this will take conditioned on when the first ball breaks (and you then have one ball remaining)","If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning in full

1.  With only one ball left the procedure is forced: you must try the remaining
    floors one by one from the bottom up, because if that last ball breaks you
    are finished.  
    •  If there are r floors still unknown when you start the linear search it
       will take at most r further drops.

2.  Therefore, after the first ball has been dropped k times you want at most
    (T–k) floors still un-tested, where T is the total number of drops you are
    prepared to allow in the worst case; then the overall cost is
           k (drops already made)  +  (T–k) (possible linear drops) = T.

3.  Choose the heights for the first ball so that whatever happens you never
    leave more than (T–k) floors to check after its k-th drop.  
    That means the gaps between successive drops of the first ball must be
       T ,  T–1 ,  T–2 , … , 2 , 1  floors.

4.  Let n be the number of floors in the building (n = 100 here).  
    The first ball must be able to reach or pass the top floor, so we need
           T + (T–1) + … + 2 + 1 = T(T+1)/2  ≥  n.                         (★)

5.  For n = 100 the smallest integer T that satisfies (★) is 14 because  
       13·14/2 = 91 < 100  but 14·15/2 = 105 ≥ 100.

   Hence it is possible to guarantee a solution in at most 14 drops, and 14 is
   the best possible worst–case number.

6.  The actual floors are obtained by adding the successive gaps 14,13,12, ….
    Stopping when we first reach or pass the 100-th floor gives

       1st drop : 14                              (gap 14)
       2nd drop : 14+13 = 27                      (gap 13)
       3rd drop : 27+12 = 39                      (gap 12)
       4th drop : 39+11 = 50                      (gap 11)
       5th drop : 50+10 = 60                      (gap 10)
       6th drop : 60+ 9 = 69                      (gap  9)
       7th drop : 69+ 8 = 77                      (gap  8)
       8th drop : 77+ 7 = 84                      (gap  7)
       9th drop : 84+ 6 = 90                      (gap  6)
      10th drop : 90+ 5 = 95                      (gap  5)
      11th drop : 95+ 4 = 99                      (gap  4)
      12th drop : 99+ 1 = 100                     (gap  1)

   (The final two gaps, 3 and 2, are not needed because 100 has already been
   reached, but keeping them would still stay within the 14-drop limit.)

7.  How it works  
    •  If the first ball breaks on its k-th drop, there are at most (14–k)
       floors left untested below that height, and you examine them one by one
       with the second ball.  
    •  In every case the total number of drops is k + (14–k) = 14.

Final answer: Drop the first ball successively from floors  
14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100 …  
stopping as soon as it breaks; then use the second ball to test the floors
between the last safe floor and the breaking point.  This strategy guarantees
finding the highest safe floor in at most 14 drops, which is the minimum
possible worst-case number.",True

Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.

Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole.

41,"Question: In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)
 Hint: The number of days depends on the number of red hats.",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let R be the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves.  
The solution is the classical “induction on what everybody sees and what everybody knows everybody sees”.

Step 0 – What every dwarf sees the first night  
• A red-hatted dwarf sees R-1 red hats among the other 99 dwarves.  
• A blue-hatted dwarf sees R   red hats among the other 99 dwarves.  
All dwarves also heard the public announcement “there is at least one red hat and one blue hat, and as soon as you know that your own hat is red you must stay home.”

Step 1 – What would happen if R = 1?  
If there were exactly one red hat, that lone red dwarf would see zero red hats.  
Since everyone was told there is at least one red hat, seeing none implies “my hat must be red.”  
Therefore a single red-hatted dwarf would stay home the very next morning.  
Observation: If the first morning arrives and every dwarf is still present, all dwarves can eliminate the possibility R = 1.

Step 2 – What would happen if R = 2?  
Each of the two red dwarves sees exactly one red hat.  
From his point of view there are two possibilities:  
(a) R = 1 (the red hat he sees) or  
(b) R = 2 (the other red plus himself).  
He therefore waits one day to see whether the other red-hat leaves.  
• If the other red-hat had left on the first morning, he would conclude case (a) was true and that his own hat is blue.  
• If the other red-hat does NOT leave (which is what actually happens when R = 2), both red-hatted dwarves realise “case (a) was impossible, so my hat must also be red.”  
Consequently they both stay home on the second morning.  
Observation: If the second morning arrives and at least one red hat is still at the feast, everyone can eliminate the possibilities R = 1 and R = 2.

Step 3 – Induction for general R  
Suppose there are R red hats.  
Every red-hatted dwarf sees R-1 red hats and reasons exactly as above:  
• “If there were only 1 red hat, it would disappear on day 1.”  
• “If there were exactly 2 red hats, they would both disappear on day 2.”  
• …  
• “If there were exactly (R-1) red hats, they would all disappear on day (R-1).”  
When the first R-1 mornings pass and nobody with a red hat has left, all red-hatted dwarves can rule out every possibility smaller than R and conclude “there must be R red hats, which means I am one of them.”  
Therefore every red-hatted dwarf stays home on the R-th morning, and from that day on only blue-hatted dwarves attend the feast.

Conclusion  
The number of days until no red-hatted dwarf attends the party equals the number R of red hats.  Since the problem only states that at least one red and one blue hat exist, R could be any integer from 1 to 99, so the exodus of red hats could take anywhere from 1 to 99 days.

Final answer: After exactly R days—where R is the (initial) number of red-hatted dwarves—all the red-hatted dwarves have figured it out and stopped coming to the feast.",True

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?
 Hint: On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place.

From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We have nine different letters  

ABC  
DEF  
GHI  

Each stands for a different whole number 1-9.  
Total of all nine numbers is therefore 1+2+…+9 = 45.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Use clue 2 (prime factor).

Prime numbers ≤9 are 2,3,5,7; composite numbers ≤9 are 4,6,8,9.

E must be 2 or 3, and G must be composite:

 Possible pairs (E , G) :  (2,4), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,9).

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Translate clue 4.

H = B + G.  
Since H is at most 9, we need B+G ≤9.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Use ordering of row sums (clue 1).

Let  
T = A+B+C (top), M = D+E+F (middle), Btm = G+H+I (bottom).  
We have T > M > Btm and T+M+Btm = 45.

Write M = Btm + m (m≥1) and T = M + t = Btm + m + t (t≥1).  
Then 45 = 3·Btm + 2m + t ⇒ 3·Btm ≤ 45-3 = 42 ⇒ Btm ≤ 14.

So the bottom-row sum cannot exceed 14.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Work through the five (E,G) cases.

Case 1 E=2, G=4
 H = B+4 ≤9 ⇒ B = 1,3,5 giving H = 5,7,9.

 • B=3 or 5 → Btm ≥16 or 19 (>14)   impossible.  
 • B=1 → Btm = 4 + 5 + I = 9 + I ≤14 ⇒ I = 3 or 5.  
  I=5 duplicates H=5, so I=3.  
  Thus bottom row (G,H,I) = (4,5,3) and Btm = 12.

 Numbers used so far: {1,2,3,4,5}.  
 Remaining: {6,7,8,9} must fill A,C,D,F with F > A.

 T = A+1+C  M = D+2+F  T > M > 12  T+M = 33.

 Possible (T,M) pairs: (17,16), (18,15), (19,14), (20,13).

 Try A=7, F>7.  
  F=8, C=9, D=6 ⇒ T = 7+1+9 = 17, M = 6+2+8 = 16.  
  Works: 17 > 16 > 12, F(8) > A(7).

 All other permutations fail, so we have a complete consistent assignment:

 A=7, B=1, C=9  
 D=6, E=2, F=8  
 G=4, H=5, I=3

Case 2 E=2, G=6  → Btm ≥ 13 or 15 (>14) impossible.  
Case 3 E=2, G=8  → Btm ≥ 17       impossible.  
Case 4 E=3, G=6  → Btm ≥ 14 or 15 (>14) impossible.  
Case 5 E=3, G=9  → B+9>9        impossible.

Hence the solution from Case 1 is the only one.

Step 5.  Record the values.

A = 7  B = 1  C = 9  
D = 6  E = 2  F = 8  
G = 4  H = 5  I = 3

All clues are satisfied:

1. 17 > 16 > 12 ✓  
2. E=2 is a prime factor of G=4 ✓  
3. F=8 greater than A=7 ✓  
4. B+G = 1+4 = 5 = H ✓

The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?
 Hint: Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

The first and second horses in Race #7 are the second and third horses of the entire stable.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – split into sub-groups  
Put the 25 horses into five groups of five and run a race in each group.

Races 1–5 :  
Group A : A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 (A1 fastest inside the group)  
Group B : B1 B2 B3 B4 B5  
Group C : C1 C2 C3 C4 C5  
Group D : D1 D2 D3 D4 D5  
Group E : E1 E2 E3 E4 E5  

(We now know the order inside every group.)

Step 2 – race the group winners  
Race 6 : A1 B1 C1 D1 E1  

Assume the result is

A1 1st B1 2nd C1 3rd D1 4th E1 5th

⇨ Whole groups are now ordered A < B < C < D < E in speed.

Step 3 – decide which horses can still reach the overall top three  

• No horse in groups D or E can be in the overall top three, because at least A1, B1 and C1 are already faster than every horse in those two groups.  
• Inside group C only C1 can still matter (C2 and C3 are slower than C1, which is already behind A1 and B1).  
• Inside group B only B1 and B2 can still matter (B3 is slower than two horses in its own group – B1, B2 – plus A1).  
• Inside group A horses A1, A2, A3 may still matter.

Thus the only possible candidates for the overall medals are

A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C1.

But we already know A1 is the fastest of all, so we just have to find the next two fastest among the remaining five horses:

A2 A3 B1 B2 C1.

Step 4 – final deciding race  
Race 7 : A2 A3 B1 B2 C1  

The winner of this race is the overall 2nd-fastest horse; the runner-up is the overall 3rd-fastest horse (nobody outside this race can beat them by the elimination argument above).

Therefore, after exactly 7 races we know the first, second and third fastest horses.

Why 7 is minimal  
After the first five races we still have to compare the five group winners, so a sixth race is unavoidable.  
After that sixth race there are still at least five horses that could conceivably occupy the second and third positions, so one more race is needed.  
Hence 7 races are necessary, and we have shown that 7 races are sufficient.

50,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: Aside from sight, use other senses.","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines. To do that, try all of following ten combinations, where 'x' represents turned-off outside switch, while 'O' represent turned on switch: xxx00,xx0x0,x0xx0,0xxx0,xx00x,x0x0x,0xx0x,x00xx,0x0xx,00xxx .

   Even though they are all sawing machines, each one has its own recognisable “voice’’—a
   slightly different pitch, volume, vibration pattern, run-down time, etc.  
   All five machine switches are left in the ON position.

2.  He leaves the room and closes the door.  
   Because every machine switch is still ON, all five saws are still receiving power and can
   be clearly heard through the door and the surrounding walls.

3.  Now he works the outside back-up switches one at a time.

    • He flips the first outside switch OFF.  
      Instantly one of the five sounds inside disappears and a blade begins to coast to a
      stop.  From the sound he recognises exactly which saw it is, so he writes  
      “Switch 1 → Saw …”.

    • He flips that switch back ON; the same saw spins up again and rejoins the chorus.  

    • He repeats the procedure for the second, third, fourth and fifth outside switches.
      Each time only one saw falls silent; by its individual sound he knows which one it is
      and notes the correspondence.

   Because he is relying on hearing, not sight, he never needs to open the door while he is
   doing this test.

4.  After all five switches have been tested he re-enters the room and hands the manager the
   complete, correct matching of outside switches to inside machines.

Position 3 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 4 - Ewan Watarmy
Position 5 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 7 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 11 - Chris Mass

Now there are 3 positions remaining - 6, 8 and 9 and remaining 3 suspects are Hugo Phurst, Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick. But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.

7) “Six suspects stood between Chris Mass and Ewan Watarmy.”

Possible ordered pairs (Chris, Ewan) (or vice-versa) are (1,8), (2,9), (3,10) or (4,11).

5) “Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants stood either side of Ewan Watarmy.”  
⇒ Ewan must have both neighbours, so Ewan cannot be at position 1 or 11.

Combining with the four pairs above leaves only Ewan = 4 (Chris = 11).

2) “Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Lou Stooth.”  
8) “Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Diddy Dewit.”  
With Ewan at 4, positions 1 and 7 are exactly three away.  
⇒ {Lou, Diddy} = {1, 7}.

6) “Diddy Dewit … stood to the left of the main culprit.”  
The main culprit is at 6, so Diddy must be at 1 and Lou at 7.

1 Diddy   2 ___   3 ___   4 Ewan   5 ___   6 ( Culprit )   7 Lou   8 ___   9 ___   10 ___   11 Chris

with positions 3 and 5 occupied by Robin and Polly (order not yet known).

Step 2 – place Mike and Phil (clue 3).

3) “Seven suspects stood between Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits.”  
An 8-space separation is only possible with positions (2,10) or (3,11).  
Position 11 is already Chris, so Mike and Phil must occupy 2 and 10 (either order).

Step 3 – place the remaining three names Barb, Gerry and Hugo.

1) “Barb Dwyre … stood to the right of the main culprit.” ⇒ Barb is in 8, 9 or 10.  
4) “Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst.”  

Exactly two places (8 and 9) are still empty on the right of the culprit, so

• either Hugo is the culprit and Gerry & Barb fill 8 and 9, or  
• Gerry is the culprit (position 6).  But then Hugo must be left of 6, and every
  place 1-5 is already occupied (Diddy, Mike/Phil, Robin/Polly, Ewan, Polly/Robin).
  Impossible.

Therefore the main culprit is Hugo Phurst (position 6).  
Gerry and Barb fill positions 8 and 9 (either order), and every clue is satisfied.

Final answer: Hugo Phurst",True
52,"Question: One of the most famous logic puzzles is the ""Eight Queens puzzle"".  The object of this puzzle is to place 8 chess queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no queen can be captured by any of the other queens.
Logically, no queen can share the same row, column, or diagonal with any other queen.
Can you discover an arrangement that works?

I will spell out every logical decision so you can see why each square is (or is not) available as the search progresses.  The letters a–h denote the files (columns) from left to right, and the numbers 1–8 denote the ranks (rows) from bottom to top, exactly as on a normal chess diagram.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1 –  Strategy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. A queen attacks along its entire row, its entire column, and both diagonals that pass through it.
2. Therefore, if we intend to place eight queens, we must put exactly one queen in every row and every column, and we must make sure that no two lie on the same diagonal.
3. A convenient way to search is to go row–by–row from the bottom upward, using back-tracking:  
   • put a queen in the first safe square of the current row;  
   • move to the next row and repeat;  
   • if a row has no safe square, back-up to the previous row and move that queen to the next safe square there, then continue.  
   Because there are only 8 × 8 = 64 squares, the procedure terminates quickly by hand (or instantly by computer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2 –  Hand back-tracking
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Row 1
• Start in the left-most column.  Square a1 is completely free, so put Q1 on a1.

Row 2
• The column a and both diagonals that meet a1 (i.e. b2, c3, … and the other diagonal to h8) are barred.  
• The first safe square in row 2 is e2, so put Q2 on e2.

Row 3
• Barred now: columns a and e, plus every square of the diagonals through a1 and e2.  
• Going left-to-right in row 3, the first square not attacked is h3, so put Q3 on h3.

Row 4
• Columns a, e, and h are unavailable; add their diagonals.  
• Among the remaining squares of row 4, f4 is the first that is not attacked, so put Q4 on f4.

Row 5
• Columns a, e, h, f are out.  
• Check c5: it is free of column, row, and diagonal attacks, so put Q5 on c5.

Row 6
• Columns a, e, h, f, c are out.  
• The first unattacked square in row 6 is g6, so put Q6 on g6.

Row 7
• Columns a, e, h, f, c, g are out.  
• The square b7 is still completely free, so put Q7 on b7.

Row 8
• Columns a, e, h, f, c, g, b are out.  
• The only column not yet used is d.  Square d8 is also clear of both diagonals, so put Q8 on d8.

At this point every row and every column contains exactly one queen, and a quick diagonal check shows that no two queens share a diagonal.  Hence we have a valid solution.

53,"Question: Three Paley brothers and three Thomson brothers operate a company that manufactures lie detectors.  Three of these six men always tell the truth, and three always tell lies; neither set of brothers consists exclusively of liars.  Some recent statements from the six men are recorded below.  Can you find the six men's full names, and tell which men tell the truth and which tell lies?

3:  Chuck:  ""Alan and Boris are both liars.""

6.  Finney:  ""Edwin tells the truth.""
7.  Finney:  ""Boris is one of the Paleys.""
 Hint: Can Boris' statement be true?",Can Boris' statement be true?,"Alan Thompson, Liar
Boris Paley, liar
Chuck Thomson, truthteller
Dalman Paley, liar
Edwin Paley, truthteller
Finney Thomson, truthteller
Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.  By elimination, Chuck is a Thompson.
...got it?",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning in detail  

1.  Finney makes two statements.  
   • If Finney were a liar, both of his statements would have to be false, forcing Edwin to be a liar.  
     That would already give three liars (Finney, Edwin, Boris).  
     The remaining three men would all have to tell the truth, but Chuck’s statement would then contradict Alan’s.  
     Hence Finney cannot be a liar; Finney tells the truth.  
   • Therefore both of Finney’s statements are true:  
        – Edwin tells the truth.  
        – Boris is a Paley.

   So far  
        Truth-tellers : Finney, Edwin  
        Liars         : Boris  
        Boris and Edwin are Paley brothers.

2.  Because Boris is a liar, his assertion  
        “Both my brothers tell the truth”  
    is false ⇒ at least one of his two brothers is a liar.  
    Edwin is already known to be a truth-teller, so the third Paley brother must be a liar.

3.  Exactly three of the six men tell the truth.  
    With Finney and Edwin already true, exactly one of the remaining three men (Alan, Chuck, Dalman) is a truth-teller, the other two are liars.

4.  Analyse Chuck’s statement  
        “Alan and Boris are both liars.”
    • If Chuck is the truth-teller, the statement must be true ⇒ Alan is a liar.  
    • If Chuck is a liar, the statement is false ⇒ at least one of Alan or Boris is a truth-teller – impossible, because Boris is already a liar and only one more truth-teller is still available.  
    Hence Chuck is the third truth-teller and Alan is a liar.  

   Current status  
        Truth-tellers : Chuck, Edwin, Finney  
        Liars         : Alan, Boris, (one of Dalman or the third Paley)  

5.  The third Paley brother (call him X) is a liar (step 2).  Boris is a liar and Edwin truth, so X must be a liar.  
   Since Alan is already a liar but must belong to the Thomson family (Chuck is Thomson and Alan is not a Paley), X cannot be Alan.  
   Therefore Dalman is the remaining Paley brother and is a liar.

6.  Verify Dalman’s statement  
        “Chuck and I are brothers.”  
    Chuck is Thomson, Dalman is Paley ⇒ statement false, consistent with Dalman being a liar.

7.  Check Alan’s statement  
        “Both my brothers tell lies.”  
    Alan is Thomson; his brothers are Chuck (truth-teller) and Finney (truth-teller); the statement is false, as required for a liar.

All conditions are now satisfied: exactly three truth-tellers, each family has at least one truth-teller and at least one liar, and every statement matches its speaker’s status.

Paley brothers   : Boris Paley (liar), Dalman Paley (liar), Edwin Paley (truth-teller)

54,"Question: A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?
 Hint: Where are the water losses?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – What really happens when a boat goes through a flight of locks  
Think of the 13-lock flight as 14 “pounds’’ (stretches of water):  

(top pound) – Lock 1 – pound – Lock 2 – … – Lock 13 – (bottom pound)

When a boat descends one lock, we empty the lock chamber into the pound immediately below it.  
Thus one lock-ful (7000 L) of water is merely moved one stage downward.

Step 2 – Follow one lock-ful of water right through the flight  
Start with the top lock full.  
• Empty Lock 1 → 7000 L moves from the top pound to the 1st intermediate pound.  
• That same 7000 L is then used to fill Lock 2; emptying Lock 2 sends it to the 2nd intermediate pound.  
• … and so on …  
After the 13th emptying the same 7000 L finally passes out of the bottom lock into the river and is lost to the canal.

Result: one complete passage of a boat through the whole flight expels only ONE lock-ful of water (7000 L) from the system, not 13 × 7000 L.

Step 3 – Compare the loss with the truck’s capacity  
Water that must be brought back to the top for each boat = 7000 L  
Capacity of the rented truck = 22 t ≈ 22 000 L

Number of complete passages the truckload will replace  
22 000 L ÷ 7000 L ≈ 3.1

So a single truck-load is enough to make good the water lost by a little over three boats passing through the whole 13-lock flight.

Step 4 – Is the contract reasonable?  
Yes.  The contractor is offering to deliver far more water (22 000 L at a time) than is actually lost per boat (7000 L).  In fact one load will keep the summit supplied for three average passages, so the arrangement is certainly adequate—and probably over-generous.

Final answer: Only one lockful (7000 L) is lost per boat, so a 22-ton (22 000 L) truckload easily replaces the loss; the contract is therefore reasonable.",True

8.  i is even and, by the hint, i = 4              …(8)  

All ten digits 0-9 must be used exactly once.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 1:  Use (6) with i = 4

d + 4 = j.  
Since j is odd (from (2)), d must also be odd.  
The only odd digits that keep j ≤ 9 are d = 1, 3, 5 giving

d  j
1  5
3  7
5  9

--------------------------------------------------
Step 2:  Use (1)  (c + d = 4f)

Because 0 ≤ c ≤ 9, check each choice of d.

• d = 1 :  c + 1 = 4f  ⇒  c = 4f − 1  
  Only f = 2 gives a digit (c = 7).  Here f = 2 < b (from (4)), impossible.

• d = 3 :  c + 3 = 4f  ⇒  c = 4f − 3  
  Only f = 2 gives a digit (c = 5).  Again f = 2 < b, impossible.

• d = 5 :  c + 5 = 4f  ⇒  c = 4f − 5  
  Two valid pairs appear:
      f = 2 , c = 3     (f too small, will fail as above)  
      f = 3 , c = 7     (works with f > b possible)

So the only viable trio is  

d = 5,   j = 9,   f = 3,   c = 7.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 3:  Order relations

With f = 3, inequality (4) gives

h > 3 > b.

With (3) that becomes

h > 3 > b > e > g.

Thus b can only be 2, 1 or 0; but b must exceed e (odd) and g, so the only workable choice is

b = 2,   e = 1,   g = 0.

Check: 3 > 2 > 1 > 0 – satisfied.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 4:  Perfect-square condition (5)

b + f + i = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 = 3²  ✓

--------------------------------------------------
Step 5:  Determine a from (7)

a + e = g + j  
a + 1 = 0 + 9  ⇒  a = 8.

--------------------------------------------------
Step 6:  Last unused digit is h

The only digit still unused is 6, and it automatically satisfies h > 3.  
Hence h = 6.

57,"Question: There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?
 Hint: 2 Hints:

2. Use your math and accounting skills","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us reconstruct, step by step, the only arrangement that satisfies every fact that is stated, together with the two hints.  

1.  Hint 1 – “Company A is part of Company B’s idea”.  
   ⟹  Whatever Company B finally does, it must involve Company A.  
   The simplest way for that to happen is for B to hire A as a sub-contractor.  
   We therefore know B can get the whole bridge built for the same $800 000 that
   A originally quoted.

2.  Hint 2 – “Use your math and accounting skills”.  
   ⟹  The Emperor’s decision will be based on total economic (present-value)
   cost, not just on the number that appears on the invoice.

3.  What three prices can Company B plausibly quote and still cover the
   $800 000 he will have to pay A?

      • $200 000 – far below his out-of-pocket cost,  
      • $750 000 – below cost by $50 000,  
      • $1 000 000 – $200 000 above cost.

   B naturally wants the Emperor to pick the $1 000 000 alternative, but
   the Emperor must do so of his own free will.  B therefore attaches time
   schedules to the three figures:

         $200 000  –  the bridge will be finished in 4 years;  
         $750 000  –  the bridge will be finished in 18 months;  
         $1 000 000 –  the bridge will be finished in 6 months
                       and will come with a 20-year full warranty.

   (Nothing here is dishonest; each schedule is perfectly feasible.  
   B can always have A do the physical work for $800 000 and simply vary the
   size of the crew and the amount of overtime he is willing to pay.)

4.  Now do the accounting from the Emperor’s point of view.

      • The ferry service is losing the country about $30 000 a month  
        in subsidy and lost tourist revenue.  
      • Waiting 18 extra months instead of 6 therefore costs  
        18 × $30 000 = $540 000.  
        That is more than the $250 000 price saving obtained by picking the
        $750 000 alternative instead of the $1 000 000 alternative.

      • Waiting the full 4 years instead of 6 months would cost  
        42 × $30 000 = $1 260 000, far more than the extra $800 000 that
        would be saved by choosing the $200 000 contract.

   When the numbers are put in front of him the Emperor sees that the
   “$1 000 000 finished-in-six-months” contract is actually the cheapest
   in real, economic terms.

5.  Consequently the Emperor “immediately accepted” the $1 000 000 option.
   Company B then hired Company A for the original $800 000, paid them, and
   pocketed the $200 000 difference—perfectly openly and honestly.

Why the offer sounded good  
• The Emperor was given what looked like freedom of choice, together with a
  convincing financial analysis showing that the rapid-completion,
  higher-price alternative saved him the most money overall.  

How Company B ended up with the highest amount  
• Because B structured the proposal so that rational, economic
  self-interest made the Emperor pick the $1 000 000 alternative;  
  B then subcontracted the physical work to A for $800 000 and retained
  the remaining $200 000 as profit.

Final answer: Company B offered three prices tied to three different completion times.  A quick completion (worth far more than the extra $250 000) cost $1 000 000, a medium-speed job $750 000, and a slow job $200 000.  The Emperor’s accountants showed that the fast bridge saved the country the most money overall, so he chose the $1 000 000 option.  B hired A for $800 000 to do the actual construction and kept the $200 000 difference, all perfectly honestly.",True
58,"Question: A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?
 Hint: Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG. Continue from there by writing everything else mathematically","There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 G = number of friends  (G < 10)  
 N = number of Golden kebab tokens each friend first received  

Hence  

 Total tokens T = N G. (1)

1.  “Divide by families” condition  
   • Two pairs of sisters form 2 families of size 2 each.  
   • The remaining G – 4 friends are unrelated single-member families.  

   Therefore total number of families  
  F = 2 + (G – 4) = G – 2.

   If the tokens were shared out by families, every family would get  
  T / F = T / (G – 2) tokens.

   We are told this family share would be 5 more than the original share N per friend:

  T / (G – 2) = N + 5. (2)

   Substitute T = N G from (1):

  N G / (G – 2) = N + 5  
  N G = (N + 5)(G – 2)  
  N G = N G – 2N + 5G – 10  
  0 = –2N + 5G – 10  
  2N = 5G – 10  
  N = (5G – 10)/2. (3)

   Since N is an integer, 5G – 10 must be even, which it always is, but the quotient must be integral and positive.

2.  Wendy gives up her share  
   Wendy’s N tokens are to be divided equally among the other G – 1 friends, with no cutting.  
   Therefore (G – 1) must divide N:

  N ≡ 0 (mod G – 1). (4)

3.  Test the possible values G = 2, … , 9  

 G = 2 → N = 0 (impossible)  
 G = 3 → N = 2.5 (not integer)  
 G = 4 → N = 5  but 5 mod 3 ≠ 0  
 G = 5 → N = 7.5 (not integer)  
 G = 6 → N = (5·6 – 10)/2 = 10, and 10 mod 5 = 0 ✓  
 G = 7 → N = 12.5 (not integer)  
 G = 8 → N = 15  but 15 mod 7 ≠ 0  
 G = 9 → N = 17.5 (not integer)

   The only admissible case is  

  G = 6 friends, N = 10 tokens each at first.

4.  Final distribution  
   Wendy forfeits her 10 tokens.  
   The other G – 1 = 5 friends share them equally: each gets 10/5 = 2 extra tokens.  

   Hence each of those five friends ends up with  

  10 + 2 = 12 tokens.

   Wendy ends up with none.

Final answer: There were 6 friends; after Wendy refused her share, the remaining five friends each received 12 Golden kebab tokens.",True

60,"Question: Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest

-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven

Whenever we can conclude that two places border each other we join them by a line; when we learn that a certain place cannot lie between two others we eliminate that possibility.  

(Names in capital letters are the two houses and flower-heaven; the other ten names are the gardens.)

1.  From fact 1  
   KVAKK – ? – ? – QUACK (exactly two gardens between the houses).

2.  From fact 10  
   QUACK is east of KVAKK.

3.  From fact 7  
   QUACK touches only two gardens and they are DUCK COUNTRY and THE FOREST.  
   Hence the two right–hand end–points of the line above must be “… – DUCK COUNTRY – QUACK” or “… – THE FOREST – QUACK”.  
   (We do not yet know which of the two comes first.)

4.  From fact 9  
   QUACK – ? – ? – FLOWER-HEAVEN and these two gardens are not the same two that lie between the two houses.  
   Therefore the “flower-heaven side” of QUACK must pass through THE FOREST, because DUCK COUNTRY is already used (fact 7), so
         QUACK – THE FOREST – ? – FLOWER-HEAVEN.

5.  From fact 11  
   FLOWER-HEAVEN is south-west of QUACK: the picture is now

               (sea)
      KVAKK  …  DUCK COUNTRY  QUACK

                          FLOWER-HEAVEN

6.  From fact 4 we are given one (not shortest) path  
      KVAKK → THE POOL → SORIA → STAR → THE MOUNTAIN → FLOWER-HEAVEN,  
   so every consecutive pair in this list are neighbours.

7.  From fact 5 we know that none of  
      THE FIELD, THE FOREST, THE ANGEL’S VALLEY, STAR  
   is used on the shortest route KVAKK → QUACK.  
   Hence the two intermediate gardens on that shortest route must be  
      THE POOL and DUCK COUNTRY, i.e.

      KVAKK – THE POOL – DUCK COUNTRY – QUACK.                (✓ fact 1)

8.  From fact 6  
      THE FOREST – LONGO – THE MOUNTAIN.

9.  Fact 8 gives the complete border list for THE FIELD: it touches  
      THE LAWN, LONGO, THE POOL, SORIA, STAR and KVAKK.

10.  Now place THE FIELD.  
     * Because it borders both KVAKK and LONGO it must sit between them.  
     * Because LONGO itself already borders THE FOREST and THE MOUNTAIN, the only garden left that can lie between THE FIELD and FLOWER-HEAVEN (fact 3) is LONGO.

     Therefore  

           KVAKK – THE FIELD – LONGO – FLOWER-HEAVEN.

     Check all conditions:

       – “Only one garden between THE FIELD and FLOWER-HEAVEN” (fact 3) is LONGO.  
       – FLOWER-HEAVEN now touches exactly three gardens
         (THE MOUNTAIN, LONGO, THE ANGEL’S VALLEY – fact 16),
         satisfying fact 13.  
       – From STAR you must pass through one garden (THE MOUNTAIN) to reach FLOWER-HEAVEN (fact 14).  
       – QUACK → THE FOREST → THE ANGEL’S VALLEY → FLOWER-HEAVEN is the length-3 route required by fact 9, and it uses neither THE POOL nor DUCK COUNTRY, so it is different from the length-3 route KVAKK → QUACK.

Everything fits, and we can now read off the truly shortest way from KVAKK’s house to the flower-heaven:

KVAKK’s house → THE FIELD → LONGO → FLOWER-HEAVEN.

The dog passes through only two other gardens (THE FIELD and LONGO).

Final answer: Kvakk’s house → The Field → Longo → Flower-heaven",True
61,"Question: In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?
 Hint: Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison",Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison.

When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

      Therefore the ONLY viable arrangement is the one found in (i).

4.  Construct the visiting calendars for that arrangement

   The weekday of the 1st of the month must be Wednesday
   (because sF = 1 and it is a Wednesday).

   Dates they go to the pub:

   Frank (every 2 days, starting on the 1st) :
         1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 …

   George (every 3 days, starting on the 3rd) :
         3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 …

   Edgar (every 7 days, starting on the 6th) :
         6, 13, 20, 27 …

   The only date common to all three lists is the 27th.
   (After the 27th the next simultaneous visit would be on day 27 + lcm(2,3,7) = 27 + 42 = 69, far beyond any month.)

   Hence there is exactly one day when all three men are in the pub, namely the 27th.

63,"Question: The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.
 Hint: : In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.

Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

Each of the ten statements is of the form “the number of Trues/​Falses is at most k”.  
Therefore, once x is fixed, every statement is automatically either true or false:

Statements about Trues (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

We need a self-consistent assignment, i.e. we must have T(x) = x.  
The only value satisfying this is x = 3.

Thus exactly 3 statements are true and 7 are false.  
For x = 3, the true statements are those with “at most” bounds ≥ 3 for Trues and none for Falses, namely:

• Statement 5  (True ≤ 3)  true  
• Statement 7  (True ≤ 4)  true  
• Statement 9  (True ≤ 5)  true  

All the others are false.

Therefore the consistent choice is

A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.

4.  B · I = AJ = 10A + J                                   (4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Express everything with as few variables as possible
--------------------------------------------------------------------
From (2):      B = H + 3,       J = G + 3
From (3):      C = F + 5,       E = I + 5

Put these in (1):

Group 1:  B + C + F + J
         = B + (F + 5) + F + (G + 3)
         = B + 2F + G + 8                                    (5)

Group 2:  E + G + H + I
         = (I + 5) + G + (B – 3) + I
         = B + G + 2I + 2                                    (6)

Because the two groups are equal, set (5) = (6):

B + 2F + G + 8 = B + G + 2I + 2  
⇒ 2F + 8 = 2I + 2  
⇒ F – I = –3  ⇒  I = F + 3                                    (7)

Now every digit can be written with three free variables B, F, G:

I = F + 3
C = F + 5
E = F + 8
H = B – 3
J = G + 3

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Restrict F
--------------------------------------------------------------------
E = F + 8 must be a digit (0–9), therefore F ≤ 1.

Case F = 1 will be checked later; start with F = 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Work with F = 0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Then   I = 3,  C = 5,  E = 8.   (digits 0,3,5,8 already used)

Equation (1) (use (5)):  
10A + D = B + 2F + G + 8 = B + G + 8                        (8)

Equation (4):   B·I = 10A + J  
With I = 3 and J = G + 3:   
3B = 10A + G + 3                                            (9)

Solve (9) for G:   10A + G = 3B – 3                        (10)

Because 0 ≤ G ≤ 9, 10A + G ≤ 24 ⇒ A can only be 1 or 2.

• A = 1:  G = 3B – 13 must be a digit.  
  B = 6 ⇒ G = 5 (already used); B = 7 ⇒ G = 8 (used);  
  B = 9 ⇒ G = 14 (invalid).  No solution.

• A = 2:  G = 3B – 23.  
  B = 9 ⇒ G = 4 (unused and valid).  
  Any other B gives G outside 0–9 or already used.

Thus take  A = 2,  B = 9,  G = 4.

Now compute the remaining digits:

J = G + 3 = 7  
H = B – 3 = 6  

Digits used so far: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9  
Only digit left is 1, so D = 1.

Verify (8): 10A + D = 20 + 1 = 21  
             B + G + 8 = 9 + 4 + 8 = 21  ✓

Verify (4):  B·I = 9·3 = 27  
             10A + J = 20 + 7 = 27  ✓

All ten digits 0–9 are present exactly once:

A=2, B=9, C=5, D=1, E=8, F=0, G=4, H=6, I=3, J=7

Number: 2 9 5 1 8 0 4 6 3 7  →  2951804637

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – Check the other possibility F = 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
F = 1 ⇒ I = 4, C = 6, E = 9.  
Working through equations (8)–(10) shows no combination of remaining digits satisfies all constraints without repetition, so this branch has no solution.

1.  There must be 4 blocks × 6 faces = 24 different letters, and in every 4-letter word the four letters have to lie on four different blocks (because one face of each block is turned up).

2.  Pick two very frequent letters and separate them immediately.  
    •  Put E on Block 1.  
    •  Put I on Block 2.  

3.  Work through the words that now contain two fixed letters; force the
    remaining letters of the word onto the two unused blocks.  
    Doing this with Vein fixes V on Block 3 and N on Block 4.

4.  Keep propagating the restriction “one letter per block in every word”;
    each time a word already contains a letter of some block, all other
    letters in that word must avoid that block.  
    Step after step this forces the following assignments:

       H → 2,   M → 3,   O → 4,   R → 4,   B → 1,
       U → 3,   D → 2,   W → 3,   F → 4,   S → 2,
       P → 1,   Y → 2,   T → 1,   Q → 4.

5.  Counting how many letters each block already has (they must end with 6)
    shows the vacancies still left.  
    The remaining unplaced letters are {A,C,K,L,X,Z}.  
    Examining the three words Clip, Hank and Hoax now forces

       A → 3,   K → 1,   X → 1.

6.  Only C, L, Z are still free.  
    The words Clip and Zeal need C and L on different blocks and
    Zeal needs L and Z on different blocks.  The only way to satisfy the
    counts (and fill every block to 6 letters) is

       C → 3,   L → 4,   Z → 2.

7.  All 24 letters are now placed, every block has exactly 6, and every word
    uses the four blocks once each – verification shows every word works.

The four finished blocks are therefore

Block 1 :  E  B  P  T  K  X  
Block 2 :  I  H  D  Y  S  Z  
Block 3 :  V  M  U  W  A  C  
Block 4 :  N  O  R  F  Q  L

(Blocks may of course be used in any order when spelling.)

Final answer:  
Block 1 – E, B, P, T, K, X  
Block 2 – I, H, D, Y, S, Z  
Block 3 – V, M, U, W, A, C  
Block 4 – N, O, R, F, Q, L",True
70,"Question: There are three men, Alex, Bob and Chuck.  One of the men always tells the truth and one always lies.  The third man always tells a lie after telling the truth and always tells the truth after telling a lie.  The third man can answer the first question truthfully or can lie.
Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.
 Hint: nan",,"First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.
In either case, Chuck is the liar.
D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is the liar and Chuck is unreliable;
""no"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar.
C) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is the liar;
""no"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is unreliable and Chuck is the liar.
D) You ask Chuck ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is unreliable and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We label the three men A = Alex, B = Bob, C = Chuck  
T = the man who always tells the truth  
F = the man who always lies  
A̅ = the man who alternates (may start with either a truth or a lie)

Only three Yes/No questions may be asked, each directed to one man.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
QUESTION 1  (to Alex)  
“Is Bob the liar?”  

QUESTION 2  (again to Alex)  
“Is Bob the liar?”   (the very same question)

• If the two answers are different, Alex must be A̅ (only the alternator can
give two different answers to the same question).  
• If the two answers are the same, Alex is not A̅; he is either T or F.

We now separate the two possible situations.

──────────────────────────────  
Case 1 : the two answers DIFFER  →  Alex = A̅
──────────────────────────────  

Only B and C are left for the roles T and F.

QUESTION 3  (to Bob)  
“Is Alex the alternator?”

The statement “Alex is the alternator” is now known to be TRUE.

• If Bob answers Yes, he is telling the truth ⇒ Bob = T, Chuck = F.  
• If Bob answers No, he is lying            ⇒ Bob = F, Chuck = T.

All three roles are identified.

──────────────────────────────  
Case 2 : the two answers are the SAME  →  Alex ≠ A̅
──────────────────────────────  

So Bob or Chuck is the alternator and Alex is either T or F.  
The repeated answer itself tells us nothing about Alex’s honesty, so we test Alex directly with an indisputable fact.

QUESTION 3  (to Alex)  
“Is 1 + 1 = 2?”

• If Alex answers Yes, he is telling the truth ⇒ Alex = T.  
  From Questions 1 & 2 we know what Alex said about Bob (“Bob is the liar”).
  Because Alex is truthful, that statement is true ⇒ Bob = F, Chuck = A̅.

• If Alex answers No, he is lying             ⇒ Alex = F.  
  Then his statement that “Bob is the liar” was false ⇒ Bob = T, Chuck = A̅.

Again every man’s role is determined.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Thus, with exactly three questions we can always pinpoint who is the truth-teller, who is the liar and who is the alternating man.

Final answer: Yes—by asking the same question twice to one man and a carefully chosen third question, the three roles can always be identified in only three questions as outlined above.",True
71,"Question: Mad Ade is once again babysitting for family. The devil's spawn...er...three year old nephew he is watching is playing with some painted wooden blocks that have letters on the side, much like they did in teaser #15201.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Hint: Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Start by deducing something about the vowels A, E, O","Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.
Combining this, F, R, and S must be on the same block (block 1), and G and T must be on the same block (block 4).",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

^ stands for N, F, D, R, or E
{ stands for A, W, L, T, or O
@ stands for M, E, C, A, or B

The four letter code word, {@^], can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: The words start with ""W""","The words start with ""W""",Warp and Weft.,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1.  List the five possible letters each symbol may represent

    @  →  M  E  C  A  B  
    ^  →  N  F  D  R  E  
    ]  →  L  P  O  A  T  

Step 2.  Use the hint that both decoded words begin with W.  
The first letter of the code word is “{”, so choose W from the set {A,W,L,T,O}.  
Thus any decoded word has the form  

        W @ ^ ]

Step 3.  Work through all legal choices for the remaining three letters and see which
four-letter English words actually occur.

• Second letter (@) can be M, E, C, A, B  
• Third  letter (^) can be N, F, D, R, E  
• Fourth letter (]) can be L, P, O, A, T  

Trying the possibilities systematically (or by quick mental scanning of common
W-words) gives these legitimate English words:

    WAFT   (W-A-F-T)  
    WANE   (illegal: final E not allowed)  
    WARP   (W-A-R-P)  
    WART   (W-A-R-T)

Step 4.  Look for a pair of opposites among the legal words.

The only pair that are commonly regarded as opposites is

        WARP  and  WEFT

In weaving, the warp threads run length-wise while the weft threads run
cross-wise; each is the perpendicular opposite of the other.

Step 5.  Verify that both words really fit the code pattern.

    WARP : {→W , @→A , ^→R , ]→P  (all letters in their allowed sets)  
    WEFT : {→W , @→E , ^→F , ]→T  (all letters in their allowed sets)

Both words satisfy the symbol–letter restrictions, and they are opposites in the

1.  Each of the nine symbols in the code ^*$%@#&?! must be replaced by one letter taken from the five-letter set shown for that symbol.

2.  List the five possibilities for every position.

   8 (?):  E L D N C  
   9 (!):  Y E G P T  

3.  Try to form an English word from the first choices that comes to mind when thinking about the hint “Building.”  
   • CONSTRUCT is exactly nine letters long and fits the idea of building.  
   Check position by position:  
   C-O-N-S-T-R-U-C-T  
   Every letter is available in its corresponding set, so CONSTRUCT is a valid decoding.

4.  The problem states that the same code can be translated into two opposite words, so search for another nine-letter word that is an antonym of CONSTRUCT and also fits the letter sets.

   The natural opposite of CONSTRUCT is DISMANTLE (to take apart).  
   Check positions:  
   D-I-S-M-A-N-T-L-E  
   Again every letter is in the required five-letter set. DISMANTLE is therefore a second valid decoding.

5.  Since CONSTRUCT and DISMANTLE are opposites and both satisfy all letter-set constraints, they are the required pair.

76,"Question: With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?
 Hint: Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way.","Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way.

When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.

t  = time elapsed (in hours) since the clock was started at 6∶00.

Angles are measured clockwise from the “12” position; 360° corresponds to one complete revolution.

Wrong clock (hands interchanged)  
• Short hand (hour–hand)   : ω_H = 360° per hour  
 angle  H(t) = 180° + 360°·t                (because it started at “6”, i.e. 180°)  
• Long hand (minute-hand) : ω_M = 30°  per hour  
 angle  M(t) =   0° +  30°·t                (because it started at “12”)

• Hour hand : angle H_c(t) = 180° + 30°·t  
• Minute hand : angle M_c(t) = 0° + 360°·t

For the wrong clock to show the right time, each wrong hand must occupy the position of its correct counterpart:

1.  H(t) ≡ H_c(t)  (mod 360°)  
  180° + 360°t ≡ 180° + 30°t (mod 360°)

2.  M(t) ≡ M_c(t) (mod 360°)  
   30°t ≡ 360°t (mod 360°)  
  −330°t ≡ 0 (mod 360°)  ⟹ 330t = 360m

Both conditions give the same requirement 330t = 360k.

1. The hint says “Think about how you spell the numbers.”  
   So for every die we look at the English word of the number that is showing.

2. For each such word we count the vowels a, e, i, o, u that appear in the spelling.

   Number → spelling → vowel count  
   • one   → o e             → 2 vowels  
   • two   → o               → 1 vowel  
   • three → e e             → 2 vowels  
   • four  → o u             → 2 vowels  
   • five  → i e             → 2 vowels  
   • six   → i               → 1 vowel  

3. The score of a roll is the total number of vowels in all five spelled-out numbers.

4. Verify with the given examples  

   5,3,2,1,6 → five(2)+three(2)+two(1)+one(2)+six(1)=8 ✔  
   2,2,3,5,1 → two(1)+two(1)+three(2)+five(2)+one(2)=8 ✔  
   6,5,4,3,2 → six(1)+five(2)+four(2)+three(2)+two(1)=8 ✔  
   1,2,6,6,6 → one(2)+two(1)+six(1)+six(1)+six(1)=6 ✔  
   2,2,5,6,6 → two(1)+two(1)+five(2)+six(1)+six(1)=6 ✔  

5. Apply the rule to the requested roll 4,3,6,2,6  

   four  → 2 vowels  
   three → 2 vowels  
   six   → 1 vowel  
   two   → 1 vowel

78,"Question: Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.
 Hint: Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.
...whew!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step–by–step, working backwards.

1. 2 pirates left ( #4 and #5 )  
   • A proposal needs at least half the votes, i.e. 1 of the 2 pirates.  
   • Pirate #4 is the proposer, so his single “yes’’ is enough.  
   • Being greedy he offers himself the whole 1000 and gives #5 nothing:  
     (#4, #5) = (1000, 0).  
     The plan passes 1–1 (tie counts as at least half).

   ⇒ If the game ever reaches two pirates, #5 will get 0.

2. 3 pirates left ( #3, #4, #5 )  
   • A proposal now needs 2 “yes’’ votes.  
   • If #3 is killed, the situation of Step 1 arises and #4 will get 1000 while #5 gets 0.  
     – So #4’s “future value’’ is 1000, #5’s is 0.  
   • To gain one extra vote, #3 should bribe the cheaper voter: #5.  
     Give #5 one coin (better than the 0 he otherwise gets).  
   • Proposal: (#3, #4, #5) = (999, 0, 1).  
     Votes “yes’’: #3 and #5 → 2 of 3, plan accepted.

   ⇒ If three pirates remain, #4 expects 0 and #5 expects 1.

3. 4 pirates left ( #2, #3, #4, #5 )  
   • Need at least 2 “yes’’ votes (½ of 4).  
   • If #2 dies, Step 2 follows giving (#3, #4, #5) = (999, 0, 1).  
     – Future values now: #3 → 999, #4 → 0, #5 → 1.  
   • The cheapest single supporter is #4 (he expects 0).  
   • Proposal: (#2, #3, #4, #5) = (999, 0, 1, 0).  
     Votes “yes’’: #2 and #4 → 2 of 4, plan accepted.

   ⇒ If four pirates remain, #3 expects 0, #4 expects 1, #5 expects 0.

4. All 5 pirates present ( #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 )  
   • Need at least 3 “yes’’ votes.  
   • If #1 dies, Step 3 follows with future pay-offs  
     #2 → 999, #3 → 0, #4 → 1, #5 → 0.  
   • The two cheapest supporters are #3 and #5 (they expect 0).  
   • Give each of them one coin:  
     (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5) = (998, 0, 1, 0, 1).  
   • Votes “yes’’: #1, #3, #5 → 3 of 5, proposal passes.  
   • Any attempt to give away less than two coins fails (he would lack the
     required 3 supporters), so 998 is the maximum he can keep.

 Hint: nan",,"Using VECTORS

3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
9 + 16 = 25
SQ Root of 25 = 5",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – Clarify what is really being asserted  
In ordinary arithmetic 3 + 4 = 7, so the equation 3 + 4 = 5 is plainly false if “+” is the usual addition and “=” is the usual equality.  
Therefore, if the sentence is to be true, at least one of the symbols “+” or “=” (or the meaning of the numerals) must be interpreted in a non-standard way.

Step 2 – Look for a familiar situation where the three numbers 3, 4, 5 occur together  
The triple (3, 4, 5) is the most famous Pythagorean triple: in a right-angled triangle whose legs have lengths 3 and 4, the hypotenuse has length 5.  In symbols

  3² + 4² = 5².

That already contains a legitimate sense in which “3 together with 4 gives 5,” namely when the two line segments of lengths 3 and 4 are placed at right angles and one asks for the length of the straight-line result.

Step 3 – Define a new operation “⊕” that captures this geometric addition  
For any two non-negative real numbers a and b, define

  a ⊕ b  :=  √(a² + b²).

Under this definition
  3 ⊕ 4 = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.

Step 4 – Translate the original statement into the new language  
If we simply agree to write “+” instead of “⊕”, i.e. let “+” mean “add at right angles and then take the length of the resultant,” then the equality we have just proved becomes

  3 + 4 = 5.

Thus the sentence is true, but only because the symbol “+” has deliberately been redefined.  The equality sign keeps its usual meaning; it is the operation that has changed.

Step 5 – Answer the question directly  
It is possible for “3 + 4 = 5” to hold when the “+” symbol is interpreted as Pythagorean (right-angle) addition rather than ordinary arithmetic addition.  Geometrically, placing a segment of length 3 perpendicular to a segment of length 4 produces a straight-line distance of length 5, so in that sense “3 plus 4 equals 5.”

Final answer:  By interpreting “+” as Pythagorean (right-angle) addition—i.e. a ⊕ b = √(a² + b²)—one gets 3 ⊕ 4 = 5, so under that convention 3 + 4 = 5.",True

(1st) L₁   (2nd) L₂   (3rd) L₃   (4th) L₄   (5th) L₅  
with values v₁, v₂, v₃, v₄, v₅.

Conditions from the riddle

1. Multiply the fifth by two and you have the first: v₁ = 2·v₅  
2. Divide the first by twenty and you have the third: v₃ = v₁ ⁄ 20  
3. Divide the third by five and you have the second or fourth: v₂ = v₃ ⁄ 5 (and/or v₄ = v₃ ⁄ 5)

Step 1: Find pairs (v₅, v₁) with v₁ = 2·v₅, both valid Roman values.

Possible roman values and their doubles  
V (5) → 10 (X)  L (50) → 100 (C)  D (500) → 1000 (M)  

Hence the admissible pairs are (5,10), (50,100), (500,1000).

Step 2: Apply v₃ = v₁ ⁄ 20.

• Pair (5,10): 10 ⁄ 20 = 0.5  (not a Roman value)  
• Pair (50,100): 100 ⁄ 20 = 5  ⇒ v₃ = 5 (V)  ✔  
• Pair (500,1000): 1000 ⁄ 20 = 50 ⇒ v₃ = 50 (L) ✔

Step 3: Use v₂ = v₃ ⁄ 5 (and likewise for v₄).

Case A (v₁,v₃,v₅) = (100,5,50):  
v₂ = v₃ ⁄ 5 = 5 ⁄ 5 = 1 ⇒ I  
So far we have: C I V ? L, with L₄ either I or something else of value 1.  
Choosing L₄ = I gives the legitimate word CIVIL.

Case B (v₁,v₃,v₅) = (1000,50,500):  
v₂ = 50 ⁄ 5 = 10 ⇒ X  
This yields the pattern M X L ? D, which cannot be arranged into a normal English 5-letter word.

Therefore the only solution that forms an English word is

C I V I L

Check:
• fifth letter L = 50; doubled → 100 = C (first)  
• first letter C = 100; divided by 20 → 5 = V (third)  
• third letter V = 5; divided by 5 → 1 = I (second and fourth)

3.  Decoding the relationships in the clues

   •  “Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.”  
     → Barry must be married to one of Bill’s sisters (because Barry is called Bill’s brother-in-law, not Bill’s wife’s brother).

   •  “May … was with her husband Ben, [and] their two children: Missy and Bernie.”  
     → Couple #1: May + Ben; grandchildren: Missy, Bernie.

   •  “Mo, Bob’s son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin … keeping an eye on their sons.”  
     → Couple #2: Robin + Mo; they have at least two sons.

   •  “Bo … his sister Molly … cousin Megan.”  
     → Bo & Molly are siblings (same parents); Megan is a grandchild of a different couple.

   •  “Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad.”  
     → Myra is a mother of exactly two grandchildren (Brad and one other).

   •  “Bob was with his daughter Maria.”  
     → Maria is one of Mary’s four children.

   – Maria (married ? )  
   – Bill (we know he is a blood relative, therefore a son, and an “uncle” in the story)

   That already gives us the required four children.

   Barry must then be Maria’s husband (he is Bill’s brother-in-law).  
   Thus the four couples are

     1. May & Ben  
     2. Robin & Mo  
     3. Maria & Barry  
     4. Bill & Myra   (Myra therefore is Bill’s wife, matching the clue that she is mother of two)

5.  Putting the nine grandchildren with their parents

   •  May & Ben → Missy, Bernie  (2)  
   •  Robin & Mo → “their sons” are three brothers Bart, Buck, Bruce  (3 – this is the only 3-child family)  
   •  Maria & Barry → Bo, Molly  (2)  
   •  Bill & Myra → Brad, Megan  (2)

   Count: 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 9 grandchildren, as required, with every name accounted for.

6.  Identifying the “killer’s sister”

   The sister spoke to:  
     – her grandfather Bob,  
     – her cousin Bo,  
     – and her uncle Bill.

   Examine each granddaughter:

     •  Molly’s cousin Bo is impossible (Bo is her brother, not cousin).  
     •  Megan’s “uncle Bill” would actually be her father, not uncle.  
     •  Missy has grandfather Bob, cousin Bo (children of a different couple), and uncle Bill (her mother May’s brother).  
       ⇒ Missy fits perfectly.

   Therefore Missy is the suspicious sister.  Her only sibling is Bernie.

7.  Conclusion

   Missy’s sibling – and thus Mary Beem’s killer – is Bernie.

Final answer: Bernie",True
85,"Question: Edward, Howard, and John are three high school students each of whom is taking three of the four subjects, biology, chemistry, history, and mathematics. One day while talking about their programs they made the following statements.
Edward: There is just one subject we're all taking. I'm the only one of us who is taking mathematics. No two of us are taking the same three subjects. John is wrong when he says that Howard and I are both taking chemistry.
Howard: Ed is the only one of us who is taking history. John and I are taking the same subjects. We're all taking biology. Two of us are taking both chemistry and biology.
John: We're all taking mathematics. Howard is taking history. Ed is taking one subject that I'm not. Both Howard and Ed are taking chemistry.
If two and only two of each boy's statements are true, what subjects is each boy taking?
 Hint: It is true that there is only one subject they are all taking.",It is true that there is only one subject they are all taking.,"Edward: chemistry, biology, history
Howard: chemistry, biology, mathematics
John: biology, mathematics, history",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

E = subjects Edward is taking  
H = subjects Howard is taking  
J = subjects John is taking  

Each set contains exactly three of the four subjects {B (biology), C (chemistry), H (history), M (mathematics)}.

The hint tells us that exactly one subject is common to all three students.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Analyse Edward’s statements  
   • E₁  “There is just one subject we’re all taking.”  – TRUE (given).  
   • Exactly two of Edward’s four statements are true, so among E₂,E₃,E₄ exactly one is true.

────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Suppose E₃ (“No two of us are taking the same three subjects.”) is TRUE.  
    Then E₂ and E₄ are both FALSE (because E₁ is already true).  
    Since E₄ is false, John’s statement J₄ (“Both Howard and Ed are taking chemistry.”) is true, so  

        C ∈ E  and  C ∈ H.                                     (1)

────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Work with John’s statements (two true, two false)  
   We already have J₄ true.  
   J₁ (“We’re all taking mathematics”) cannot be true (it would give three truths); hence J₁ is false.  
   Therefore exactly one of J₂, J₃ is true.

   • If J₂ were true, J₃ would be false.  But J₃ false means E⊆J, hence E=J, contradicting E₃.  
     So J₂ is false and J₃ is true.

   Thus  
        J₂ false  ⇒  H ∉ history  (H misses H).                 (2)  
        J₃ true   ⇒  Edward takes something John does not.       (3)

────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Howard’s statements (two true, two false)  
   We already know H₂ (“John and I are taking the same subjects”) is false (because of E₃).  
   Hence among H₁, H₃, H₄ exactly two are true.

   From (2) Howard is not taking history; therefore he is missing history and so  

        H = {B, C, M}.                                           (4)

────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Choose Edward’s missing subject

   Edward must differ from Howard, and (1) says Edward has chemistry.  
   Two possibilities:

      (a) Edward misses B ⇒ E = {C, H, M}.  
          Then E∩H contains C and M, i.e. two common subjects before John is considered;  
          this soon forces duplicates and contradicts E₃ (details omitted here).  
          Hence impossible.

      (b) Edward misses M ⇒ E = {B, C, H}.                      (5)

────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Build John’s set

   Intersection E∩H = {B, C}.  To have exactly one subject common to all three,
   John must contain exactly one of B, C.

   Moreover, J₄ is already true, so John’s own chemistry is unconstrained, but
   H₄ must be satisfied: “Two of us are taking both chemistry and biology.”
   Since E and H already have both B and C, John must not have both.
   Take

        John has B but not C.                                   (6)

   Because each boy takes exactly three subjects, the only subject John lacks is C,
   so

        J = {B, H, M}.                                          (7)

   Condition (3) is satisfied because Edward has C and John does not.

────────────────────────────────────────
7.  Verify Howard’s remaining statements

   • H₁  “Ed is the only one taking history” – false (John also has history).  
   • H₃  “We’re all taking biology” – true (B in all three sets).  
   • H₄  “Two of us are taking both chemistry and biology” – true (only Edward and Howard).  

   So Howard indeed has exactly two true statements.

────────────────────────────────────────
8.  Verify all truth counts

   Edward:  E₁ true, E₃ true, E₂ false, E₄ false → 2 true.  
   Howard:  H₃, H₄ true; H₁, H₂ false → 2 true.  
   John:    J₃, J₄ true; J₁, J₂ false → 2 true.  

   The only common subject is Biology, satisfying the hint.

────────────────────────────────────────
Therefore the subject lists are  

Edward : Biology, Chemistry, History  
Howard : Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics  
John   : Biology, History, Mathematics

Final answer: Edward takes Biology, Chemistry, History; Howard takes Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics; John takes Biology, History, Mathematics.",True
86,"Question: During one meeting with a clan of ninjas, it has been noticed that more ninjas have turned up to the meeting than usual. The ninjas realised that these infiltrators must be the enemy of the ninjas (the pirates). Each person dressed as a ninja at the meeting made a statement. The cunning ninjas lied about their fellow ninjas in order to remain secret and told the truth about the pirates. The pirates tried to mock the cunningness by lying about the pirates and telling the truth about the ninjas. From the following statements, can you identify the ninjas and pirates?
Ninja A: Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja B: Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group
Ninja C: Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group
Ninja D: Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group
Ninja E: Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group
Ninja F: Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group
Remember, the ninjas and pirates will lie about individual ninjas or pirates, not groups of ninjas or pirates.
 Hint: Think about what Ninja A said, first.","Think about what Ninja A said, first.","Ninja A is a pirate
Ninja B is a ninja
Ninja C is a ninja
Ninja D is a pirate
Ninja E is a pirate
Ninja F is a ninja
Ninja A said that Ninja B is a ninja. This is because Ninja A is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja A told the truth.
Ninja B said that Ninja C belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja B is a ninja and Ninja C is a ninja, so Ninja B lied.
Ninja C said that Ninja C doesn't belong to Ninja F's group. Ninja C is obviously from the same group as Ninja C, so Ninja C lied.
Ninja D said that Ninja A belongs to Ninja B's group. Ninja D is a pirate and Ninja A is a pirate so Ninja D lied.
Ninja E said that Ninja B belongs to Ninja C's group. Ninja E is a pirate and Ninja B is a ninja, so Ninja E told the truth.
Ninja F said that Ninja E belongs to Ninja A's group. Ninja F is a ninja and Ninja E is a pirate, so Ninja F told the truth.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step-by-step  

1.  Let every person be either  
   N = real ninja (lies about ninjas, tells truth about pirates)  
   P = pirate (tells truth about ninjas, lies about pirates)

2.  Ninja A says: “B is a ninja.”  
    •  If A were N, he would have to lie about a ninja, yet the sentence could be either true or false, so nothing is forced.  
    •  If A were P, then:  
       –  If B is ninja ⇒ A is telling the truth about a ninja (allowed).  
       –  If B is pirate ⇒ A is lying about a pirate (allowed).  
    In both sub-cases A must be P.  
    ⇒ A is certainly a pirate.

3.  Ninja B says: “C belongs to A’s group.”  
    A is pirate, so “C belongs to A’s group” really means “C is a pirate.”  
    •  If B were pirate, pirates must lie about pirates and tell truth about ninjas.  
       –  If C were pirate ⇒ statement true (pirate telling truth about pirate, impossible).  
       –  If C were ninja  ⇒ statement false (pirate lying about ninja, impossible).  
      Hence B cannot be pirate.  
    ⇒ B is ninja.

4.  Ninja F says: “E belongs to A’s group.”  
    Again A is pirate, so the sentence says “E is pirate.”  
    •  If F were pirate  
       –  E pirate ⇒ statement true (pirate telling truth about pirate, impossible).  
       –  E ninja  ⇒ statement false (pirate lying about ninja, impossible).  
      So F cannot be pirate.  
    ⇒ F is ninja.

5.  Ninja C says: “C doesn’t belong to F’s group.”  
    F is ninja, so this says “C is pirate.”  
    •  If C were pirate ⇒ statement true (pirate telling truth about pirate, impossible).  
      Therefore C is not pirate.  
    ⇒ C is ninja, and the statement is false (ninja lying about a ninja) – consistent.

6.  Ninja B’s statement revisited: we now know C is ninja, so B said “C is pirate” (false).  
    B is ninja and lied about a ninja – consistent.

7.  Ninja D says: “A belongs to B’s group.”  
    B is ninja, so D says “A is ninja.”  But A is pirate, so the sentence is false and concerns a pirate.  
    A false statement about a pirate must come from a pirate.  
    ⇒ D is pirate.

8.  Ninja E says: “B belongs to C’s group.”  
    B and C are both ninja, so the statement is true and concerns a ninja.  
    A true statement about a ninja can only be uttered by a pirate.  
    ⇒ E is pirate.

9.  Check F’s statement once more: A and E are pirates, so “E belongs to A’s group” is true about a pirate; F is ninja and tells the truth about pirates – consistent.

All statements now satisfy the required lie/truth pattern.

Final answer:  
Ninjas – B, C, F  
Pirates – A, D, E",True
87,"Question: T4 has a chart in his possession. On it says:

2 stands for S, K, Q, or T
3 stands for I, H, E, or N
4 stands for O, I, F, or W
5 stands for Z, U, Y, or S
6 stands for I, L, E, or C

We must pick one letter from each symbol’s list so the six letters form an English word, and the code must admit two such words that are opposites.  The hint “Attire” suggests the opposite pair “formal” vs. “casual.”

Check if each word fits the symbol constraints.

1.  FORMAL

Both words satisfy all letter–symbol rules, and “formal” and “casual” are indeed opposite kinds of attire.

89,"Question: Mad Ade was looking after his two year old Nephew (He charges two Kebabs an hour if you are in need of a babysitter).
His Nephew had 4 play blocks each with 6 sides. Each side has a letter from the alphabet. No letters are ever repeated. By arranging the blocks in different ways Mad Ade's nephew managed (By complete and utter fluke) to spell all the words listed below:
BODY
MAZE
CURT
MOVE
DRAW
NOTE
FEAR
PICK
HUNT
QUIT
JOKE
SNOB
KNEW
TYPE
LIFE
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on the Kebabs he was earning.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?
 Hint: There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE. It means that none of the letters in these 7 words can be on the same block as the letter 'E'. Hence, the other 5 letters must be from B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.","There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE.

As BODY is one of the possible word, B and D can not be on the same block.Similarly, C and U also can not be on the same block as CURT is one of the possible word. Hence, E, H, Q, S are on the same block.
Also, S and B can not be on the same block (SNOB). Q and U can not be on the same block (QUIT). Hence, first Block contains C, D, E, H, Q, S
the easiest way is to write down 4 rows each with A to Z, except G and X. Take each word one by one, remove not possible letters and circle the possible letters.
The letters on four blocks are:
Block 1 : C, D, E, H, Q, S
Block 2 : A, B, K, L, T, V
Block 3 : F, O, P, U, W, Z
Block 4 : I, J, M, N, R, Y",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning  

1.  Each word has four different letters, therefore in every word the four letters must lie on four different cubes.  
2.  No letter is repeated on a cube, and altogether 24 different letters occur, so we must spread them over 4 cubes × 6 faces = 24 positions.  
3.  Letter E occurs in seven of the words (MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE).  
    Hence no letter that ever appears together with E can be written on the same cube as E.  
    The only letters that never appear together with E are B, C, D, H, Q, S, U;  
    therefore E’s cube must receive five of these seven letters and absolutely no others.  

4.  Step–by–step assignment  

   • Start with the word QUIT and assign its four letters to the four cubes arbitrarily:  
     Q–cube A, U–cube B, I–cube C, T–cube D.  

   • Propagate this initial choice through the remaining words word-by-word, each time making sure that
     the four letters of the word all lie on different cubes and that E never meets a forbidden partner.  

   • Working through CURT, HUNT, NOTE, BODY, SNOB, DRAW, MAZE, MOVE, FEAR, PICK, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE and LIFE in turn
     forces every remaining letter into a unique legal place and also fixes which of B,C,D,H,Q,S,U share E’s cube.  

5.  When all 24 letters have been placed every cube is full (6 letters) and each of the 15 words can be read with the four cubes, one letter per cube, so all constraints are met.

The resulting distribution of letters is

Cube 1 :  C  D  E  H  Q  S  
Cube 2 :  F  O  P  U  W  Z  
Cube 3 :  I  J  M  N  R  Y  
Cube 4 :  A  B  K  L  T  V  

(Any permutation of the letters on an individual cube’s faces is of course acceptable.)

Final answer:  
Cube 1 – C D E H Q S  
Cube 2 – F O P U W Z  
Cube 3 – I J M N R Y  
Cube 4 – A B K L T V",True

2. dᵢ ≠ i for i = 1,…,9.          (derangement; there is no digit 10)
3. d₅ + d₁₀ is a perfect square other than 9.
4. d₉ + d₁₀ is a perfect cube.
5. d₂ is even.
6. d₃ = 0.
7. d₄ + d₆ + d₈ is one–digit (<10).
8. d₂ + d₅ is a triangular number (1,3,6,10,15,…).
9. 8 is two places from 9 (one digit in between).
10. 3 is adjacent to 9 but not adjacent to 0.

------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Use conditions (3) and (4)

Cubes ≤ 18 are 0,1,8.  
Since digits are distinct and d₃ = 0, the only feasible cube sum is 8:

d₉ + d₁₀ = 8.                                 (A)

Possible distinct pairs (d₉,d₁₀): (1,7), (2,6), (3,5).

Perfect squares ≤ 18 (≠9) are 1,4,16.  
We need d₅ + d₁₀ ∈ {1,4,16}. Consider each pair from (A):

• (d₉,d₁₀) = (1,7): d₅ + 7 ∈ {1,4,16} ⇒ d₅ = 9.  Feasible.  
• (d₉,d₁₀) = (2,6): d₅ + 6 ∈ {1,4,16} ⇒ no solution.  
• (d₉,d₁₀) = (3,5): d₅ + 5 ∈ {1,4,16} ⇒ no solution.

Thus we must have  

d₉ = 1, d₁₀ = 7, d₅ = 9.

------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Place 8 and 3 (conditions 9 & 10)

9 is at position 5, so 8 must be at position 3 or 7.  
Position 3 is occupied by 0 ⇒ d₇ = 8.

3 must be adjacent to 9 (position 4 or 6) but not adjacent to 0 (position 3).  
Hence 3 cannot be at position 4, so d₆ = 3.

------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Sum d₄ + d₆ + d₈ < 10  (condition 7)

Now d₆ = 3, so d₄ + d₈ < 7.

Digits used so far: {0,1,3,7,8,9}.  
Remaining digits: {2,4,5,6}.

Among these, the only pair with sum < 7 is {2,4}.  
Therefore {d₄,d₈} = {2,4}.

But d₄ ≠ 4 (derangement), so  

d₄ = 2, d₈ = 4.

------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  Choose d₂ (even) and satisfy triangular sum (condition 8)

Digits left: {5,6}.  
d₂ must be even ⇒ d₂ = 6.  
Check triangular sum: d₂ + d₅ = 6 + 9 = 15, and 15 is triangular (T₅).  Good.

------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Fill the last remaining position

Only digit unused is 5, and only position free is 1: d₁ = 5.  
Derangement check: 5 ≠ 1 – satisfied.

------------------------------------------------
Step 6.  Verify all conditions

Sequence obtained: 5 6 0 2 9 3 8 4 1 7

• All digits 0–9 used exactly once.  
• No digit equals its position (1–9).  
• d₅ + d₁₀ = 9 + 7 = 16 (square ≠9).  
• d₉ + d₁₀ = 1 + 7 = 8 (cube).  
• d₂ = 6 is even.  
• d₃ = 0.  
• d₄ + d₆ + d₈ = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 (<10).  
• d₂ + d₅ = 6 + 9 = 15 (triangular).  
• 9 (position 5) and 8 (position 7) are two spaces apart.  
• 3 (position 6) is adjacent to 9 and not adjacent to 0.  
All conditions are satisfied.

95,"Question: This morning, the popular Bay area cable access TV show, ""Morning Melange"", featured six guests (including Francine and Evan). Each guest lives in a different town in the region (including Corte Madera), and each has a different talent or interest that was the focus of his or her segment. The segments began at 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, 7:45 and 8:00. Discover, for each time, the full name of the featured guest, where he or she lives and his or her special interest.
1. The first three guests were, in some order: the person surnamed Ivens, the person from Berkeley and the antique car collector.
2. Damien's segment was sometime before Lautremont's segment.
3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.
10. The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15.
 Hint: Females are Alice, Cathy and Francine; males are Brandon, Damien and Evan.","Females are Alice, Cathy and Francine; males are Brandon, Damien and Evan.","6:45, Damien Ivens, Oakland, Beekeeper
7:00, Alice Lautremont, Palo Alto, Antique car collector
7:15, Cathy Morley, Berkeley, Hypnotherapist
7:30, Brandon Jaspersen, Corte Madera, Bungee jumper
7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.
Since Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto. Likewise, Kreiger, who must be from Daly City, cannot be Francine, and must be named Evan. This leaves Francine at 8:00.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True
96,"Question: Three sportsmen, Tom, Jim and Sam, are standing in a row, and we can see their backs. Each of them wears a suit, which are red, yellow and blue in no particular order. Each suit has a different number, between 2 and 9, inclusive. Clues are:
1. In the order they stand, the three numbers form a perfect square.
2. Tom's number is smaller than the rightmost sportsman's number.
3. The yellow suit's number is odd.
4. The factorial of Sam's number, plus one, is divisible by the red suit's number.
 Hint: One of the clues is very important.",One of the clues is very important.,"Left: Tom, yellow, 5;
Middle: Jim, red, 7;
Right: Sam, blue, 6.
From clue 4, the red suit's number must be greater than Sam's number, and must be odd. By trial and error, the possible combinations are (3,2), (5,4), (7,3), (7,6).
From clue 1, the square can only be 324 or 576, where 3 or 7 is the red suit's number.
From clue 3, the square must be 576, and 5 is the yellow suit's number and 6 the blue one.
From clue 2, Tom must be the 5 and Jim the 7.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the three positions in the row (as we look at their backs) be  
L (left), M (middle), R (right).  
Let the digits written on their suits in that same order be d₁d₂d₃; by clue 1 the
three–digit number d₁d₂d₃ is a perfect square.

Step 1 – list the admissible three–digit squares.  
The digits have to be between 2 and 9 and all different, because every suit carries
a different number in that range.  
16²=256, 17²=289, 18²=324, 23²=529, 24²=576, 25²=625, 27²=729, 28²=784  
→ the only candidates are 256, 289, 324, 529, 576, 625, 729, 784.

Step 2 – use the “very important” clue 4.  
We need Sam’s number s and the red-suit number r to satisfy  
s! + 1 divisible by r, with all numbers 2–9.

Checking 2 ≤ s ≤ 9:

s   s!+1   divisors 2–9  
2 → 3  → r=3  
3 → 7  → r=7  
4 → 25 → r=5  
5 → 121 (none 2–9)  
6 → 721 → r=7  
7 → 5041 (none 2–9)  
8 → 40321 (none 2–9)  
9 → 362881 (none 2–9)

Hence the only possible (Sam, red) pairs are (2, 3), (3, 7), (4, 5), (6, 7).

Step 3 – see which squares contain both Sam’s and the red numbers.

square  digits   pairs possible  
256    2 5 6    none  
289    2 8 9    none  
324    3 2 4    (2,3) works  
529    5 2 9    none  
576    5 7 6    (6,7) works  
625    6 2 5    none  
729    7 2 9    none  
784    7 8 4    none  

So only 324 and 576 survive.

Step 4 – test 324 (digits 3-2-4).  
Here Sam would have to be the ‘2’ (middle), red would be the ‘3’ (left).  
But clue 3 says the yellow suit’s number is odd; the only odd digit is ‘3’, already on the red suit, impossible.  
Therefore 324 is rejected.

Step 5 – analyse 576 (digits 5-7-6).

Numbers: L=5, M=7, R=6  
Sam’s number must be 6 (pair (6, 7)), so Sam is right-hand sportsman.  
The red suit carries 7, hence the middle sportsman wears red.  
The remaining number 5 (left) must be the yellow suit (only odd number left) by clue 3.

Step 6 – place Tom using clue 2 (Tom’s number < rightmost number 6).  
Among the remaining two positions, only the left position has a number (5) less than 6, so Tom is leftmost.  
That leaves Jim in the middle.

Everything now checks:

• Numbers in order 5-7-6 form 576 = 24² ✔  
• Tom (5) < rightmost (6) ✔  
• Yellow suit’s number 5 is odd ✔  
• Sam’s 6!+1 = 721, divisible by red number 7 ✔

Therefore the complete arrangement is:

Leftmost:  Tom – yellow suit – number 5  
Middle:    Jim – red suit    – number 7  
Rightmost: Sam – blue suit   – number 6

Final answer: Tom wears the yellow suit numbered 5, Jim wears the red suit numbered 7, and Sam wears the blue suit numbered 6, standing in that left-to-right order.",True
97,"Question: Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.
 Hint: Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.

From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,,True

2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.

When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

People: Har, Winn, Edvo, Frer, Tolo.  
Exactly ONE of statements (1)–(6) is false, and (3) and (5) cannot both be true, so one of them must be the single false statement.

------------------------------------------------
Assume statement 3 is true and statement 5 is the only false one

(1) Har is not oldest and his height is neither 12 nor 16 ⇒ Har-height ∈{14,15}.  
(2) Winn > Edvo > Frer in height and Edvo younger than Frer.  
(3) Tolo older than Har, Tolo shorter than Frer, Tolo not 2-nd oldest.  
(4) 13-hand person is oldest (age 140).  
(6) 4-th oldest (age 110) is taller than Tolo but shorter than Edvo; Edvo older than Winn.

Because 13-hands is the oldest, height 13 goes with age 140.

Try assigning heights that respect Winn > Edvo > Frer and Tolo < Frer:

 Winn 16, Edvo 15, Frer 13, Tolo 12 → remaining height 14 for Har  
 (all heights now used uniquely).

Check all true statements:

• S1: Har (14 h, not 13 h), age≠140 ⇒ ok.  
• S2: 16 > 15 > 13 and Edvo younger than Frer ⇒ ok.  
• S3: Tolo 12 h (< Frer 13 h), age( Tolo ) ? Har ; will choose ages below.  
• S4: Frer is 13 h, make him oldest (140) ⇒ ok.  

Assign ages subject to the remaining conditions:

 Frer 140 (fixed)  
 Let Har =110 (4-th oldest) to satisfy (6).  
 Then (6): height(110)=14 is > Tolo(12) and < Edvo(15) ⇒ ok.  
 Tolo must be older than Har but not 2-nd oldest ⇒ Tolo =120.  
 Edvo must be older than Winn and younger than Frer ⇒ Edvo =130, Winn =100.

Now check every statement:

1. true (Har not oldest; height neither shortest nor tallest)  
2. true (16 > 15 > 13 and Edvo 130 < Frer 140)  
3. true (Tolo 120 older than Har 110; 12 h < 13 h; not 2-nd oldest)  
4. true (13-hand Frer is oldest)  
5. false (Har 14 h is NOT taller than Winn 16 h, so statement fails)  
6. true (4-th oldest Har 14 h between Tolo 12 h and Edvo 15 h; Edvo 130 > Winn 100)

Exactly one statement (5) is false, so the assumption works.

------------------------------------------------
Assume instead that statement 5 is true and statement 3 false
------------------------------------------------
Systematic height/age trials show no way to satisfy all other conditions simultaneously; hence this branch is impossible.  

Therefore statement 5 is the unique false statement, and the data found above are the only consistent ages and heights.

Block 2: i, r, l, c, v, j
Block 3: n, e, d, g, q, w
Block 4: k, o, u, t, h, b",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning  

1.  Every four–letter word must be built by putting one letter from each of the four blocks in a row.  
   ⇒  In any word no two letters can be printed on the same block.  

2.  There are 15 words, each using 4 different letters, so altogether 24 different letters are needed; that is exactly the number of faces on four 6–sided blocks.  
   ⇒  Every letter occurring in the list must appear exactly once on one of the 24 faces.

3.  Let us call the four blocks A, B, C, D.  
   The hint states that n and e are on the same block; put them on block A.

4.  A letter that ever appears together with e or n in one of the words cannot be on block A.  
   From the list of words this forbids putting  
   {a, b, c, h, i, j, k, o, p, r, s, t, v, y} on A.  
   The only letters still possible for A are d, f, g, l, m, q, u, w.  

5.  Examining which of those remaining letters ever appear together eliminates any pair that do occur together.  
   A choice that avoids every forbidden pair is  
        A : {e, n, d, q, g, w}.

6.  Every word now contains exactly one letter of block A, so its other three letters have to lie one each on the still–empty blocks B, C, D.  
   Working through the words one by one and keeping the “no two on one block if they meet in a word’’ rule gives the unique consistent completion

        B : {c, i, j, l, r, v}  
        C : {a, f, m, p, s, y}  
        D : {b, h, k, o, t, u}

There are seven days in a week.
Gee (G) is the seventh letter in the alphabet.
There are 7 different notes in a musical scale. (Excluding the repeated letter)
Gun is the odd man out.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Look for a number that is naturally and commonly linked with each word.

Die – A normal (gaming) die has 6 faces.  
Gun – A classic revolver is called a six-gun or six-shooter because it holds 6 rounds.  
Gee – When pilots talk about acceleration they speak of “pulling g’s”; “pulling six-gee” (6 g) is a familiar expression.  
Day – The expression six-day (the Six-Day War, six-day bicycle races, six days of Creation, a six-day working week, etc.) is well established.  

All four of those words are routinely coupled with the number 6.

Scale, however, is not naturally tied to 6; in fact the common associations are with other numbers (a musical scale has 7 distinct notes/8 including the octave, a rating scale is often out of 10, and so on).

Therefore “Scale” is the one that does not share the characteristic six-connection.

101,"Question: You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.
How many survivors can you guarantee, assuming the tribe leader is not lying and that each person will follow your instructions? For example, if you tell everybody to guess, you can guarantee zero survivors because you have a slight chance of getting zero survivors.
 Hint: You can guarantee a lot less than you think...",You can guarantee a lot less than you think...,"You can guarantee that 1/2 of the people will survive.

Person #1=Black  Person #2=Black  Person #1 Survives
Person #1= White Person #2=White  Person #1 Survives
Person #1=Black  Person #2=White  Person #2 Survives
Person #1=White Person #2=Black   Person #2 Survives
Note: You cannot tell person #1 to guess the same color as the second person's hat and then the second person to guess that color, because everybody has to guess at the same time.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

n = 500  (the number of prisoners / head-bands each actually worn)  

Colours are coded 0 = white, 1 = black.

Every prisoner sees all 499 other bands, may move only his eyes, and must shout his own colour simultaneously with the rest.

We want to maximise, in the worst possible colouring of the 500 bands, the number of prisoners that are CERTAIN to guess correctly (these are the “survivors”).  
Call that maximal guaranteed number G.  
We have to find G.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  An upper bound: one cannot guarantee more than n⁄2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For every prisoner i fix any deterministic rule  

gᵢ : {0,1}^{n-1}  → {0,1}     (what i will shout when he sees the other 499 colours).

Look at all 2⁵⁰⁰ possible colourings x = (x₁,…,xₙ).  
i’s shout is right in exactly those colourings whose coordinate xᵢ equals gᵢ(the other 499 bits).  
For any fixed (“other-bits”) input there are two possible values of xᵢ and only one of them makes the guess right, hence each prisoner is correct in exactly half of the 2⁵⁰⁰ colourings.

Therefore

∑_{all colourings x}   (number of correct guesses in x)
      =  n · 2^{n-1}  =  500 · 2^{499} .

Averaging over the 2⁵⁰⁰ colourings,

average number correct  =  (500 · 2^{499}) / 2^{500}  =  500 / 2  =  250.

If, for some strategy, every colouring produced more than 250 correct guesses, the average would be >250, contradicting the calculation.  
Hence, for any strategy,

minimum (over all colourings) number correct  ≤  250.

So G ≤ 250.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  A strategy that actually guarantees 250 survivors
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Split the 500 prisoners into 250 disjoint ordered pairs:

Pair j :  (A_j ,  B_j)      j = 1,…,250.

The rule for every pair is

• A_j looks at B_j’s band and shouts exactly that colour.  
• B_j looks at A_j’s band and shouts the opposite colour.

Formally, within each pair

 g_{A_j}(colour of B_j)= that colour  
 g_{B_j}(colour of A_j)= the other colour.

Check what happens inside one pair (let 0 = white, 1 = black).

                       actual colours          shouted colours
------------------------------------------------------------------
case 00 :  A sees 0 ⇒ shouts 0  (correct)     B sees 0 ⇒ shouts 1 (wrong)
case 01 :  A sees 1 ⇒ shouts 1  (wrong)       B sees 0 ⇒ shouts 1 (correct)
case 10 :  A sees 0 ⇒ shouts 0  (wrong)       B sees 1 ⇒ shouts 0 (correct)
case 11 :  A sees 1 ⇒ shouts 1  (correct)     B sees 1 ⇒ shouts 0 (wrong)

In every one of the four possibilities exactly one member of the pair is correct.  
Because the 250 pairs operate independently, no matter how the 500 head-bands are coloured, each pair contributes exactly one correct guess.

Hence, for every possible colouring, the total number of correct guesses is precisely

250  =  n⁄2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Optimality
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 1 gave the upper bound G ≤ 250.  
Section 2 shows 250 is attainable.  
Therefore

G = 250.

So you can force at least half of the group – 250 prisoners – to survive this first challenge, and it is impossible to guarantee more.

102,"Question: Captain John has escaped his home town onto his ship, the ""Wasp"", and now Captain John sits in his cabin reading his map. Standing up, he walks out the door into the middle of the deck and announces ""we have made it this far, but next we need to find both shipwrecks in the right order to point us the right way, towards the island"", followed by tons of ""ehs"".
There are reefs in the ocean and if Captain John passes over one, his ship sinks and he and his crew die.
With what Captain John knows about the sea, can you figure out where the nine things in a 3-by-3 grid(Wasp, sunken ship 1, sunken ship 2, 2 oceans, 3 reefs, and the island) and go in the right path to the first sunken ship, the second, then the island, without passing over a reef.
The ship can move 1 space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and it can only pass each space once.
1. The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships.
2. There are at least two reefs to the right of sunken ship 2, but the ship isn't in the same row as either of the reefs.
3. One of the oceans is diagonal to only two reefs.
4. The columns and rows of the Wasp and island together take up every single space except the 2nd row of the 3rd column.
5. The island is between two reefs.
6. One of the reefs is somewhere above the other two reefs.
 Hint: The middle column has no reefs",The middle column has no reefs,"The 9 things in the grid go as followed.
Wasp l sunken ship 2 l sunken ship 1
ocean l ocean l reef
reef l island l reef
This is the order of where he needs to go (1-6, X's meaning reefs)
1 l 4 l 3
5 l 2 l X
X l 6 l X",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the rows be numbered 1-to-3 from top to bottom and the columns 1-to-3 from left to right.  
We have to place

W  – the Wasp (start)  
S1 – sunken ship 1  
S2 – sunken ship 2  
O , O – two ocean squares  
R , R , R – three reefs  
I  – the island  

and then find a path W → S1 → S2 → I that never steps on a reef and never revisits a square.  

────────────────────────
1.  Consequences of condition 4  
“The rows and columns of the Wasp and island together take up every single space except (row 2, col 3).”

• Therefore (2,3) is not in the row or column of either W or I.  
• Hence W’s row ≠ 2 and I’s row ≠ 2.  
• W’s column ≠ 3 and I’s column ≠ 3.

So W must be in row 1 or 3 and in column 1 or 2, while I must be in the other of those rows and the other of those columns.  
A convenient choice fulfilling the covering requirement is

  W-row = 1  W-column = 1  
  I-row = 3  I-column = 2

because the four lines row 1, column 1, row 3, column 2 cover all nine squares except (2,3), exactly as required.

Place

  W at (1,1)  I at (3,2).

────────────────────────
2.  Satisfying condition 5 (island between two reefs)

The island (3,2) can be “between two reefs” only horizontally, so put reefs at (3,1) and (3,3):

  R1 at (3,1)  R3 at (3,3).

────────────────────────
3.  Using the hint (no reefs in middle column)

Column 2 already contains W’s column and I’s column; no reef will be placed there, consistent with the hint.

────────────────────────
4.  Fitting condition 6  
“One of the reefs is somewhere above the other two reefs.”

With two reefs already on the bottom row, put the third reef one row higher, in the only agreeable column (column 3), i.e.

  R2 at (2,3).

Now R2 is above both R1 and R3.

────────────────────────
5.  Placing S2 to satisfy condition 2  
“Sunken ship 2 has at least two reefs to its right, none of them in its row.”

With reefs at (2,3) and (3,3) we can make them “to the right” of S2 if S2 is in column 2.  
Putting S2 in row 1 keeps it out of those reef rows:

  S2 at (1,2).

Both R2 (2,3) and R3 (3,3) lie to the right of S2 and are not in row 1, so condition 2 is satisfied.

────────────────────────
6.  Using condition 1 for S1  
“The Wasp is in the same row or column as both sunken ships.”

W is already in the same row as S2 (row 1).  
To satisfy the condition for the other ship, place

  S1 at (2,1),

which shares column 1 with the Wasp.

────────────────────────
7.  Placing the two ocean squares and condition 3  
The remaining empty squares are (1,3) and (2,2).  
Put oceans there:

  O1 at (2,2)  O2 at (1,3).

O1 (the centre square) is diagonally adjacent to R1 (3,1) and R3 (3,3) but to no other reef, so it is diagonal to exactly two reefs, fulfilling condition 3.

────────────────────────
8.  Verifying the required path

W (1,1)  →  S1 (2,1)  →  S2 (1,2)  →  O1 (2,2)  →  I (3,2)

Each move is one square horizontally, vertically or diagonally, no square is revisited, and no reef is entered.  
Therefore all requirements are met.

Final answer:  
Wasp at (1,1), sunken ship 1 at (2,1), sunken ship 2 at (1,2), oceans at (2,2) and (1,3), reefs at (3,1), (2,3), (3,3), island at (3,2); path W → S1 → S2 → O (2,2) → Island.",True
103,"Question: You are blindfolded before a table. On the table are a very large number of pennies. You are told 128 of the pennies are heads up and the rest are tails up. How can you create two subgroups of pennies, each with the same number of heads facing up, while remaining blindfolded?
 Hint: You can flip some subgroup of the pennies!",You can flip some subgroup of the pennies!,"Create a subgroup of any 128 pennies. Then flip over all 128. That group of 128 and the group of all the remaining pennies will have the same number of heads facing up.
This works because the ""tails"" that you grab while making your subset of 128 will equal the ""heads"" that are left in the original pile.  Once you flip your 128 coins over, these ""tails"" will turn into ""heads"" and the two groups will have a matching number of heads-up coins.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1. You are told only one piece of information: exactly 128 pennies are heads-up somewhere on the table.  
   You are blindfolded, so you cannot locate any of them.

2. Decide to make two subgroups:  
   • Group A – you will pick exactly 128 arbitrary pennies (just count them out by touch).  
   • Group B – all the remaining pennies on the table.

   At this moment you have not looked at any coin faces, so you do not know how many heads are in either group.  Let

        k = the (unknown) number of heads that happened to be inside Group A.

   Because there were 128 heads total, the other group (Group B) now contains

        128 − k   heads.

3. While still blindfolded, flip every coin in Group A over (heads↔tails).

4. Count the heads after the flip:

   • Coins that were heads in Group A (there were k of them) have now become tails.  
   • Coins that were tails in Group A (there were 128 − k of them) have now become heads.

   Therefore the number of heads now in Group A is exactly

        128 − k.

5. Group B was never touched, so it still has 128 − k heads.  
   Hence both groups contain the same number of heads.

Nothing else about the total number of pennies matters, and no sight is required.

Final answer: Take any 128 coins to form the first pile, flip every coin in that pile, and leave the rest as the second pile; afterward each pile has the same number of heads-up coins (namely, 128 − k where k was the unknown original heads in the first pile).",True
104,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?
 Hint: Do casework on what Moe can have.",Do casework on what Moe can have.,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

Each of the five council members cast an aye or a nay vote for each of the five proposals, with no abstentions. Use the clues below to discover how each council member voted on each of the proposals.
1. Each proposal got a different number of aye votes (possibly zero).
2. All in all, there was one more aye vote than nay vote cast.
3. At no time did Quincy vote nay on two consecutive proposals.
4. Orlando, Penny and Sven voted the same way on the second proposal.

Quincy - aye, nay, aye, aye, nay
Rosina - nay, nay, aye, aye, nay
Sven - nay, aye, nay, aye, nay",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

 O = Orlando  P = Penny  Q = Quincy  R = Rosina  S = Sven  
 1 – 5 = the five proposals; “A” = aye, “N” = nay.

Step 1 – How many ayes did each proposal get?
• 25 votes are cast in all; there is exactly one more A than N (condition 2).  
 Hence total ayes = 13 and total nays = 12.

• Each proposal gets a different number of ayes (condition 1).  
 Five different numbers chosen from {0,1,2,3,4,5} must sum to 13.  
 0+1+3+4+5 = 13, so the five numbers of ayes are {0,1,3,4,5}; the number 2 is not used.

• Condition 7 says A₃ = A₂ + 1.  
 Within {0,1,3,4,5} the only pairs differing by 1 are (0,1), (3,4) and (4,5).  
 The pair (0,1) is impossible because of condition 6 (see below).  
 Pair (4,5) will contradict condition 6 (proved later).  
 Therefore (A₂ , A₃) = (3,4).

So far: A₁, A₄, A₅ = {0,1,5} in some order; A₂ = 3; A₃ = 4.

Step 2 – Work out proposal 2.
Condition 4: O₂ = P₂ = S₂ (call that common vote x).  
Since proposal 2 has exactly 3 ayes, and three people (O,P,S) vote the same way,
 they must all be A.  
Thus O₂ = P₂ = S₂ = A, leaving Q₂ = R₂ = N.

Step 3 – Use conditions 3 and 6 for Q and S on proposals 1-3.
• Q₂ = N, and Quincy may not have two consecutive N’s (condition 3),  
 so Q₁ = A and Q₃ = A.  
• Condition 6 says Q and S differ on each of proposals 1,2,3.  
 We already have Q₂ = N, S₂ = A (different).  
 Hence S₁ = N and S₃ = N.

Step 4 – Complete proposal 3.
Proposal 3 must have 4 ayes.  We already have Q₃ = A and S₃ = N,  
so O₃, P₃ and R₃ must all be A to reach four ayes.

Step 5 – Determine proposal 1.
Possible remaining aye-totals are 0,1,5.  
Proposal 1 already has Q₁ = A and S₁ = N.

• It cannot have 0 ayes (Q₁ is already A).  
• It cannot have 5 ayes (S₁ is N).  
Therefore A₁ = 1, and the only aye is Quincy.  
Thus O₁ = P₁ = R₁ = S₁ = N, Q₁ = A.

Step 6 – Decide proposals 4 and 5.
The two unused aye-totals are 0 and 5.  
Condition 5 says R₄ = A, so proposal 4 cannot have 0 ayes; therefore

 A₄ = 5 (all five councillors vote A)  
 A₅ = 0 (all five councillors vote N).

Step 7 – Check Quincy’s consecutive N’s.
His votes are A N A A N – no two N’s in a row, so condition 3 is satisfied.

Everything now satisfies all seven conditions, so the solution is unique.

111,"Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?
 Hint:  1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower."," 1:

So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – What both players can do  

•  Flower’s actions  
  P – start to produce poison;  
  N – do not produce poison.  

•  Dog’s actions  
  E – eat the flower;  
  S – stay away (do not eat).  

Step 2 – What each of them wants  

Flower:  
      best    = stay alive without having had to make poison  
      next best  = stay alive after having made poison  
      worst     = be eaten (die)  

Dog:  
      best    = survive (certainly)  
      next best  = 50 % chance of surviving (do not eat the flower)  
      worst     = certainly die (eat a poisoned flower)  

Step 3 – The information restriction  
The dog cannot see whether the flower is poisoned; the flower knows that the dog cannot see; the dog knows that the flower knows this, etc.  
Therefore the dog’s action cannot be conditioned on what the flower has actually done – it has to make one fixed decision, E or S.

Step 4 – The flower’s reasoning  
“If the dog chooses E there is only one way for me to stay alive: make poison (P).  
If the dog chooses S I do not need to make poison (N) and I even save myself the effort.  
Because I value ‘alive without poison’ more than ‘alive with poison’, I strictly prefer the world in which the dog chooses S to the world in which the dog chooses E.”

Conclusion for the flower:  
Whatever the precise pay-off numbers are, the flower is better off when the dog stays away, and if it ever foresees the dog’s eating it will certainly produce poison.

Step 5 – The dog’s reasoning  
The dog now asks itself: “What would the flower have done in my place?”  
•  If I decide to eat (E) the flower foresees this and, as just argued, will surely poison itself (P) to avoid being eaten. Then I die with probability 1.  
•  If I decide to stay away (S), the flower will do nothing (N) and I keep the 50 % chance of surviving that the doctor gave me.  

Because 50 % chance of living is strictly better than 0 % chance of living, rationality tells the dog to stay away.

Step 6 – Equilibrium description  

Dog: S (do not eat)  
Flower: N (no poison) – but it was ready to choose P instantly had the dog chosen E.  

No player can do better given the other’s move, and the reasoning is common knowledge, so this is the unique rational outcome.

Final answer: the dog will not eat the flower, because it foresees that if it were to try, the equally rational flower would certainly have produced poison, giving the dog a 0 % chance of survival; by staying away it at least keeps its original 50 % chance of living.",True

First names :  Isaac, Albert, Marie, Charles  
Surnames    :  Newtune, Eyeline, Curious, Darling

1 : Isaac / Newtune / Welder  
2 : Albert / Eyeline / Gardener  
3 : Marie / Curious / Cleaner  
4 : Charles / Darling / Bricklayer  

Clues  
(1) Albert is two places above the Bricklayer.  
(2) Darling is one place below Charles.  
(3) Curious is two places below the Welder.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Position of Albert and the Bricklayer
Albert must be in place 1 or 2 (otherwise “two places above” is impossible).

Case A : Albert in place 2 → Bricklayer in place 4  
Case B : Albert in place 1 → Bricklayer in place 3  

(We shall see that Case B leads to a contradiction; Case A works.)

-------------------------------------------------
CASE A  (Albert in place 2)

• First-name column: entry “Albert” at place 2 matches the magazine list, so all other first-name entries must be incorrect.  
  ⇒ Isaac ≠ 1, Marie ≠ 3, Charles ≠ 4.

• Because Isaac cannot be 1, place 1 is Charles or Marie.  
  Because Charles cannot be 4, Charles is 1 or 3 (but 4 forbidden already).  

• From clue (2): Darling is just below Charles.  
  – If Charles were at 3, Darling would be at 4, but clue (3) will force Curious to be at 4 (see below). Contradiction.  
  – Therefore Charles is at 1 and Darling at 2.

• Clue (1) has already fixed Bricklayer at 4.  
  In the occupation column the magazine’s only correct entry must therefore be at place 4 (Bricklayer); every other occupation entry must be wrong.  
  Hence place 1 cannot really be “Welder” (even though the magazine says so).

• Clue (3): Welder must be at place 2 (because place 1 cannot be Welder and places 3,4 are too low), so Curious is two below, at place 4.

• The remaining surnames Newtune and Eyeline go to places 1 and 3.  
  Exactly one surname must be correctly placed; only “Newtune at place 1” can satisfy that.  
  ⇒ place 1 surname = Newtune, place 3 surname = Eyeline.

• Remaining first names (Isaac, Marie) fill places 3 and 4.  
  Because place 3 cannot be “Marie” (magazine would be correct), we have  
  place 3 = Isaac, place 4 = Marie.

• Occupations still missing at places 1 and 3.  
  The unused jobs are Cleaner and Gardener.  
  The magazine shows Cleaner at 3, so we must avoid that (else two correct occupations).  
  ⇒ place 3 = Gardener, place 1 = Cleaner.

We now have

1 : Charles Newtune – Cleaner  
2 : Albert Darling – Welder  
3 : Isaac  Eyeline – Gardener  
4 : Marie  Curious – Bricklayer

All three clues and the “exactly one correct in each column” condition are satisfied.

-------------------------------------------------
CASE B  (Albert in place 1)

A systematic check (welder at 1 vs 2, positions of Curious, Darling, correctness counts in the occupation column, …) shows that no assignment can leave exactly one magazine entry correct in every column.  
Hence Case B is impossible.

-------------------------------------------------
The unique arrangement is therefore the one obtained in Case A.

     2T = 870 min – 20 min = 850 min  
     T  = 425 min = 7 h 05 min.

   So he left home at 7:05.

4. Time of arrival

   S = T + 20 min = 7 : 05 + 0 : 20 = 7 : 25.

Check:  
  Mirror image of 7 : 05 is 4 : 55, and 4 : 55 + 2 h 30 min = 7 : 25, exactly as required.

 Hint: nan",,"The first thing that you should notice is that all of the letters except V and Z appear.  Therefore each letter appears only on one block.  The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).

115,"Question: One day, 4 groups of people meet together to hold a meeting. There are 3 representatives from each group.
The groups are: KINGS, QUEENS, RELIGIOUS FIGURES and STOOGES.
Among the KINGS are: James, Saul and Henry.
Among the QUEENS are Victoria, Elizabeth and Candace.
The RELIGIOUS FIGURES consist of the Pope, Mother Teresa and Gandhi.
The STOOGES, of course, are none other than Moe, Larry and Curly.
The Stooges decide to play a game with the rest of the group. The game is called Untouchable. The Stooges start the game by tapping certain ones on the shoulder a specific number of times. The object of the game is for the other groups to figure out the pattern the Stooges set (that is, why they tap certain individuals a certain number of times), and to follow the pattern they set.
The only stipulation to the game is that people belonging to the RELIGIOUS FIGURES group do not tap anyone; however, they can be tapped.
The shoulder taps occur this way, starting with the Stooges (who originated the pattern):
Moe taps James, Gandhi, the Pope  and  Saul twice each.
Larry taps Henry, and Curly once each.
Curly taps Henry and Larry once each.
(The KINGS catch on and do the following):
James taps the Pope, Saul, Gandhi and Moe twice each.
Saul taps Gandhi, Moe and James and the Pope twice each.
Henry taps Larry and Curly once each.
(The QUEENS catch on and do the following):
Elizabeth and Victoria tap each other four times each.
Question:
Who are the untouchables?
 Hint: nan",,"The pattern set by the Stooges is that each one taps the person with the same number of vowels in their name, one tap for every vowel.
Queen Candace only has 3 Vowels, and Mother Teresa has 5. Neither of them have a counterpart with the same number of vowels. They would, therefore be the untouchables.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"To decide who the “untouchables’’ are we do not have to discover every subtlety of the pattern the Stooges invented; it is enough to record every single shoulder–tap that is actually made and then see which persons are never tapped at all.  
(The name of the game strongly hints that an “untouchable’’ is a person who is never touched.)

Step 1.  List every tap that is described in the problem.

•  Stooges’ opening moves  
  – Moe → James ×2, Gandhi ×2, Pope ×2, Saul ×2  
  – Larry → Henry ×1, Curly ×1  
  – Curly → Henry ×1, Larry ×1  

•  Kings’ replies  
  – James → Pope ×2, Saul ×2, Gandhi ×2, Moe ×2  
  – Saul  → Gandhi ×2, Moe ×2, James ×2, Pope ×2  
  – Henry → Larry ×1, Curly ×1  

•  Queens’ replies  
  – Elizabeth → Victoria ×4  
  – Victoria  → Elizabeth ×4  

Step 2.  Tally, for every person present, how many times he or she is touched (it makes no difference whether one tap or several taps are used – all we need to know is whether the number is zero or not).

Kings  
  James: 2 (from Moe) + 2 (from Saul) = 4 – touched  
  Saul : 2 (from Moe) + 2 (from James) = 4 – touched  
  Henry: 1 (from Larry) + 1 (from Curly) = 2 – touched  

Queens  
  Elizabeth: 4 (from Victoria) – touched  
  Victoria : 4 (from Elizabeth) – touched  
  Candace  : 0 – never touched  

Religious figures  
  Pope   : 2 (from Moe) + 2 (from James) + 2 (from Saul) = 6 – touched  
  Gandhi : 2 (from Moe) + 2 (from James) + 2 (from Saul) = 6 – touched  
  Mother Teresa: 0 – never touched  

Stooges  
  Moe  : 2 (from James) + 2 (from Saul) = 4 – touched  
  Larry: 1 (from Curly) + 1 (from Henry) = 2 – touched  
  Curly: 1 (from Larry) + 1 (from Henry) = 2 – touched  

Step 3.  Read off the names whose tally is zero.

Only two people are never tapped at all:

• Candace (one of the Queens)  
• Mother Teresa (one of the Religious Figures)

Therefore these two are the “untouchables’’ in the game.

Final answer: Candace and Mother Teresa",True
116,"Question: Four members of the Madadian pro-celebrity Kebab wrestling team took part in a charity pool match to raise money for new spandex sequined grease proof leotards
Al Gore-Rhythm, Annie Buddyhome, Dan Druff and Hayden Seek participated in the POOL competition.
FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?
 Hint: nan",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points
Therefore the conclusion is that Al Gore-Rhythm won with 29 points and Dan Druff came in second place with 22 points. Annie Buddyhome is third place with 21 points and last is Hayden Seek with 18 points.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

A = Al Gore-Rhythm  
N = Annie Buddyhome  
D = Dan Druff  
H = Hayden Seek  

For every head-to-head game 15 balls are potted, so the two scores in that game add to 15.

Let  

A_N = Al’s points vs Annie (so Annie scores 15 – A_N)  
A_D = Al’s points vs Dan (Dan scores 15 – A_D)  
A_H = Al’s points vs Hayden (Hayden scores 15 – A_H)  
N_D = Annie’s points vs Dan (Dan scores 15 – N_D)  
N_H = Annie’s points vs Hayden (Hayden scores 15 – N_H)  
D_H = Dan’s points vs Hayden (Hayden scores 15 – D_H)

Translate every “OUTCOME” into equations.

1.  Total_H = 18.  

2.  Total_A is odd.  

3.  D_H = (15 – D_H) + 5  → D_H = 10, Hayden 5.  

4.  |A_N – (15 – A_N)| = 1  → the game is 8–7 or 7–8.  

5.  A_D = 2 (15 – A_D) → 3 A_D = 30 → A_D = 10, Dan 5.  

6.  Hayden vs Al is one less than vs Dan → Hayden vs Al = 4, so A_H = 11.  

7.  Dan vs Annie = 7, so N_D = 8, Dan 7.

Now use totals.

Total_H = (15 – A_H) + (15 – N_H) + (15 – D_H)  
18 = 4 + (15 – N_H) + 5  
18 = 9 + (15 – N_H)  
(15 – N_H) = 9 → N_H = 6, Hayden 9.

So the only unknown game score remaining is A_N, which is either 8–7 or 7–8.

Compute totals in the two cases.

Case 1: A_N = 8 (Al 8, Annie 7)  
Total_A = 8 + 10 + 11 = 29 (odd✓)  
Total_N = 7 + 8 + 6 = 21  
Case 2: A_N = 7 (Al 7, Annie 8)  
Total_A = 7 + 10 + 11 = 28 (even ✗)  

Only Case 1 satisfies condition 2, so it is the actual result.

 Hint: nan",,"6210001000
There are 6 zeros, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the ten-digit number be 

d₀ d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉

where dᵢ is the digit in the (i+1)-st place and, by the statement of the problem,

dᵢ = (number of i’s among the ten digits) for i = 0,1,…,9.

Two immediate facts
1.  The sum of all counts must equal the number of positions:  
   d₀+d₁+…+d₉ = 10.                                                        (1)

2.  Let z = d₀ be the number of zeros.  
   Exactly 10–z positions then contain non–zero digits, so  
   (the number of non-zero dᵢ’s) = 10–z.                                   (2)

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – what values can the non-zero digits take?
Among the 10–z non-zero digits, one of them is d₀ = z.  
The other 9–z non-zero digits must add up to 10–z–z = 10–2z (from (1)).

If we let m be the number of 2’s among the digits and keep in mind that
all the other non-zero digits are 1’s (any 3 or larger would make the sum too big),
we get

( 9–z–m ones ) + ( m twos ) = 10–2z  
⇒ (9–z–m)·1 + 2m = 10–2z  
⇒ 9–z–m + 2m = 10–2z  
⇒ m + 9–z = 10–2z  
⇒ m = z – 1.

Because m must be a non-negative integer, z ≥ 1; because we cannot have more
than one ‘2’ (otherwise the digit “2” would appear more than once, forcing d₂ ≥ 2),
the only admissible values are

z = 2  or  z = 6.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – eliminate z = 2
If z = 2, then from (2) the number of non-zero digits is 8,
and from the computation above there must be exactly one ‘2’ and 6 ones.

Trying to place six 1’s quickly fails:  
d₁ would have to be 6, which introduces a single ‘6’, so d₆ = 1,
but then we already have the needed two 1’s and cannot create the other four
without contradicting the counts of 3,4,5,7,8,9.  
Hence z = 2 is impossible.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – take z = 6
Now d₀ = 6.  
Equation (2) says there are 10–6 = 4 non-zero digits.
From m = z – 1 we see there is exactly one ‘2’ and (8–z)=2 ones.

Put the mandatory digits down:

d₀ = 6                        (zero count)  
d₁ = 2                        (one count)  
d₂ = 1                        (two count)

We have one ‘1’ so far; we need exactly two.  
Place the second ‘1’ at position 6 (that is, set d₆ = 1).  
Now the digit ‘6’ appears once, so d₆ = 1 is consistent.

All remaining positions (3,4,5,7,8,9) must be 0 so that
no unwanted 3’s, 4’s, 5’s, 7’s, 8’s, or 9’s are introduced.
That also supplies the required six zeros.

Thus the complete digit list is

d₀ d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉  
6   2   1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0

------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 – verification
Digits of the constructed number: 6 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

Count of 0’s = 6 → d₀ = 6 ✓  
Count of 1’s = 2 → d₁ = 2 ✓  
Count of 2’s = 1 → d₂ = 1 ✓  
Count of 3’s = 0 → d₃ = 0 ✓  
Count of 4’s = 0 → d₄ = 0 ✓  
Count of 5’s = 0 → d₅ = 0 ✓  
Count of 6’s = 1 → d₆ = 1 ✓  
Count of 7’s,8’s,9’s = 0 → d₇=d₈=d₉=0 ✓

Everything matches, so the number is correct, and the solution is unique.

119,"Question: Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?
 Hint: nan",,"Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.  There are only six combinations that satisfy these conditions.  Namely, for (Snap, Crackle, Pop) they are:
(1, 7, 6)
(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.
And, as usual, Gretchen solidifies her place as a top student.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step by step

1.  Set up the variables  
   S = Snap’s number, C = Crackle’s number, P = Pop’s number,  
   all positive integers with  
   S + C + P = 14.

2.  Snap speaks  
   “I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.”  
   Snap can be certain of that only if it is IMPOSSIBLE for Crackle’s and Pop’s
   numbers to be equal.  
   They would be equal precisely when  

         C = P = (14 – S)/2 .            (†)

   This cannot occur iff 14 – S is odd.  
   Hence 14 – S is odd ⟹ S is odd.  
   Everyone now knows that Snap’s number S is odd.

3.  Crackle speaks  
   “I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.”  
   Before Snap spoke, Crackle knew only his own number C.

   • Could someone share his number?  
     If S = C (or P = C) then the third number would be 14 – 2C.  
     For that to be positive we would need 2C < 14 ⇒ C ≤ 6.  
     Therefore, for Crackle to rule this out with certainty, he must have  
     C ≥ 7.

   • Could Snap and Pop be equal?  
     That would require (†) with C fixed, i.e. 14 – C even.  
     Therefore Crackle can rule that out only when 14 – C is odd, i.e. C is odd.

   Combining the two conditions gives

         C ∈ {7, 9, 11, 13}.                    (1)

   Everyone now knows (1).

4.  Pop speaks  
   “Now I know what all three of our numbers are.”

   Pop knows P and also knows (1) and that S is odd.
   He lists all possible (S,C) with

         S + C = 14 – P,
         S odd,
         C ∈ {7, 9, 11, 13},
         S, C, P all different.

   Pop can succeed only if exactly one ordered pair survives that list.
   Work through P = 1,…,13:

         P = 1  ⇒ S + C = 13   → 0 solutions
         P = 2  ⇒ S + C = 12   → (5,7), (3,9), (1,11) … 3 solutions
         P = 3  ⇒ S + C = 11   → 0 solutions
         P = 4  ⇒ S + C = 10   → (3,7), (1,9) … 2 solutions
         P = 5  ⇒ S + C =  9   → 0 solutions
         P = 6  ⇒ S + C =  8   → only (1,7)                        ← unique
         P ≥ 7  ⇒ S + C ≤ 7 and C ≥ 7 … impossible.

   The only value of P that yields a unique possibility is

         P = 6,     S = 1,     C = 7.

   Hence Pop’s number is 6, Snap’s is 1, Crackle’s is 7.

5.  Gretchen’s conclusion  
   Everyone in the room has heard the same three remarks,
   so Gretchen can reproduce exactly the reasoning above.
   Only one consistent assignment exists, so she confidently states:

123,"Question: In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?
 Hint: nan",,"Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which ""on"" machine is now off and which ""off"" is now on (when we activate its switch).",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"All four saws are running when the brother is first taken into the room, so he has a chance to hear what each individual machine sounds like.  
He then walks out, closes the door, and works on the outside (back-up) switches by himself.  
The only thing he ever does is operate those switches; every bit of information he needs comes from the effect each operation has.

1. He turns the first outside switch off.  
 •  The machine fed through that switch immediately loses power and its noise stops.  
 •  Even through the closed door the difference is obvious: one of the four familiar noises has vanished.  
 •  From its sound he knows exactly which machine has stopped, so he writes that machine’s number on the first switch.

2. He turns the same switch on again; the noise of that machine returns.

3. He repeats the procedure with each of the remaining three outside switches in turn.  
 Each time he flips a switch off, the corresponding machine’s sound disappears and he labels the switch accordingly.

When he has tried all four switches he has a perfect one-to-one list:

 •  Switch that silenced machine A  →  controls machine A  
 •  Switch that silenced machine B  →  controls machine B  
 •  Switch that silenced machine C  →  controls machine C  
 •  Switch that silenced machine D  →  controls machine D

He then goes back into the room and announces the correct correspondence.

Final answer:  He simply flips each outside back-up switch off for a moment; the saw that stops betrays which machine that switch controls. By doing this one switch at a time he can label all four switches correctly and confirm the matching when he re-enters the room.",True
124,"Question: A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?
 Hint: If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second. The order white, blue, black, red is now revealed.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

R = painting the whole cube red,  
W = painting the white circles (front, left, right, bottom),  
Blu = painting the top, back and bottom blue,  
Bla = painting the front and back black.  

We have to arrange these four steps so that  

• the final appearance agrees with Fact 1,  
• Rules 2–4 about mixing are respected, and  
• exactly one statement in Fact 5 is true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  The back face is finally dark-blue (= blue + black).  
    By the hint, that can happen only if the blue coat was on the
    back before the black coat; hence

           Blu precedes Bla.                                  (A)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  The front face is finally black with a gray
    (= black + white) circle.

    • The circle must already be white when the black paint is
      applied so that it can mix immediately to gray; therefore

           W precedes Bla.                                    (B)

    • Outside the circle the front face ends up pure black, so
      no colour that mixes with black (such as red or blue)
      may be present there when black is applied.  
      The only way to guarantee this is to apply the red coat
      after the black one, because once black is present it
      cannot be changed (Rule 3):

           Bla precedes R.                                    (C)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Combine (A), (B) and (C):

           W  →  Blu  →  Bla  →  R

    i.e.   White  →  Blue  →  Black  →  Red.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Check the remaining faces.

    • Top: blue then red  ⇒ purple – correct.  
    • Bottom: white circle, then blue (light-blue circle),
      then red (outer part turns purple, circle cannot change) – correct.  
    • Left & Right: white circle, then red (pink circle, red background) – correct.  
    • Back: blue then black  ⇒ dark-blue, later red cannot change it – correct.

    All faces match Fact 1 and Rules 2–4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Verify Fact 5 (only one statement true).

    (i)  “Black was added first”     false (black is third).  
    (ii) “Red was added before blue”   false (red is last).  
    (iii)“Blue was added after white”   true  (blue is second, white first).  
    (iv) “White was added last”      false (white is first).

    Exactly one statement (iii) is true, as required.

Therefore the only possible order is

White  →  Blue  →  Black  →  Red.

125,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T
Y-Z
""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?
 Hint: Q cannot exist in the password without U.",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.
Writing each determined ""other"" letter in alphabetical order, and writing each ""password"" letter under its corresponding ""other"" letter, we get:
F H J K M O Q V W X
U P R E D  I  C A B L
The pairs S-T and Y-Z can each only be placed in one spot here:

126,"Question: The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.
4. Jeeper and the center signed with the Downers and the Typhoons, in some order.
5. Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order.
6. The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.
7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.
 Hint: nan",,"The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.

Winnie DePooh refuses to take part with Eve O'Looshun.
Zoltan Pepper refuses to take part with Brighton Early.
How many acceptable groups can the producer put together?
 Hint: nan",,"There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians. However, some of them are not acceptable, because they do not include both an actor and a singer. This brings the possible combinations down to 36. When you eliminate the combinations that represent people who refuse to work together, you end up with 9.The acceptable groups are:
1) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Howard Eyeno, and Brighton Early;
2) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Eve O'Looshun, and Brighton Early;
3) Holly Wood, Ty Tanick, Eve O'Looshun, and Brighton Early;

8) Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early;
9) Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early.
Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else. Winnie DePooh doesn't get a similar advantage by being the only director/singer because he refuses to work with Eve O'Looshun, which limits his availability.

128,"Question: One variation of the famous ""Eight Queens Puzzle"" is the ""Bishop Puzzle"".
We know that you can place up to 8 queens on a chessboard with no other pieces in such a fashion that no queen can be taken.  We also know that you can place 32 knights on the board in such a fashion that none can be taken.
Do you know how many bishops you can place on a standard 8x8 chessboard so that no piece can be taken?  What is their placement?
 Hint: nan",,"Fourteen bishops can be placed on the board.
There are a number of solutions for this problem, but the simplest is the following placement.
1) b8
2) c8
3) d8
4) e8
5) f8
6) g8
7) a1
8) b1
9) c1

(row , column) = (1…8 , 1…8).  
For a square (r , c)

 NW–SE diagonal has “difference’’ d = r – c ∈ {-7,…,7} (15 possibilities)  
 NE–SW diagonal has “sum’’    s = r + c ∈ {2,…,16} (15 possibilities)

Two bishops attack each other iff they share a diagonal, i.e. if they have either the
same d or the same s.  Therefore in a set of mutually non-attacking bishops every
bishop must have a unique difference and a unique sum.

Can we use all 15 differences and all 15 sums?  
No, because a square (r , c) exists for the pair (d , s) only when

 r = (s + d)/2 and c = (s – d)/2 are integers between 1 and 8.

That requires s and d to have the same parity (both even or both odd).  
Among the 15 differences there are 7 even and 8 odd values, while among the 15
sums there are 8 even and 7 odd values.  Hence at most

 min(7,8) + min(8,7) = 7 + 7 = 14

pairs (d , s) can be realised, so 14 is an upper bound.

A construction that reaches this bound (therefore optimal) is:

Row 1 : a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, h1  
Row 8 : b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8

In algebraic notation the 14 bishops are placed on

Thus no two bishops share a diagonal, and the total number is 14.

129,"Question: During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces
 Hint: Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.
The weights are powers of 3:  1 ounce, 3 ounces, 9 ounces, 27 ounces.
Example:
7 ounces – Plate A: 9 oz. and 1 oz. weights.   Plate B: 3 oz weight and gold
In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.
Thus, the number of valid combinations for n weights is (3^n – 1) / 2.
For four weights, (3^4 – 1) / 2 = (81 – 1) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We want a set of four positive integer weights that allows the assessor to weigh every whole-number amount of gold dust starting at 1 oz, when the weights may be put on either pan of a balance.  
Let the four weights be  

w₁ < w₂ < w₃ < w₄ .

Key observation:  
With a balance we can put a weight on the same pan as the gold (count it as “−”) or on the opposite pan (count it as “+”).  
Therefore an amount N of gold is weighable iff we can write  

N = ε₁w₁ + ε₂w₂ + ε₃w₃ + ε₄w₄ , where each εᵢ ∈ {−1,0,+1}.

So each weight is allowed three states (left pan, not used, right pan): this is exactly the “balanced ternary” representation.

To maximise the largest weighable amount while keeping every smaller integer possible as well, we proceed step-by-step.

1. The lightest weight must be 1 oz, otherwise 1 oz could not be weighed.  
   w₁ = 1.

2. Suppose we already have weights w₁,…,w_j whose total is S_j = w₁+…+w_j.  
   Using these, every amount from 1 up through S_j can be weighed.  
   To weigh the next amount, S_j + 1, the new weight w_{j+1} has to be small enough to let us correct the balance by using the older weights on either side.  
   The most we can offset with the old weights on the same pan as the gold is S_j, so the new weight may exceed S_j by at most S_j + 1:  
        w_{j+1} ≤ 2S_j + 1.

   To maximise the ultimate range we take the new weight as large as this permits:
        w_{j+1} = 2S_j + 1.

   This choice also makes the sequence grow as fast as possible while preserving the unbroken run of weighable integers.

Applying this rule four times:

• Start: S₀ = 0  
  w₁ = 2·0 + 1 = 1 → S₁ = 1

• Next: w₂ = 2·1 + 1 = 3 → S₂ = 1 + 3 = 4

• Next: w₃ = 2·4 + 1 = 9 → S₃ = 4 + 9 = 13

• Last: w₄ = 2·13 + 1 = 27 → S₄ = 13 + 27 = 40

Thus the optimal set of four weights is {1 oz, 3 oz, 9 oz, 27 oz}.  

Balanced-ternary theory tells us that with the weights 1,3,9,27 every positive integer up to 40 can indeed be expressed with coefficients −1,0,1, so every amount of gold from 1 oz through 40 oz is weighable. And 40 oz is the largest amount possible with any four weights, because our construction at each step already used the maximal allowable value.

Final answer: 40 ounces",True
130,"Question: Five young ladies (Liz, Marge, Sam, Ella and Jenny) went on five different hiking adventures. Each walked a distance of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 kilometers (random order).

and that the resulting four-letter word can be interpreted in two different ways to give a pair of English antonyms.

Step-by-step search

1. Only five possibilities exist for the first letter (L,E,P,W,T).  Many common 4-letter antonym pairs start with none of these (e.g. GOOD/EVIL, COLD/WARM, HIGH/LOW).  A natural pair that does start with allowed letters is EAST/WEST.

2. Check EAST:

   E (allowed for 6)  
   A (allowed for @)  
   S (allowed for &)  
   T (allowed for ^)

   So EAST fits 6@&^.

3. Check WEST:

   W (allowed for 6)  
   E (allowed for @)  
   S (allowed for &)  
   T (allowed for ^)

   WEST also fits 6@&^.

4. EAST and WEST are clear opposites (opposite directions).

5. No other common 4-letter antonym pair satisfies all four positional letter restrictions, so EAST/WEST is the unique solution.

132,"Question: Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?
 Hint: nan",,"If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10

Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:

Two of them received no letters; the remaining eight received letters three times each.

1.  Counting facts  
   • 6 working days × 4 deliveries each day = 24 individual deliveries.  
   • If eight houses get three deliveries each, 8 × 3 = 24, so the numbers work out.  

2.  Using the daily sums  
   Sum of the six daily totals = 18+12+23+19+32+25 = 129.  
   This is the sum of all house-numbers that were delivered to, counted with multiplicity.  
   If S is the sum of the eight occupied houses, then 3S = 129 ⇒ S = 43.  

3.  Finding the two missing houses

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.  Looking back at clue 2 gives you the answer for the last section.  She received more messages when cleaning her bedroom than when cleaning the den.  So she received 3 in the bedroom, and 2 in the den.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning

1. From clue 4, the kitchen was cleaned on Wednesday.  
   Day–Room so far: Wednesday → Kitchen.

2. Clue 2:  
      “Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.”  
   This gives a three-day chain:  
      (a) Day X: 1 message  
      (b) Day X + 1: Bathroom  
      (c) Day X + 2: Den  
   Trying the possible starts:
      • X = Monday ⇒ Tue = Bathroom, Wed = Den (but Wed is Kitchen) → impossible.  
      • X = Tuesday ⇒ Wed = Bathroom (but Wed is Kitchen) → impossible.  
      • X = Wednesday ⇒ Wed has 1 message, Thu = Bathroom, Fri = Den → works.

   So we have:  
      Wednesday: Kitchen, 1 message  
      Thursday: Bathroom  
      Friday: Den  

3. Rooms left: Bedroom and Living Room.  
   Days left: Monday and Tuesday.

4. Clue 1:  
      Thursday’s messages > Bedroom-day messages, but < Tuesday’s messages.  
   Therefore Bedroom is not on Tuesday (otherwise Bedroom-day = Tuesday and the inequality fails).  
   Hence:  
      Monday → Bedroom  
      Tuesday → Living Room  

5. Clue 3:  
      Messages on Bedroom-day (Monday) > messages on Den-day (Friday).

6. We now assign the remaining message numbers {2, 3, 4, 5} to Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri under the constraints:
      • Thursday > Monday (from clue 1)  
      • Thursday < Tuesday (from clue 1)  
      • Monday > Friday (from clue 3)

   A unique assignment satisfying all three is:
      Tuesday 5, Thursday 4, Monday 3, Friday 2.

7. Put everything together

   Monday   – Bedroom   – 3 messages  
   Tuesday  – Living Room – 5 messages  
   Wednesday – Kitchen  – 1 message  
   Thursday – Bathroom – 4 messages  
   Friday   – Den      – 2 messages  

All clues are satisfied.

Final answer:  
Monday – Bedroom – 3 messages  
Tuesday – Living Room – 5 messages  
Wednesday – Kitchen – 1 message  
Thursday – Bathroom – 4 messages  
Friday – Den – 2 messages",True
139,"Question: In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?
Given:
Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""
#4) Two consecutive chapters, in one order or the another, are ""I Kant Understand It"" and Joan's chapter (which isn't chapter four)

Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan

Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning

1.  From clue 3, Kiera’s chapter is three after “Freudian Slippers.”  
   Therefore “Freudian Slippers” can only be chapter 2 (→ Kiera = 5) or chapter 1 (→ Kiera = 4).

2.  Clue 1 says three consecutive chapters are  
        Sense of Hume-or  →  (Alex’s chapter)  →  Descartes Before DesHorse.  
    Thus Alex’s chapter cannot be 1 or 5, and one of the following number patterns must occur:  
        (Sense,Alex,Descartes) = (1,2,3) or (2,3,4) or (3,4,5).

--------------------------------------------------
Case A (“Freudian Slippers” = 1, Kiera = 4)

•  Try the three possible positions for the Sense/Alex/Descartes block.  
   – (Sense,Alex,Descartes) =(2,3,4) puts Alex at 3 and Descartes at 4, but Kiera is already 4 → OK so far, but it makes “Jung At Heart” chapter 5, which cannot be before Toby’s chapter (clue 2). Contradiction.  
   – The other two placements fail immediately.  
  ⇒ Case A impossible.

--------------------------------------------------
Case B (“Freudian Slippers” = 2, Kiera = 5)

Now place the Sense/Alex/Descartes block.

• (Sense,Alex,Descartes) =(1,2,3) is impossible because chapter 2 is already “Freudian Slippers.”  
• (Sense,Alex,Descartes) =(2,3,4) impossible for the same reason.  
• (Sense,Alex,Descartes) =(3,4,5) works:
        Chapter 3 … Sense of Hume-or  
        Chapter 4 … Alex’s chapter  
        Chapter 5 … Descartes Before DesHorse (and student Kiera).

Titles now used: Sense (3), Freudian (2), Descartes (5).  
Titles left: Jung, Kant.  
Students fixed so far: Alex (4), Kiera (5).

--------------------------------------------------
Placing the remaining titles

Only chapters 1 and 4 are untitled.  
• If “I Kant Understand It” were chapter 1, then by clue 4 Joan would have to be chapter 2 (adjacent), but that would put Joan on “Freudian Slippers,” leaving chapter 4 for “Jung.”  
  Then “Jung” would be chapter 4, but Toby has to be after “Jung” (clue 2) and the only chapter after 4 is 5 (Kiera). Impossible.  

So “I Kant Understand It” must be chapter 4, making “Jung At Heart” chapter 1.

--------------------------------------------------
Placing the remaining students

Current table

   Ch.1  Jung At Heart        ______
   Ch.2  Freudian Slippers    ______
   Ch.3  Sense of Hume-or     ______
   Ch.4  I Kant Understand It Alex
   Ch.5  Descartes…           Kiera

• Clue 4: “Kant” (chapter 4) must be adjacent to Joan’s chapter (not chapter 4).  
  The only adjacent chapters are 3 and 5; chapter 5 is Kiera, so Joan must be chapter 3.

• Clue 2: “Jung At Heart” (chapter 1) is before Toby’s chapter, so Toby cannot be chapter 1.  
  The only chapters left for students are 1 and 2 (Caleb, Toby). Hence Toby is chapter 2 and Caleb is chapter 1.

Chapter 1 – “Jung At Heart” – Caleb  
Chapter 2 – “Freudian Slippers” – Toby  
Chapter 3 – “Sense of Hume-or” – Joan

140,"Question: 8 friends decided to play in a pool tournament.  They played a single elimination tournament, with three rounds (the first round, second round, and finals).  Using the clues below can you determine who beat whom in each round?
Boys:  Jack, Jamie, Jim, Roger, Tommy
Girls:  Jessica, Renee, Tina
Clues:
1.  No one ever played against someone else with the same first name initial.
2.  The four people who advanced to the second round were Renee, the person who beat Tina in the first round, the loser of the final match, and the man who played Jessica in the first round.
3.  3 games of the first round, and 1 game of the second round were played by two people of the opposite sex.
4.  Jack only played against a man one time in the tournament, and Roger played against a man in every round he played in.
5.  Renee played against Jack at some point in the tournament.
6.  The two people who played in the final round were the winner, and the man who beat Tommy in the 2nd round.
7.  Jim always played against a man in the tournament.
8.  Jessica did not play against the eventual champion.
 Hint: nan",,"First Round:
Jack vs. Tina, Jack won
Jamie vs. Renee, Renee won
Jessica vs. Tommy, Tommy won
Jim vs. Roger, Roger won
Second Round:
Jack vs. Renee, Jack won
Tommy vs. Roger, Roger won
Finals:
Jack vs. Roger, Jack won",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us list the eight players, grouped by sex and first-initial.

Boys:  
Jack  (J)  
Jamie (J)  
Jim   (J)  
Roger (R)  
Tommy (T)

Girls:  
Jessica (J)  
Renee   (R)  
Tina    (T)

Because of clue 1 (“no one ever played someone else with the same first-name initial”) every game must be between players whose initials differ.

Step 1 – structure of the tournament  
• 1st round: 4 games (quarter-finals)  
• 2nd round: 2 games (semi-finals)  
• 3rd round: 1 game (final)

Step 2 – information that fixes the semi-finalists  
Clue 2 says the four semi-finalists are  
 Renee, the person who beat Tina, the loser of the final, and the man who played Jessica.

Clue 6 says Tommy is beaten in the 2nd round by a man who then reaches the final.  
Therefore Tommy himself must be a semi-finalist (he loses there), so Tommy has to be “the man who played Jessica in the first round”.  
Hence:

 man who played Jessica  =  Tommy  
 loser of the final      =  some man (call him L)  
 person who beat Tina    =  some player X (≠ Tina, initial ≠ T)

Thus the semi-finalists are
 Renee  Tommy  L  X.                             (1)

Step 3 – sex of the semi-final games (clue 3)  
Exactly one semi-final is mixed-sex; the other is same-sex.  
Tommy (M) must play the man who will beat him (L) ⇒ one semi-final is M vs M.  
Therefore the other semi-final (X vs Renee) must be the mixed-sex one, so X is a man.

So, at this point  
 L = male  X = male  Tommy = male  Renee = female.                         (2)

Step 4 – arranging the quarter-finals so that clue 3 (three mixed games) can hold  
Because there are only three women, all of them must play men in the 1st round and those three games are the mixed ones.  
Hence the single same-sex game in the 1st round must be the remaining match, a boy vs boy game.

Put the mixed games like this (winners shown first):

 • Tommy defeats Jessica  
 • Jack  defeats Tina  
 • Renee defeats Jamie

That leaves Jim and Roger to meet in the only same-sex quarter-final.

Thus the four 1st-round winners are  
 Tommy, Jack, Renee, Roger.                                       (3)

Step 5 – linking everything with the clues

a)  Jack only plays a man once (clue 4).  
    He has already faced Tina (F). To satisfy the clue he must also face one more female (Renee) and finally one man (the final). So Jack must reach the final.

b)  Renee must play Jack somewhere (clue 5). The only place left is the semi-final, so Jack and Renee meet there.

c)  Roger must play a man in every round he plays (clue 4).  
    Roger’s quarter-final opponent is Jim (M).  
    If Roger wins, his semi-final opponent is Tommy (M).  
    If he then reaches the final, he will meet Jack (M).  
    All of Roger’s opponents are male – the clue is satisfied.

d)  Jim always plays a man (clue 7). Jim’s only game is the quarter-final versus Roger (M). OK.

e)  Jessica does not meet the champion (clue 8). She lost to Tommy, not to Jack. OK.

Step 6 – resolving winners to meet every remaining condition

•  Quarter-finals  
   – Roger defeats Jim               (boy–boy)  
   – Tommy defeats Jessica           (mixed)  
   – Jack defeats Tina               (mixed)  
   – Renee defeats Jamie             (mixed)

•  Semi-finals  
   Bracketed so that the two boy winners (Roger and Tommy) meet, and the other two (Jack and Renee) meet:  
   – Roger defeats Tommy             (boy–boy)   → Roger goes to the final (and is “the man who beat Tommy”).  
   – Jack defeats Renee              (mixed)

•  Final  
   – Jack defeats Roger

Now check all clues once more:

1. Same-initial restriction holds for every pairing (J vs R, J vs T, etc.).  
2. Semi-finalists are Renee, Jack (beat Tina), Roger (lost final), Tommy (played Jessica).  
3. 1st round: 3 mixed, 1 boy-boy; 2nd round: exactly 1 mixed (Jack–Renee).  
4. Jack’s only male opponent is Roger (final). Roger’s opponents are Jim, Tommy, Jack – all men.  
5. Renee indeed plays Jack (semi-final).  
6. Finalists are the winner Jack and Roger, the man who beat Tommy in the 2nd round.  
7. Jim’s only opponent is Roger (a man).  
8. Jessica never plays Jack.

Everything is satisfied.

Therefore the entire tournament ran as follows.

First round (quarter-finals)  
 Tommy defeated Jessica.  
 Roger defeated Jim.  
 Jack defeated Tina.  
 Renee defeated Jamie.

Second round (semi-finals)  
 Roger defeated Tommy.  
 Jack defeated Renee.

Final  
 Jack defeated Roger.

Final answer:  
Quarter-finals – Tommy > Jessica, Roger > Jim, Jack > Tina, Renee > Jamie  
Semi-finals    – Roger > Tommy, Jack > Renee  
Final          – Jack > Roger",True
141,"Question: Ace, Callie, Draco, Emma, Eric, Holly, Leah, Misty, Quinn, and Xander play in a 5 team tournament of five colors: Red, Green, Blue, Black, & White.
There were no ties and the following statements were made:
Ace: Xander's team, Misty's team, The team that placed first, The team that placed 3rd and the green team are all different.
Callie: I placed second & I beat the green team & Emma (who are different).
Draco: Callie, Emma, & Misty are all on different teams.
Emma: Ace, Draco, and Callie all placed better than me.
Eric: The green team beat the blue team within 2.
Holly: The white team placed 3rd. I wasn't on the white team, but Leah was.
Leah: I beat Eric, lost to Callie, and was on the same team as Emma. The white and red teams were in the top 3.
Misty: I was 1 place ahead of the red team & placed 2nd
Quinn: I placed 4th. The blue team is 2nd.
Xander: Red & Callie beat black
But be warned, the 2 players who got in last place are lying!
 Hint: nan",,"1st - Red Team - Ace & Draco
2nd - Blue Team - Xander & Callie
3rd - White Team - Emma & Leah
4th - Green Team - Holly & Quinn
5th - Black Team - Eric & Misty",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

• 1 means 1st place (best), 5 means 5th (last).  
• Each of the 5 colours – Red, Green, Blue, White and Black – is a team with two players.  
• The two players on the last-place team are the only liars; everyone else tells the truth.

Step 1 – Start from statements that fix exact facts  
Callie (truth-teller) : “I placed second.” ⇒ Callie’s team = 2nd.  
Quinn (if truthful) : “I placed 4th.  The blue team is 2nd.”  
Eric (if truthful) : “Green beat Blue.”  This directly contradicts Quinn’s “Blue is 2nd”, so Quinn and Eric cannot both be truthful.  Because liars come in pairs on the same team, the clean way out is to let Eric be one liar and to look for a partner for him.  Keep Quinn truthful so we can use his hard information:

 Blue team = 2nd, Quinn = 4th.

Thus Callie is on the Blue team.

Step 2 – Choose the second liar  
Misty claims “I placed 2nd … and was one place ahead of Red.”  
But Blue is already 2nd and Draco later insists that Callie, Emma and Misty are on different teams; hence Misty’s whole statement cannot be true.  
Make Misty the other liar and put her on the same team as Eric.   
Therefore Eric and Misty share the 5th-place team, which must be a colour still free.  Call that team Black for the moment.

So, for the moment we have

Blue 2nd : Callie, (partner unknown)  
Black 5th : Eric (liar), Misty (liar)  
Quinn 4th : on some colour not yet fixed.

Step 3 – Work with the truthful statements

Holly (truthful) : “The white team placed 3rd.  I’m not on it, Leah is.”  
⇒ White 3rd, Leah on White, Holly not on White.

Leah (truthful) :  
• “I was on the same team as Emma” ⇒ Emma also on White.  
• “I lost to Callie” ⇒ Callie’s Blue (2nd) beats Leah’s White (3rd) – consistent.  
• “White and Red teams were in the top 3.”  Since White is 3rd and Blue is 2nd, Red must be 1st.

Thus we have

Red 1st, Blue 2nd, White 3rd, … , Black 5th.

Step 4 – Fix the remaining colour – Green must be 4th
The only colour not yet used is Green, so Green takes the remaining place 4.  
Quinn already said he is 4th, so Quinn is on Green.  
Holly is not on White, so she can be the second Green player.

So far

Red 1st :   ?, ?  
Blue 2nd :  Callie, ?  
White 3rd : Emma, Leah  
Green 4th : Quinn, Holly  
Black 5th : Eric*, Misty*            (* = liars)

Step 5 – Use Emma’s and Draco’s statements

Emma (truthful) : “Ace, Draco and Callie all placed better than me.”  
Emma is 3rd, so Ace and Draco must be on a team that is 1st or 2nd.  
Blue already has Callie and can hold only two players, so Ace and Draco cannot both join Blue.  
Therefore Ace and Draco must be the two players on the only other top-3 team with two empty seats, namely Red 1st.

Draco (truthful) now checks: Callie (Blue), Emma (White) and Misty (Black) are indeed all on different teams.

Step 6 – Fix the remaining open seat

Blue has Callie; it still needs one player.  
Ace’s statement will settle this.

Ace (truthful) :  
“Xander’s team, Misty’s team, the 1st-place team, the 3rd-place team and the Green team are all different.”  
Translated: the five teams  
Xander-team, Black, Red, White, Green are all distinct.  
Red, White, Green and Black are already different, so Xander’s team must be the only colour not in that list: Blue.  

Hence Xander is Callie’s team-mate on Blue.

Step 7 – Verify every truthful statement

• Ace: teams listed are Blue, Black, Red, White, Green – all different ✔  
• Callie: Blue 2nd, beats Green (4th) and White (3rd) ✔  
• Draco: Callie(Blue), Emma(White), Misty(Black) different ✔  
• Emma: Ace(1st), Draco(1st) and Callie(2nd) all beat her (3rd) ✔  
• Holly: White 3rd; Leah on White; Holly not ✔  
• Leah: beat Eric (Black 5th), lost to Callie (Blue 2nd), same team as Emma, and Red & White in top-3 ✔  
• Quinn: 4th and Blue is 2nd ✔  
• Xander: Red and Callie (Blue) both beat Black ✔  
• Misty & Eric are liars – their statements are indeed false.

Everything is consistent.

  1  MAGIC  {M A G I C} ─────────────── 2
  2  YEARN  {Y E A R N} ─────────────── 2
  3  BLAME  {B L A M E} ─────────────── 2
  4  GRABS  {G R A B S} ─────────────── 2
  5  KARMA  {K A R M}  ──────────────── 2
  6  BREAK  {B R E A K} ─────────────── 3

The hint says the second letter of MAGIC, i.e. A, is in the secret word, so

  A ∈ S .                                                          (1)

Because |S∩BREAK|=3 and A∈BREAK, S must contain exactly two more letters from
{B,R,E,K}.  We analyse the six possible pairs two at a time:

• Pair {B,R}:  S would share A,B,R with GRABS → 3 letters (needs 2) ⇒ reject.  
• Pair {B,E}:  S would share A,B,E with BLAME → 3 letters ⇒ reject.  
• Pair {R,E}:  S would share A,R,E with YEARN → 3 letters ⇒ reject.  
• Pair {R,K}:  S would share A,R,K with KARMA → 3 letters ⇒ reject.  
• Pair {E,K}:  still possible.  
• Pair {B,K}:  still possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 1   (A, E, K) are the BREAK letters in S
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Present totals so far

  MAGIC 1 (A)   YEARN 2 (A,E)  BLAME 2 (A,E)  GRABS 1 (A)  KARMA 2 (A,K)

To reach the required counts we must
  – add one (and only one) of {M,G,I,C} for MAGIC,
  – add one (and only one) of {G,R,B,S} for GRABS,
  – avoid every other listed letter.
Choosing G fulfils both first and second bullet at once:

  S = {A, E, K, G, ?}

All six requirements are now met; the fifth letter just has to be a letter
that is in none of the clue words.  Although this produces many technical
solutions, it is hard to obtain a familiar English 5-letter word.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 2   (A, B, K) are the BREAK letters in S
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Present totals so far

  MAGIC 1 (A)   YEARN 1 (A)   BLAME 2 (A,B)   GRABS 2 (A,B)   KARMA 2 (A,K)

We still need
  – one more MAGIC letter (choose C or I; M is impossible because it would
    raise BLAME to 3),
  – one more YEARN letter (choose Y or N; R,E would spoil other counts),
  – nothing that adds to the other intersections.

Pick C (for MAGIC) and Y (for YEARN):

  S = {A, B, C, K, Y}

Now check all counts:

  MAGIC  {M A G I C}: A,C  → 2          KARMA  {K A R M}: A,K  → 2
  YEARN  {Y E A R N}: A,Y  → 2          BLAME  {B L A M E}: A,B → 2
  GRABS  {G R A B S}: A,B  → 2          BREAK  {B R E A K}: A,B,K → 3

All six conditions are satisfied.

The five letters A-B-C-K-Y can be arranged to make the recognised
(especially in British English) 5-letter word

  B A C K Y   (slang for tobacco).

Since every requirement is met, “BACKY” is the unique ordinary word solution.

Final answer: BACKY",True
143,"Question: A particular inn always offers the same nine dishes on its dinner menu: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I. Five foreigners arrive. Nobody tells them which dish corresponds to each letter and so they each select one letter without knowing what they will eat. The innkeeper arrives with the five dishes ordered and puts them in the center of the table so that they can decide who eats what. This goes on for two more nights. The foreigners, who are professors of logic, were able to deduce by the dishes they ordered which letter represents what dish. What could have been the dishes ordered each of the three nights? Note: Each dish was ordered at least once.
 Hint: nan",,"They could have ordered ABCDD their first night (finding out what D is), AEFGG the second night (finding out what G is and what A is, since they had ordered it the previous night too), and BEHII the third night (finding out what I, B and E are). This leaves C, F and H out, and since they had never ordered these dishes twice, and each came out on a different night, they should know what they are.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

c₁(L) = number of times letter L is ordered on the first night,  
c₂(L) = number of times letter L is ordered on the second night,  
c₃(L) = number of times letter L is ordered on the third night.  

If two different letters had the same triple (c₁,c₂,c₃) they would always appear together the same number of times in every night, so after seeing the food there would be no way to distinguish which of the two dishes corresponded to which letter.  
Therefore the foreigners will be able to identify every letter only if all nine letters have different triples (c₁,c₂,c₃).

Since exactly five orders are placed each night, we need  

Σ c₁(L)=5, Σ c₂(L)=5, Σ c₃(L)=5.

Here is one convenient choice that satisfies these conditions and gives nine different triples:

           c₁  c₂  c₃
A :         1   0   0
B :         0   1   0
C :         0   0   1
D :         1   1   0
E :         1   0   1
F :         0   1   1
G :         2   0   0
H :         0   2   0
I :         0   0   2

Translating these triples into actual orders gives

Night 1 (A total of five letters): A D E G G  
Night 2 (five letters): B D F H H  
Night 3 (five letters): C E F I I

How the deduction works  
• At the end of the three nights the diners list, for every visible dish, the triple  
     (# times it appeared on night 1, night 2, night 3).  
• They also know, for every letter, the triple (c₁,c₂,c₃) from their own ordering record.  
• Because every letter has a different triple, each recorded dish-triple matches exactly one letter-triple, so the mapping from letters to dishes is forced and therefore uniquely determined.

All nine dishes (A through I) are ordered at least once, and after the third night the professors of logic can identify every dish beyond doubt.

Final answer:  
Night 1 orders – A, D, E, G, G  
Night 2 orders – B, D, F, H, H  
Night 3 orders – C, E, F, I, I",True
144,"Question: When Chidam got his first car, the first thing he had to do was to get a license plate. When he got his plate, he noticed that the plate had a peculiar number with five digits on it. He also noticed that the numbers could be read upside down, but the value of the number had increased by 78633.
Can you help Chidam find the number of his license plate number?
 Hint: There are only 5 digits from 0 to 9 which can be read upside down. The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","There are only 5 digits from 0 to 9 which can be read upside down. The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","The number of Chidam's license plate is 10968, which is 89601 when inverted.  That is 78633 more than the original number.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

N =  d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ (the original 5-digit plate)  
U =  f(d₅) f(d₄) f(d₃) f(d₂) f(d₁) (the number seen after turning the plate upside-down)

where f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(6)=9, f(8)=8, f(9)=6.  
Reading the plate upside-down increases the value by 78 633, so

U  –  N = 78 633.                                            (1)

Because U is still a 5-digit number, N must satisfy  
N ≤ 99 999 − 78 633 = 21 366.  
Hence N is between 10 000 and 21 366, so its first digit is 1:

d₁ = 1 and f(d₁)=1.                                        (2)

(1) written in positional notation is

10000·f(d₅)+1000·f(d₄)+100·f(d₃)+10·f(d₂)+f(d₁)  
−(10000·1     +1000·d₂ +100·d₃ +10·d₄ +d₅) = 78 633.      (3)

Separate the first- and last-digit terms.

Case 1 f(d₅)=8  (the upside-down number begins with 8)  
This happens when d₅ = 8, and forces N ≤ 11 366 (so the first digit really is 8 after the flip).

Insert d₁=1 and d₅=8 in (3):

70000 +1000(f(d₄)−d₂)+100(f(d₃)−d₃)+10(f(d₂)−d₄)−7 = 78 633  
⟺ 1000X +100Y +10Z = 8 640,                                (4)

where  
X = f(d₄)−d₂, Y = f(d₃)−d₃, Z = f(d₂)−d₄.

Divide (4) by 10:

100X +10Y + Z = 864.                                        (5)

Since each digit difference is at most 9 in magnitude, X must be 8 or 9.  
• X = 8 ⇒ 10Y+Z = 64, impossible because Y = f(d₃)−d₃ can only be 0, ±3.  
• X = 9 ⇒ 10Y+Z = −36.  Choose Y = −3 and Z = −6.

The choices

Y = −3 ⇔ d₃ = 9 (because f(9)−9 = 6−9 = −3)  
Z = −6 ⇔ d₄ = 6 and d₂ = 0 (because f(0)−6 = 0−6 = −6, and f(6)=9)

give a consistent set of digits:

d₁=1,  d₂=0,  d₃=9,  d₄=6,  d₅=8.

Hence N = 10 968, U = 89 601, and U−N = 89 601−10 968 = 78 633.

Case 2 f(d₅)=9  (which would require d₅ = 6)  
Substituting d₅=6 in (3) leads to the equation  

1000X +100Y +10Z = −1 362,

whose right–hand side is not a multiple of 10, impossible for the left side.  
Therefore this case has no solution.

Thus the only possible licence-plate number is 10 968.

145,"Question: You have 2 fuses. One fuse burns for 1 hour, the other burns for 2 hours. The problem is that the fuses burn irregular. The last few inches may burn longer than first few inches. Using the 2 fuses how can you create a fuse that burns for exactly 45 minutes. Remember, cutting them does no good since you don't know how long the cut fuse lasts.
 Hint: nan",,"You burn both sides of the 1 hour fuse and 1 side of the 2 hour fuse at the same time. Regardless of the varying speeds of the one hour fuse, when it goes out it has been 30 minutes. At that point there would be 1 hour and 30 minutes left on the 2 hour fuse. You then light the other end of the 2 hour fuse and since the burning time would be cut in half the fuse would be 45 minutes long.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – get a reliable 30-minute signal  
Light the 1-hour fuse at both of its ends.  
Because both ends are burning toward one another, the whole fuse will be consumed in exactly half of its normal time – 30 minutes – no matter how irregularly it burns.

Step 2 – start the 2-hour fuse at the same moment  
At the same instant you light the 1-hour fuse, light ONE end of the 2-hour fuse.  
After the first 30 minutes (when the 1-hour fuse has finished) the 2-hour fuse has been burning from one end for 30 minutes, so it still has 2 h − 30 min = 90 min of burning time left if it continued to burn from one end only.

Step 3 – turn the remaining 90-minute fuse into a 45-minute fuse  
The moment the 1-hour fuse goes out, immediately light the OTHER end of the 2-hour fuse.  
The unburned portion of that fuse (which is equivalent to 90 minutes of one-ended burning) is now burning from both ends, so it will be consumed in exactly half of 90 minutes:

90 min ÷ 2 = 45 min.

Step 4 – use that interval  
From the instant you ignite the second end of the 2-hour fuse to the moment the two flames meet, precisely 45 minutes will pass.  
Thus you have created a “fuse” that measures exactly 45 minutes.

Final answer: Light both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse. When the 1-hour fuse finishes (after 30 min), immediately light the free end of the 2-hour fuse; the remaining fuse will now burn out in exactly 45 minutes.",True
146,"Question: Mad Ade is telling his friend, Shamus O'Stoatclencher, at which number house he lives at on ""Madadia Avenue"":
(1) If my house number is a multiple of 3, then it is a number from 50 through 59.
(2) If my house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69.
(3) If my house number is not a multiple of 6, then it is a number from 70 through 79.""
What is Mad Ade's house number?
 Hint: nan",,"Mad Ade's house number is 76.
From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let H be Mad Ade’s house number.  
We must satisfy all three implications

(1)  H is a multiple of 3  ⇒  50 ≤ H ≤ 59  
(2)  H is NOT a multiple of 4  ⇒  60 ≤ H ≤ 69  
(3)  H is NOT a multiple of 6  ⇒  70 ≤ H ≤ 79  

For an implication “if P then Q’’ to be true, the only forbidden situation is P true and Q false.  
So for each statement we list what is forbidden:

• (1) forbids any multiple of 3 that is not between 50 and 59.  
  ⇒ Outside 50–59, H must NOT be a multiple of 3.

• (2) forbids any number that is not a multiple of 4 and is not in 60–69.  
  ⇒ Outside 60–69, H must be a multiple of 4.

• (3) forbids any number that is not a multiple of 6 and is not in 70–79.  
  ⇒ Outside 70–79, H must be a multiple of 6.

First note that numbers below 50 or above 79 are impossible:  
outside 50–79 we would need H not multiple of 3 but simultaneously multiples of both 4 and 6, which is impossible (a multiple of 6 is automatically a multiple of 3).  
Hence 50 ≤ H ≤ 79.

Case 1: 50 ≤ H ≤ 59  
Then H must be both a multiple of 4 (rule 2) and a multiple of 6 (rule 3), hence a multiple of 12.  
No multiple of 12 lies in 50–59, so this case is impossible.

Case 2: 60 ≤ H ≤ 69  
Rule 1 requires H not to be a multiple of 3, while rule 3 (since we are outside 70–79) demands H be a multiple of 6, contradicting rule 1.  
Thus impossible.

Case 3: 70 ≤ H ≤ 79  
Rule 1 again says H must not be a multiple of 3.  
Rule 2 (outside 60–69) says H must be a multiple of 4.  
So we need numbers in 70–79 that are multiples of 4 but not of 3: 72 and 76 are multiples of 4, but 72 is also a multiple of 3, leaving only 76.

Verification for H = 76:
(1) 76 is not a multiple of 3 → antecedent false, statement true.  
(2) 76 is a multiple of 4 → antecedent false, statement true.  
(3) 76 is not a multiple of 6 and lies in 70–79 → antecedent true, consequent true.  

All three statements hold, so 76 is the unique possible house number.

148,"Question: There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
 Hint: nan",,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.

4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.

From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:

     ⇒ They must use the only equal–degree pairs: {A,C} (degree 2) or {D,E} (degree 3).  
     ⇒ Neither of them can be in B (the only degree-4 room).

(2) Lead’s room and the lead’s parent’s room have the same size.

(3) Rooms of H and D must NOT border.

(4) Every room must border at least one man’s room and at least one woman’s room.

Because only two pairs of siblings exist in the cast, the lead must be one of  
{H, S, So, D}.  (Mother has no sibling in the company.)

────────────────────────────────────────
I.  Suppose H were the lead (sibling = S).

• Place H and S in {A,C} or {D,E}.  
• Check every sub-case against (2), (3) and (4).  
  – For {A,C}: either Daughter must border H (forbidden by (3)) or room A has no male neighbour (violates (4)).  
  – For {D,E}: every possibility forces some room to border only one sex (violates (4)).  
Hence H cannot be the lead.

────────────────────────────────────────
II.  Suppose the lead is So (sibling = D).

• Put So and D in {A,C} or {D,E}.  
• Requirement (2) ties So’s room-size to that of his parent H;  
  requirement (3) forbids H from bordering D.  
• Exhausting the sub-cases shows that one of those two conditions always fails.  
So So cannot be the lead.

────────────────────────────────────────
III.  Suppose the lead is D (sibling = So).

• Again put D and So in {A,C} or {D,E}.  
• (2) ties D’s room size to H’s, and (3) forbids her from bordering H.  
• Every arrangement violates either (3) or (4).  
Therefore D cannot be the lead.

────────────────────────────────────────
IV.  The remaining possible lead is S (sibling = H).

Try the two degree-matching pairs.

A.  Pair {A,C} with S in A, H in C  
    (S small, so Mother must also be small ⇒ Mother in D).  

    Rooms obtained:  
    A S(f) B So(m) C H(m) D M(f) E D(f)  

    – H’s room C is not adjacent to Daughter’s room E → (3) OK.  
    – Every room borders at least one male (H or So) and one female → (4) OK.  
    – S and H each border 2 rooms → (1) OK.  
    – S’s room (small) matches her parent’s (Mother’s) room size → (2) OK.  

    All rules satisfied.

B.  Pair {D,E} with S in E, H in D  
    (S large, so Mother large ⇒ Mother in C).  

    Rooms obtained:  
    A D(f) B So(m) C M(f) D H(m) E S(f)  

    All four rules again check out.  

Thus every legal solution makes S the lead; other occupants may swap within those two solutions, but the identity of the lead is fixed.

Hence the lead actor must be Hans Ernest Froopaloop, Jr.’s sister.

150,"Question: There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?
 Hint: There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We analyse the problem exactly as the hints suggest – by complete induction on the number N of lions surrounding a single sheep.

Definitions and preference rule  
• “Eat-and-turn” : when a lion eats the sheep he immediately turns into a sheep.  
• Every lion would rather remain an immortal grass-eating lion than risk becoming a sheep that can later be eaten.  
• Lions are perfectly logical and all know that all the others are perfectly logical.

Induction basis: N = 1  
With only one lion there is nobody left to eat him after he turns into a sheep, so the single lion safely eats the sheep.  
Conclusion : for N = 1 (an odd number) the sheep is eaten.

Induction step  
Induction hypothesis (IH):  for some k ≥ 1, when there are k lions and one sheep,  
  • if k is odd, the sheep is eaten,  
  • if k is even, the sheep is not eaten.

We now consider the situation with k+1 lions.

Case 1 – k+1 is odd.  
If the first lion (call him L₁) eats the sheep, he turns into a sheep and k lions remain.  
k = (k+1) – 1 is even.  
By IH, with an even number of lions the (new) sheep will not be eaten.  
Therefore L₁ is perfectly safe, gains a good meal, and strictly prefers eating to eternal grass.  
Because every lion reasons identically and knows L₁ is the closest and will therefore act first, all accept that the sheep will be eaten.  
Hence for odd (k+1) the sheep is eaten.

Case 2 – k+1 is even.  
Again let L₁ contemplate eating.  If he does, he becomes a sheep surrounded by k lions, where k = (k+1) – 1 is now odd.  
By IH, with an odd number of lions the single sheep definitely gets eaten.  
Thus L₁ would be sacrificing himself.  Preferring life on grass to certain death, he will not eat.  
Every other lion carries out the same logic and also refrains.  
Hence for even (k+1) the sheep survives.

This completes the induction:  

• odd number of lions  ⇒  sheep is eaten.  
• even number of lions ⇒  sheep survives.

Application to the original problem  
There are N = 100 lions, an even number.  Therefore every lion refrains from eating, and the lone sheep enjoys a perfectly safe, grass-filled life.

Final answer: The sheep will NOT be eaten; with 100 (even) lions no lion dares to eat it.",True
151,"Question: During a recent plane and train spotting contest, five eager entrants were lined up ready to be tested on their spotting ability. They had each spotted a number of planes (26, 86, 123, 174, 250) and a number of trains (5, 42, 45, 98, 105). From the clues below, can you determine what colour shirt each was wearing, their position, their age (21, 23, 31, 36, 40) and the number of trains and planes spotted?
1. Bob spotted 44 less trains than planes.
2. Tom was 36 years old.
3. The person on the far right was 8 years younger than Bob, and spotted 174 planes.
4. Josh was wearing a yellow shirt and spotted 37 trains fewer than Bob.
5. The person who was wearing a green shirt, was 19 years younger than the person to his left.
6. Steven spotted 105 trains and 250 planes.
7. The person in the centre was 31 years old, was wearing a blue shirt and spotted 42 trains.
8. Doug, who was on the far left, spotted 26 planes, and spotted 72 trains more than planes.
9. The person who was wearing a red shirt was 4 years older than Tom and was not next to the person wearing a blue shirt.
10.The person who was next to the 31 year old, but not next to the person who spotted 26 planes, was wearing a orange shirt, and spotted 45 trains.
 Hint: nan",,"example:

3 Bob(blue shirt)31,86,42
4 Tom(orange shirt)36,123,45
5 Josh(yellow shirt)23,174,5",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning step by step

1.  From clue 8  
   – Doug is on the far left (position 1).  
   – He spotted 26 planes and 72 more trains than planes ⇒ 98 trains.

2.  From clue 7  
   – The centre person (position 3) is 31 years old, wears a blue shirt and spotted 42 trains.

3.  From clue 3  
   – The far–right person (position 5) spotted 174 planes and is 8 years younger than Bob.

4.  From clue 6  
   – Steven spotted 250 planes and 105 trains.

5.  Trains so far: 98 (pos1), 42 (pos3), 105, 45, 5.  
    Planes so far: 26 (pos1), 174 (pos5), 250, 86, 123.

6.  From clue 10  
    – Among the two neighbours of the 31-year-old (positions 2 & 4), the one who is not next to the 26-plane spotter is position 4.  
    – Therefore position 4 wears an orange shirt and spotted 45 trains.

7.  Hence trains list becomes: pos1 98, pos3 42, pos4 45, leaving 105 & 5 for positions 2 and 5.

8.  Steven (105 trains) cannot be on the far right (that has only 5 trains), so Steven is position 2, with 250 planes.

9.  Remaining trains: 5 trains must be at position 5.

10. From clue 5 (green 19 years younger than the person to his left)  
    – The only age gap of 19 available is 40→21.  
    – Therefore the 40-year-old is at position 1 and wears red, the 21-year-old with a green shirt is at position 2.  
    – Thus Doug (pos1) is 40 yrs & red, Steven (pos2) is 21 yrs & green.

11. Ages left: 23, 31, 36.  The 31-year-old is already centre (pos3).

12. Clue 9: the red-shirt wearer (Doug) is 4 years older than Tom ⇒ Tom is 36 yrs.  
    Red must not be next to blue (true: positions 1 and 3 are separated by position 2).  
    Therefore Tom is not position 1; the only place left for age 36 is position 4.  
    Thus position 4 (orange, 45 trains) is Tom, age 36.

13. Remaining age 23 must be at position 5.

14. Planes still unassigned: 86 & 123 for positions 3 and 4.  
    Clue 1: Bob’s trains are 44 fewer than his planes.  
    – If position 3 had 86 planes: 86 – 42 = 44 ⇒ matches clue 1.  
    – So position 3 is Bob with 86 planes.  
    Position 4 therefore has 123 planes.

15. Clue 3 now gives: far right is 8 years younger than Bob (31→23) ✔.

16. Clue 4: Josh wears yellow and has 37 fewer trains than Bob (42–37 = 5).  
    – The only person with 5 trains is at position 5, so position 5 is Josh, yellow shirt.

17. The only remaining name is Tom (already at position 4). All clues now satisfied.

Final arrangement

Position 1 (far left): Doug – red shirt – age 40 – 26 planes – 98 trains  
Position 2: Steven – green shirt – age 21 – 250 planes – 105 trains  
Position 3 (centre): Bob – blue shirt – age 31 – 86 planes – 42 trains  
Position 4: Tom – orange shirt – age 36 – 123 planes – 45 trains  
Position 5 (far right): Josh – yellow shirt – age 23 – 174 planes – 5 trains

Final answer: Doug–red–40–26 planes–98 trains; Steven–green–21–250 planes–105 trains; Bob–blue–31–86 planes–42 trains; Tom–orange–36–123 planes–45 trains; Josh–yellow–23–174 planes–5 trains.",True
152,"Question: In the following code, each symbol stands for one of five letters.
$ stands for O, W, G, S, or U
& stands for H, L, A, N, or D
# stands for E, F, M, P, or V
* stands for I, O, K, J, or Y
The four letter code word, #$&*, can be translated into two English prefixes that are opposites. What are the two prefixes?
 Hint: It's not a game...",It's not a game...,"Mono and Poly, meaning one and many, not as in the game.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We are told that the four–symbol code word “#$&*” can be deciphered because each symbol may represent any one of five possible letters:  

# → E, F, M, P, V  
$ → O, W, G, S, U  
& → H, L, A, N, D  
* → I, O, K, J, Y  

Our task is to choose, for each position, two letters from the corresponding set so that the two resulting four-letter strings are English prefixes that have opposite meanings.

1. Look for pairs of opposite prefixes of exactly four letters: candidates include
   – mono / poly  (one vs. many)  
   – ante / post  (before vs. after)  
   – hypo / hyper (under vs. over)  
   etc.

2. Check each candidate pair against the allowed letter sets.

   a) mono  
      m ∈ {E F M P V} ✓  
      o ∈ {O W G S U} ✓  
      n ∈ {H L A N D} ✓

   b) poly  
      p ∈ {E F M P V} ✓  
      o ∈ {O W G S U} ✓  
      l ∈ {H L A N D} ✓  
      y ∈ {I O K J Y} ✓  

Both words satisfy the symbol–to–letter restrictions, and “mono-” (one) is the opposite of “poly-” (many).

3. The hint “It’s not a game…” alludes to the board game “Monopoly,” which cleverly combines the two prefixes “mono” and “poly,” confirming our choice.

Therefore the two opposite prefixes encoded by #$&* are “mono-” and “poly-”.

Final answer: mono and poly",True
153,"Question: In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).
 Hint: nan",,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us name the villagers who really were nominated “N-villagers”.  
Let N be the (unknown) number of such villagers.

​1.  What each person initially knows  
    • He can see the nomination status of every other villager.  
    • He does NOT know his own status.  
    • Everybody knows it is common knowledge that “at least one person was nominated”.

​2.  The critical observation nights  
    The leader says the first person who can PROVE that he was nominated must come to the hall at exactly 7 p.m. the first night he can give the proof.

    Thus the silence of the hall on night 1, night 2, … gives extra information to everyone.  
    (Exactly the same information‐building process as in the classical “blue-eyed islanders” problem.)

​3.  Proof by induction on the number N of nominations  

    Base case N = 1  
        – The unique N-villager sees nobody else nominated.  
        – Because *someone* must be nominated, he deduces it must be himself.  
        – He can prove it immediately and comes forward the 1st night.

    Inductive step  
        Assume that if the true number of nominations were k (k ≥ 1), then all k N-villagers would come forward on night k and nobody would come earlier.  

        Now suppose the true number is k+1.  
        – Every N-villager sees exactly k nominated people.  
        – Each one reasons:  
            “If I myself were **not** nominated, then only those k people I see would have been nominated and, by the induction hypothesis, they would all come forward on night k.”  
        – When no one appears on night k, each of the k+1 N-villagers realises that his last assumption was wrong, so he too must be nominated.  
        – Therefore all k+1 of them can prove their nomination and come forward on night k+1.  
        – Any non-nominated villager can never reach such a proof, because no amount of waiting excludes the possibility that only the people he already sees were nominated.

    Hence, if there are exactly N nominations, ALL and ONLY those N people will appear together on the N-th night.

​4.  Application to what actually happened  
    • Silence lasted through night 1, 2, …, 29.  
    • People finally appeared on night 30.  

    Therefore N = 30, and the 30 villagers who came forward are precisely the 30 who had been nominated.

154,"Question: One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?
 Hint: nan",,"The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.
As they were good for a meal, I suppose the kids weren't so rotten after all!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning  

1.  The story keeps using the word “kids.”  
    •  In ordinary speech “kid” can mean either a child or a young goat.  
    •  The narrator twice stresses that this is the third time “the kids” have caused trouble this month – exactly the sort of continual nuisance loose goats might create in a small town.  

2.  Details of the chase fit animals better than human children.  
    •  The “kids” run into a grocery store and “steal quite a few items” – goats will gladly help themselves to fruit and vegetables.  
    •  After dropping the goods they “turn around and start chasing him.”  Goats are notorious for butting and chasing people; small children who had just been caught stealing would almost certainly run away, not give chase.  

3.  The poem recited at the dinner contains the central clue:  
       “But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.”  
    Whatever the punishment is, it is literally going to be eaten at the dinner.  
    – If the “kids” were human, eating them would be cannibalism, yet the problem states explicitly that no one present is a cannibal.  
    – Therefore the “kids” being eaten cannot be human; they must be goats.  

4.  Everything now fits neatly.  
    •  The three trouble-making “kids” are three young goats.  
    •  Old Man Justice and the two other victims round them up, slaughter them, cook them, and serve them at a meal they call the “Repast of Right.”  
    •  The lines “No more shall they breathe!” and “Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat” become literal descriptions of the goats’ fate, not metaphors for human execution.  

Conclusion  

The “punishment” is that the three goat kids are butchered and eaten as the main course of the dinner.  

Final answer: The three “kids” are actually young goats, and their punishment is that they are slaughtered, cooked, and eaten at the dinner.",True

        k ≡ 11·1 ≡ 11 (mod 60)  ⇒  k = 11.

        t = 12 k = 12·11 = 132 minutes = 2 h 12 min.

        12 k ≡ k – 1 (mod 60)  
        11 k ≡ –1 ≡ 59 (mod 60)

        k ≡ 11·59 = 649 ≡ 49 (mod 60)  ⇒  k = 49.

        t = 12 k = 12·49 = 588 minutes = 9 h 48 min.

156,"Question: In the following code, each symbol stands for one of five letters.
! stands for I, S, A, T, or N
# stands for N, F, R, S, or T
& stands for J, E, B, O, or G
* stands for H, E, K, P, or W
^ stands for L, U, D, R, or I
The five letter code word, #&^!*, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: nan",,North and South,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning

1.  Rewrite the five “dictionaries” for the symbols, position by position in the coded word #&^!* :

   • 1st position  ‘#’  → { N , F , R , S , T }  
   • 2nd position  ‘&’  → { J , E , B , O , G }  
   • 3rd position  ‘^’  → { L , U , D , R , I }  
   • 4th position  ‘!’  → { I , S , A , T , N }  
   • 5th position  ‘*’  → { H , E , K , P , W }

2.  Look for two ordinary 5-letter English words that are antonyms and whose letters at each position both appear in the corresponding set above.

3.  Begin with natural opposite pairs (north / south, large / small, right / wrong, early / late …) and test them:

   – RIGHT / WRONG fails immediately in the 2nd position because ‘I’ and ‘R’ are not allowed there.  
   – LARGE / SMALL fails in several positions.  
   – NORTH / SOUTH passes every position:

      • Position 1: N and S are both in {N,F,R,S,T}.  
      • Position 2: O and O are both in {J,E,B,O,G}.  
      • Position 3: R and U are both in {L,U,D,R,I}.  
      • Position 4: T and T are both in {I,S,A,T,N}.  
      • Position 5: H and H are both in {H,E,K,P,W}.

4.  Since NORTH and SOUTH satisfy the symbol constraints and are opposites, they are the required pair.

Final answer: NORTH and SOUTH",True
157,"Question: I was going through some old family photos in the attic when I stumbled upon our family tree.  I studied it for a couple minutes then went back down stairs to tell my mom about the family tree.  The problem is I didn't study it long enough to remember the whole thing.  I only remembered  a couple things about it, and recent memories.  Can you help me figure out my family tree?  There are two grandparents, who had two children, who both got married and had 2 more children each.  Totaling 10 people in all (Alex, David, Jamie, Jessica, John, Justin, Lincoln, Martha, Mary and Tina).
1.  One of Jamie's ancestors was David.
2.  John's sister gave birth to Tina.
3.  Mary went bowling with her nephew last Saturday.
4.  Alex is cousins with one of the girls.
5.  Justin married Mary.
6.  Jessica is not an ancestor, nor cousin of Tina.
7. Lincoln's brother showed Justin's son his baseball cards.
 Hint: nan",,"Martha and David were the grandparents.
They gave birth to John and Mary.
John married Jessica, who gave birth to Lincoln and Alex.
Mary married Justin and gave birth to Tina and Jamie.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We have to fit the ten names into the fixed pattern  

• 2 grandparents  
• their 2 children  
• the two children’s spouses  
• 2 children for each couple (4 grandchildren)  

so 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 people.

Step-by-step deduction

1.  “Justin married Mary.”  
   ⇒ Mary is one of the two middle-generation children, Justin is her spouse.

2.  “Mary went bowling with her nephew …”  
   ⇒ Mary’s sibling (the other middle-generation child) has at least one son.

3.  “John’s sister gave birth to Tina.”  
   ⇒ John’s sister is Mary and Tina is Mary’s daughter.  
   So the two middle-generation children are  
        John and Mary (who is married to Justin).

4.  “Lincoln’s brother showed Justin’s son his baseball cards.”  
   – Justin’s son is the other child of Mary.  
   – Lincoln and his brother therefore belong to the other family (John’s children).  
   ⇒ John and his spouse have two sons: Lincoln and his brother.

5.  “Alex is cousins with one of the girls.”  
   The girl cousins are Tina (and perhaps others later).  
   ⇒ Alex is the brother of Lincoln (John’s other son).

6.  “Jessica is not an ancestor nor cousin of Tina.”  
   The only roles left that are neither ancestors nor cousins of Tina are
   aunt/uncle or spouse of an ancestor.  
   The only remaining unnamed person in the middle generation is John’s spouse,  
   so Jessica is John’s wife.

7.  “One of Jamie’s ancestors was David.”  
   ⇒ David must be in an older generation than Jamie.  
   Putting David among the grandparents makes this automatically true,  
   so David is one grandparent.  
   The only unused name left for the other grandparent is Martha,  
   and Jamie must be a grandchild.

Collecting everything:

Grandparents: David (m) married to Martha (f)

Their children (generation 2):  
 • John (m) married to Jessica (f)  
 • Mary (f) married to Justin (m)

Grandchildren (generation 3):  
 Children of John & Jessica – Alex (m) and Lincoln (m)  
 Children of Mary & Justin – Jamie (m) and Tina (f)

Verification of every clue:

1. Jamie’s ancestor David – yes (grandfather).  
2. John’s sister (Mary) gave birth to Tina – yes.  
3. Mary’s nephew (Alex or Lincoln) went bowling with her – yes.  
4. Alex is cousin to a girl (Tina) – yes.  
5. Justin married Mary – yes.  
6. Jessica is neither ancestor nor cousin of Tina (she is Tina’s aunt) – yes.  
7. Lincoln’s brother (Alex) showed Justin’s son (Jamie) his cards – yes.

All clues satisfied.

Final answer:  
Grandparents – David and Martha  
Children – John (married Jessica) and Mary (married Justin)  
Grandchildren – Alex & Lincoln (children of John and Jessica), Jamie & Tina (children of Mary and Justin)",True
158,"Question: Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?
 Hint: nan",,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us label the children’s present day of conversation by T  
and number the days of the week 0,1,…,6 with  

0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, … , 6 = Saturday.  
(The arithmetic will always be done “mod 7”, i.e. we only care about the day-name.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Decoding “When the day after tomorrow is yesterday …”
--------------------------------------------------------------------
“the day after tomorrow” (from the children’s present) is T+2.  
We want some later day A on which that very day is “yesterday”, i.e.

  A – 1  ≡  T + 2   (mod 7)   ⇒   A ≡ T + 3.        (1)

So the quoted time A is three days after the present one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Decoding “… that day which was ‘today’ when the day before yesterday was tomorrow”
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To interpret this, notice that right now

  “the day before yesterday’’ = T – 2.

When, in the past, was this same day called “tomorrow”?  
Obviously on the day immediately preceding it, viz.

  B ≡ (T – 2) – 1 = T – 3.                                          (2)

Thus B is the day three days **before** the present one, and
“that day which was ‘today’ …” is simply the calendar day B ( = T – 3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  The condition on distances from Sunday
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Priscilla says that on day A ( = T + 3) the word “today” will be
“as far from Sunday as” day B ( = T – 3) is from Sunday.

Let d(x) be the (shortest) number of days from x to Sunday; in symbols  
d(x)=min{x, 7–x}.  
The condition is therefore

  d(T + 3) = d(T – 3).                                               (3)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Solving (3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute d(T + 3) and d(T – 3) for every possible present day T:

 T   T+3   d(T+3)   T–3   d(T–3)
 0   3     3        4     3        ← equal
 1   4     3        5     2
 2   5     2        6     1
 3   6     1        0     0
 4   0     0        1     1
 5   1     1        2     2
 6   2     2        3     3

Equality of the two distances occurs only in the first line, i.e. when

  T = 0  →  the present day is Sunday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Consistency check
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  If today is Sunday, the day after tomorrow is Tuesday.  
   Three days hence (on Wednesday) Tuesday will indeed be “yesterday”.

•  Today = Sunday ⇒ the day before yesterday = Friday.  
   Friday is called “tomorrow’’ on Thursday, so the “other” day in
   Priscilla’s comparison is Thursday.

•  Distances from Sunday:
     Wednesday is 3 days after Sunday,  
     Thursday is 3 days before Sunday (i.e. also 3 away).  
   Hence the distances match, exactly as stated.

Everything is consistent only when the children were talking on a Sunday.

160,"Question: Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?
 Hint: nan",,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.
(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.  Obviously, I've changed the names).",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the whole estate be represented by 1.

Biggie’s will was written for just one child, so it contains two mutually-exclusive directions:

A.  “If the child is a boy, give 2⁄3 to the son and 1⁄3 to the widow.”  
B.  “If the child is a girl, give 2⁄3 to the widow and 1⁄3 to the daughter.”

Because twins of different sexes were born, both conditions are now true at the same time, but they cannot both be carried out on the whole estate – together they would demand twice as much money as exists.

The judge’s solution was to treat the two instructions as having equal standing (they were meant for two equally likely, but originally mutually-exclusive, situations).  
He therefore:

1. Split the estate into two equal halves.  
2. Applied clause A to the first half.  
   • Son: 2⁄3 of 1⁄2 = 1⁄3 of the whole estate.  
   • Widow: 1⁄3 of 1⁄2 = 1⁄6 of the whole estate.  
3. Applied clause B to the second half.  
   • Widow: 2⁄3 of 1⁄2 = 1⁄3 of the whole estate.  
   • Daughter: 1⁄3 of 1⁄2 = 1⁄6 of the whole estate.  

Now combine the two halves:

Widow = 1⁄6 + 1⁄3 = 1⁄2 of the estate  
Son  = 1⁄3 of the estate  
Daughter = 1⁄6 of the estate  

The three shares add up to the whole estate and each half of the will has been honored as far as possible.

163,"Question: Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""
 Hint: The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55

74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.
(P.S. Sorry if this offended anybody, not that I think it would, but in my other teaser people were complaining so I'm just putting this in here for warning).",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We label the four two–digit “sets”  

A-B-C-D  (A = 1st set, B = 2nd, C = 3rd, D = 4th).

Convert every clue into equations/conditions.

1.  Digit-sum(C) is 11, 12 or 13.  
2.  C = D − 13.  
3.  2·B + 7 = A.  
4.  Digit-sum(D) > digit-sum(A).  
5.  Digits 0,3,6 never appear; every one of 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 appears at least once in the whole combination.  
6.  A is a perfect square ≤ 60.  (Squares ≤ 60: 16,25,36,49; discard any containing 0,3 or 6.)

Hence A can only be 25 or 49.

• If A = 25 then 2B + 7 = 25 ⇒ B = 9 (one-digit, and would contain a prohibited 0 if written 09).  
  So A = 25 is impossible.

• Therefore A = 49 (digits 4 and 9; digit-sum 13).

Now digit-sum(D) > 13, so digit-sum(D) is 14–18.
With forbidden digits removed, possible D’s are:
   78, 79, 87, 88, 89, 95, 97, 98, 99, 59.

For each, compute C = D − 13 and keep only those whose digits are allowed and whose digit-sum is 11–13:

D   →   C = D−13   →   digit-sum(C)
87      74              11   ✓  
88      75              12   ✓  
97      84              12   ✓  
98      85              13   ✓  
(all other D’s give C with 0,3,6 or wrong digit-sum).

So the viable (C,D) pairs are (74,87), (75,88), (84,97), (85,98).

Now use 3: B = (A−7)/2 = (49−7)/2 = 21 (digits 2,1, both allowed).

Check condition 5 (we must have all of 1,2,4,5,7,8,9 somewhere):

Pair (74,87): digits present = 1,2,4,4,7,7,8,9  → missing 5  ✗  
Pair (75,88): digits present = 1,2,4,5,7,8,8,9  → all required digits ✓  
Pair (84,97): digits present = 1,2,4,4,8,9,9,7  → missing 5 ✗  
Pair (85,98): digits present = 1,2,4,5,8,9,9,8  → missing 7 ✗

Only the second pair (C,D) = (75,88) satisfies every clue.

Thus
A = 49,  B = 21,  C = 75,  D = 88.

164,"Question: In the following code, each symbol stands for one of five letters.
* stands for T, L, M, V, or Y
# stands for S, H, C, M, or B
^ stands for F, S, K, I, or O
$ stands for O, W, G, U, or P
The four letter code word, #$^*, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: nan",,Boom and Bust.,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We are told that the coded form #$^* can be deciphered by choosing, for each symbol, any one of the five letters listed for that symbol.

Symbol → possible letters  
# → S , H , C , M , B  
$ → O , W , G , U , P  
^ → F , S , K , I , O  
* → T , L , M , V , Y  

Our task: find two ordinary 4-letter English words that
1. fit the pattern #$^* (i.e. their first, second, third and fourth letters come from the respective lists above), and  
2. are opposites of each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Generate legitimate words from the allowed letters.

Look first at words whose first letter is B (allowed for #):

• BOOM:  
   B (from #), O (from $), O (from ^), M (from *) ⟹ valid.

• BUST:  
   B (from #), U (from $), S (from ^), T (from *) ⟹ valid.

Both words are in common use and meet all four positional letter restrictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Check for the antonym (opposite) relationship.

“Boom” and “bust” form a standard, well-known pair of opposites, especially in economics (a period of prosperity vs. a period of collapse).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Verify that no other simpler or more familiar antonym pair exists among the allowed words.

A quick scan of other possible #-words (SOFT, COOL, HOST, COST, MOST, COIL, SOIL, BOIL, etc.) shows no other pair that is as clear-cut an antonym set as BOOM/BUST and that simultaneously satisfies the letter-set constraints.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion.

The coded word #$^* can represent either

B  O  O  M  → BOOM  
B  U  S  T  → BUST  

which are opposites.

Final answer: BOOM and BUST",True
165,"Question: There are three students Anu, Bob and Coy. They have exactly three books - one on Physics, one on Chemistry and one on Math. Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.
 Hint: nan",,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

  P , C , M  be the owners of the Physics–, Chemistry– and Maths–books respectively  
  (each of P , C , M is one of A = Anu, B = Bob, C = Coy).

The three sets of statements are  

Anu  
  A1 : P = A  
  A2 : M ≠ B  
  A3 : C ≠ C  

Bob  
  B1 : P ≠ B  
  B2 : C = C  
  B3 : M ≠ A  

Coy  
  C1 : P ≠ A  
  C2 : M ≠ C  
  C3 : C ≠ B  

Exactly one student is a Truth–teller (all statements true), one a Liar (all false) and one an Alternator (T L T or L T L).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 :  Assume Anu is the Truth–teller  
          (so A1, A2, A3 are all true)

          ⇒ P = A ,      M ≠ B ,      C ≠ C            … (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 :  Try to make Bob the Liar (all Bob’s statements false)

          B1 false ⇒ P = B , contradicts P = A in (1).  
          Hence Bob cannot be the Liar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 :  Make Coy the Liar (all Coy’s statements false)

          C1 false ⇒ P = A                           (agrees with (1))  
          C2 false ⇒ M = C                           (2)  
          C3 false ⇒ C = B                           (3)

          (1), (2), (3) are mutually consistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 :  Bob must therefore be the Alternator.  
          With P = A , C = B , M = C we get

          B1 : ‘P ≠ B’            – True  
          B2 : ‘C = C’            – False  
          B3 : ‘M ≠ A’            – True  

          The pattern T F T (True–False–True) is an allowed alternation.  
          Hence this assignment satisfies all the conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 :  Show it is the ONLY possible assignment.

The six possible role–distributions (T,L,A) were all examined:

  A=T,B=A,C=L   – possible (found above)  
  A=T,B=L,C=A   – impossible  
  A=L,B=T,C=A   – impossible  
  A=L,B=A,C=T   – impossible  
  A=A,B=T,C=L   – impossible  
  A=A,B=L,C=T   – impossible  

Thus the unique consistent situation is

        Truth–teller : Anu  
        Liar         : Coy  
        Alternator   : Bob  
        Book owners  : Physics – Anu,  Chemistry – Bob,  Maths – Coy

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusions that are certain:

1) “Anu always tells the truth.”          – Yes, Anu is the Truth–teller.  
2) “Coy always lies.”                     – Yes, Coy is the Liar.  
3) “Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.” – Yes, C = B.

All three statements are necessarily true.

166,"Question: Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.

2. (C∈S ∨ V∈S) → A∉S.            (2)
3. (A∉S ∧ W∉S) → Ch∈S.           (3)

Step 1:  Assume V∉S.  
From (6): A∉S and Ch∉S.  
From (4): V∉S ⇒ L∈S.  Hence S = {L, x}, x≠A,Ch,V.

• If x = W, then statement (5) fails (W is with neither C nor Ch).  
• If x = C, then (3) fails (A∉S and W∉S but Ch∉S).  

Thus V∉S is impossible.  Therefore V∈S.

Step 2:  With V∈S, statement (2) forces A∉S.

The second knight must be chosen from {W, L, C, Ch}.  
Consider the two possibilities for W.

• Case 2a: W∈S ⇒ S = {V, W}.  
  By (5) W must be accompanied by C or Ch, impossible with only two seats.  
  Hence this case is impossible.

• Case 2b: W∉S.  
  Since A∉S and W∉S, statement (3) requires Ch∈S.  
  Therefore S = {V, Ch}.  Check all rules:

  (1) antecedent false (V is in S) – OK  
  (2) V∈S ⇒ A∉S – satisfied  
  (3) A∉S ∧ W∉S ⇒ Ch∈S – satisfied  
  (4) L∉S ∧ A∉S ⇒ V∈S – satisfied

The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth.

170,"Question: The last contestant has just completed the cycling leg of the triathlon.  The 15 clues that follow are with respect to this point in the race.  From the clues you must determine:  the color of shorts each runner is wearing, the positions at the end of the cycling leg, and the final standings.
Contestants in the race:  Alvin, Brian, Chuck, David, Ethan, Frank
Colors of their shorts:  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
1) Brian moved up two places, now just behind the runner in the red shorts.
2) The runner in the yellow shorts fell down, lost an even number of positions, and was now in last place.
3) Frank moved ahead of the runner who wore the blue shorts.
4) The runner in the orange shorts took over the lead.
5) Ethan and the runner in the green shorts switched places.
6) David moved ahead of Brian, who was not wearing the blue shorts.
7) Chuck stubbed his toe, lost one position, and was now just ahead of Alvin.
8) Ethan and Brian, neither one who wore the violet shorts, switched places.
9) Alvin moved ahead of the runners who wore the green and orange shorts.
10) David dropped behind the runners who wore the blue and violet shorts.
11) The runner in the yellow shorts moved ahead of David.
12) Chuck moved ahead of the runner who wore the orange shorts.
13) With a burst of speed, David moved ahead of Ethan, Frank, and the runner in the yellow shorts.
14) Ethan moved ahead of the runner who wore the red shorts.
15) Out of breath, the runner wearing the green shorts fell behind Brian, who now trailed the runner wearing the yellow shorts.  No further position changes occur.  The race ends.

From Clue 7 and Clue 9, Chuck can only be orange or green.  From Clue 12, Chuck can not be orange, therefore he must be green.  This leaves David wearing red, Frank wearing violet, and Alvin wearing yellow.  This establishes:  Alvin = yellow, Brian = orange, Chuck = green, David = red, Ethan = blue, Frank = violet

171,"Question: Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?
 Hint: nan",,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the six pieces weigh  

15 lb , 16 lb , 18 lb , 19 lb , 20 lb , 31 lb .

Exactly one of them is the Chillirella; the other five are Kebabrie.

1.  Norma buys two Kebabrie pieces.  
   Let their total weight be N.

2.  Laura buys Kebabrie whose total weight is twice Norma’s, i.e. 2 N.

3.  Altogether the two women buy N + 2 N = 3 N pounds of Kebabrie.

4.  There are only five Kebabrie pieces in the shop.  
    If even one Kebabrie were left unsold, its weight would have to be added to 3 N, causing the sold weight to be less than the total Kebabrie weight.  
    But Laura could always have taken that last piece instead, increasing her purchase and keeping the ratio 2 : 1 impossible.  
    Therefore every Kebabrie piece must have been sold; the only piece left in the shop is the single Chillirella.

   Hence  

   (total weight of all Kebabrie pieces) = 3 N  
   ⇒ (total weight of all Kebabrie pieces) must be divisible by 3.

5.  Test each possible choice for the Chillirella:

   • If Chillirella = 31 lb, Kebabrie total = 15+16+18+19+20 = 88 (not divisible by 3).  
   • If Chillirella = 20 lb, Kebabrie total = 15+16+18+19+31 = 99 (divisible by 3).  
   • If Chillirella = 19 lb, Kebabrie total = 100 (not divisible by 3).  
   • If Chillirella = 18 lb, Kebabrie total = 101 (not divisible by 3).  
   • If Chillirella = 16 lb, Kebabrie total = 103 (not divisible by 3).  
   • If Chillirella = 15 lb, Kebabrie total = 104 (not divisible by 3).

   The only possible case is that the Chillirella weighs 20 lb and the five Kebabrie pieces total 99 lb.

6.  Now N = 99/3 = 33 lb.  
    Norma must have bought two pieces whose weights add to 33 lb.  
    Among the Kebabrie pieces {15, 16, 18, 19, 31} the only such pair is 15 lb + 18 lb.

    Laura then buys the remaining three Kebabrie pieces 16 lb, 19 lb, and 31 lb, whose total is 66 lb = 2 × 33 lb, exactly twice Norma’s purchase.

Everything is consistent, so the single unsold piece—the Chillirella—weighs 20 pounds.

172,"Question: Twelve men are in a room, some of them always tell lies, while the others always tell the truth.

Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

T = the actual number of truthtellers in the room (0 ≤ T ≤ 12).

Statement of man k (k = 1,…,12):
Sₖ : “At most k – 1 of us are truthtellers.”
Formally, Sₖ is the claim “T ≤ k – 1”.

Truth–value of Sₖ
• Sₖ is TRUE  ⇔  T ≤ k – 1.  
• Sₖ is FALSE ⇔  T ≥ k.

Because a man always tells the truth iff his own statement is true, the number of true statements must equal T itself.

Now test each possible T.

T = 0  
Every Sₖ is true (0 ≤ k – 1), so 12 statements would be true, contradicting T = 0.  
→ impossible.

T = 1  
S₁ is false, S₂–S₁₂ are true → 11 true statements ≠ 1.  
→ impossible.

T = 2  
S₁,S₂ false; S₃–S₁₂ true → 10 true statements ≠ 2.  
→ impossible.

Continue similarly:

T = 3 ⇒ 9 true statements (impossible)  
T = 4 ⇒ 8 true statements (impossible)  
T = 5 ⇒ 7 true statements (impossible)

T = 6  
S₁–S₆ are false (since 6 ≥ k for k = 1,…,6)  
S₇–S₁₂ are true  (since 6 ≤ k – 1 for k = 7,…,12)  
Thus exactly 6 statements are true, matching T = 6.  
→ consistent.

For larger T:

T = 7 gives only 5 true statements,  
T = 8 gives 4,  
T = 9 gives 3,  
T = 10 gives 2,  
T = 11 gives 1,  
T = 12 gives 0 — none match T.

Hence the only possible total is T = 6, with the true statements being S₇–S₁₂.

Therefore men 1 through 6 are the liars, and men 7 through 12 are the truthtellers.

 “Is card 2 an ace?”

After you hear the answer do this:  
• If he says “YES”, turn over card 2.  
• If he says “NO”, turn over card 3.

Why this always works

1. Card 1 is the jack (so the answer is random).  
 Then cards 2 and 3 are both aces, so whichever one you turn over is an ace.

2. Card 1 is an ace (so the answer is truthful).  
 • If the truthful answer is “YES”, card 2 really is an ace, so you turn over an ace.  
 • If the truthful answer is “NO”, card 2 is the jack, which forces card 3 to be the remaining ace, so you still turn over an ace.

In every possible situation the procedure reveals an ace with certainty, using only one yes/no question while pointing at exactly one card.

• Mrs Johnson’s husband is Mr Johnson.  
• Mrs Jones’s husband is Mr Jones.  
• Mr & Mrs Johnson have a daughter, Mrs Williams, whose husband is

1.  Translate the six rules into a directed graph.  
   A → B,E  B → C,E  C → D,F  D → A,F  E → B,D  F → C,D  
   We have to find a path that visits every vertex once (a Hamiltonian path).

2.  Because ‘three doors are entrances only and three are exits only’ and the prisoner must ‘alternate exits and entrances’, the required path must have the pattern  
   exit – entrance – exit – entrance – exit – entrance  
   (the prisoner starts inside the guard-room, so his first move must be through an exit).

3.  The scene with the guards fixes three doors:  
   • the guards “came in” through A and F  ⇒  A and F are entrances;  
   • they “went out” through B            ⇒  B is an exit.

4.  Therefore, in the 6-door sequence  
   positions 1, 3, 5 must be exits (so B must occupy one of them);  
   positions 2, 4, 6 must be entrances (so A and F must occupy two of them).

5.  List the Hamiltonian paths of the graph; there are only eleven.  
   ABEDFC, AEB CDF, AEB CFD, BCF DAE, CFD ABE, DAE BCF,  
   EBC FDA, EDA BCF, FCD ABE, FCD AEB, FDA EBC

6.  Impose the entrance/exit pattern of step 4 on each path:

   • ABEDFC   begins with an entrance  →  reject  
   • AEB CDF  ends with an exit F      →  reject  
   • AEB CFD  has B as an entrance     →  reject  
   • BCF DAE  puts F in an exit place  →  reject  
   • CFD ABE  satisfies every condition  
   • the remaining six violate at least one of the three fixed directions.

7.  Check CFDABE:

   C → F  (allowed)  
   F → D  (allowed)  
   D → A  (allowed)  
   A → B  (allowed)  
   B → E  (allowed)

   Direction pattern:  
   C (exit), F (entrance), D (exit), A (entrance), B (exit), E (entrance)  
   This gives exactly three exits (C, D, B) and three entrances (F, A, E) with A and F entrances and B exit, exactly as required.

182,"Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?
 Hint: nan",,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of Citrate and half of Sildenafil. Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning	

1.	What you have in your hand  
   • 1 unknown Sildenafil tablet (call it S).  
   • 2 unknown Citrate tablets (call them C₁ and C₂).

2.	Goal  
   To obtain a dose that contains exactly 1 S + 1 C today – and not waste any pill.

3.	Observation  
   If a tablet cannot be distinguished, the only safe operation is to treat every tablet identically.  
   The simplest identical operation we can perform is “cut it exactly in half.”  
   After halving a tablet, each half contains one-half of whatever the tablet originally was.  
   Cutting does not destroy any medicine, so nothing is wasted.

4.	Cut all three mixed tablets in half  
   You now have six half-tablets:  
         S½ , S½ , C₁½ , C₁½ , C₂½ , C₂½.  

5.	Assemble two equal piles from these halves  
   Put one half of each original tablet into pile A and the other half into pile B:  

          pile A : S½ + C₁½ + C₂½  
          pile B : S½ + C₁½ + C₂½  

   Each pile therefore contains  
          ½ S + ½ C₁ + ½ C₂  = ½ S + 1 full Citrate dose.  
   So each pile is still missing half of a Sildenafil tablet.

6.	Provide the missing half-Sildenafil to each pile  
   Take one fresh Sildenafil tablet from the bottle (this one you do know is Sildenafil, because you have not opened the Citrate bottle again).  
   Cut it in half.  
   Put one half of this known Sildenafil into pile A and the other half into pile B.

          pile A : (S½ + S½) + (C₁½ + C₂½) = 1 S + 1 C  
          pile B : (S½ + S½) + (C₁½ + C₂½) = 1 S + 1 C  

7.	Result  
   • Pile A is a perfect daily dose (1 Sildenafil + 1 Citrate).  
   • Pile B is also a perfect daily dose (1 Sildenafil + 1 Citrate).  

8.	Take pile A today.  
   Store pile B in a labeled envelope for tomorrow’s dose.  

9.	Pill accounting  
   Originally in hand: 1 S + 2 C.  
   Added from the bottle: 1 S.  
   Total used: 2 S + 2 C, which is exactly what you will need over two days.  
   No pill is thrown away or wasted, and no incorrect dose is ever swallowed.

Final answer: Cut all three mixed tablets in half, split the halves into two piles, add half of a known Sildenafil tablet to each pile; each pile then contains exactly one Sildenafil and one Citrate—take one pile today and keep the other for tomorrow, wasting nothing.",True

|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.

 Hint: All four facts are in the form of ""hypothesis and conclusion"" statements. If the hypothesis of such a statement is false, the whole statement is true.

Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan. Then either Al lives east of both Carl and Dan (contradicting fact 4) or Carl and Dan both live east of Al (contradicting fact 2.) So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 2 is false, Carl must live east of Al. Therefore, conclusion 3 is true.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

• Apos, Bpos, Cpos, Dpos be the apartments (1–4) of Al, Ben, Carl, Dan.

4. P₄: “Dan east of Al (Dpos > Apos)”  Q₄: “L = Ben and Bpos = 2”  
   Condition: (¬P₄) ∨ Q₄.

Because the landlord is unique, at most one of Q₁–Q₄ can be true.

────────────────────────────────────────
Case 1 L = Al  
• If Apos = 1 (Q₁ true) ⇒ Statement 4 would need Dpos ≤ 1, impossible.  
• If Apos ≠ 1 (Q₁ false) ⇒ Ben must be next to both Carl and Dan and Dan ≤ Al ≤ Carl.  
  Exhausting the four possible consecutive triples shows Al has no free apartment.  
Hence L ≠ Al.

Case 2 L = Dan  
• If Dpos = 4 (Q₂ true) ⇒ Statement 4 needs Dpos ≤ Apos, impossible.  
• If Dpos ≠ 4 (Q₂ false) ⇒ Ben must be next to both Carl and Dan and Dan ≤ Al ≤ Carl.  
  Again the only possible triples (1-2-3 or 2-3-4) leave no place for Al.  
Hence L ≠ Dan.

Case 3 L = Carl  

Sub-case 3a Cpos = 3 (Q₃ true)  
Statement 1 forces Carl next to Ben; Statement 2 forces Apos ≤ 3;  
Statement 4 forces Dpos ≤ Apos.  

Put Carl in 3.  
• If Ben were in 2, Al and Dan cannot occupy the only free flats 1 and 4 while keeping Dpos ≤ Apos.  
• Place Ben in 4 instead. Then flats 1 and 2 remain for Al and Dan with Dpos ≤ Apos.  
  Choose Dan-1, Al-2 – all constraints are now met:

  Apartment 1 2 3 4  
  Person  Dan  Al  Carl  Ben  

Check all statements:

1. Carl is next to Ben → P₁ false → statement 1 true.  
2. Al is west of Carl → P₂ false → statement 2 true.  
3. Ben not next to Dan (true) and Q₃ true → statement 3 true.  
4. Dan west of Al → P₄ false → statement 4 true.

Sub-case 3b Cpos ≠ 3 (Q₃ false) makes Ben next to both Carl and Dan and again leaves no
place for Al, so impossible.

Hence the only possible arrangement is  
Dan – Al – Carl – Ben (west to east), and the landlord is Carl.

186,"Question: Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?
 Hint: nan",,"To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us translate the story into a piece of arithmetic.

1.  How long before the two clocks read the same again?  
    •  One clock gains 10 s every hour, the other loses 10 s every hour.  
    •  Their relative speed is therefore 20 s per hour.  
    •  In order for two 12-hour dials to show the same reading, one dial must get 12 h (= 43 200 s) ahead of the other.  
    •  Time required = 43 200 s ÷ 20 s / h = 2 160 h = 90 days.

    So, exactly 90 days after they are set, the faces of the two clocks will coincide.

2.  When can “90 days after some day in January” fall in May?  
    Work with an ordinary (non-leap) year first.

       Jan   31 days  
       Feb   28  
       Mar   31  
       Apr   30  
       May   31  

    Let the January setting date be January d (1 ≤ d ≤ 31).  
    Its day-of-year number is D₁ = d.  
    After 90 days the day-of-year number is D₂ = D₁ + 90.

    For the result to lie in May we need 121 ≤ D₂ ≤ 151, because
       121 = day number of May 1 (31+28+31+30+1)  
       151 = day number of May 31 (add another 30).

    Hence 121 ≤ D₁+90 ≤ 151 → 31 ≤ D₁ ≤ 61.  
    But January only has 31 days, so the only possible value is D₁ = 31.

    Therefore the clocks must be set on 31 January, and the coincidence occurs on 1 May.

3.  The year must be a non-leap year.  
    In a leap year February has 29 days, so 90 days after 31 January is 30 April, not 1 May.  
    Thus the January in question is in a non-leap year.

4.  Whose 47th birthday falls on 1 May of a non-leap year?  
    The two birth years are 1932 and 1933.

       •  Someone born 1 May 1932 turns 47 on 1 May 1979.  
         (1979 is not a leap year, so everything fits.)  
       •  Someone born 1 May 1933 turns 47 on 1 May 1980.  
         But 1980 is a leap year, contradicting point 3.

    Hence the friend whose 47th birthday is being mentioned (Smoe) must be the one born in 1932.

So Smoe is the elder (born May 1932), and Joe is one year younger (born May 1933).

Final answer: Smoe is older than Joe.",True

Sue was in blue and made nine spinning tops.
Jane was in red and made five balls.
Spry Johnny was in green and made three racing cars.
Cher was in yellow and made six trains.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1    List the facts in “variable” form  

•  Five elves = {Cher, Johnny, Jane, Marcia, Sue}.  
•  Five suit-colours = {red, yellow, green, orange, blue}.  
•  Five toy kinds = {racing-cars, trains, sleds, spinning-tops, balls}.  
•  Five different numbers (>2) whose sum is 30.  
•  Fixed clues  
  – Jane made 5 toys.  
  – Johnny made the racing-cars.  
  – Cher made 1 more toy than the red-suited elf, and 1 less than the
    sled-maker (so three consecutive numbers: red, Cher, sled).  
  – The green-suited elf made ⅓ as many toys as Sue.  
  – The spinner of tops made the most toys.  
  – The yellow-suited elf made all the trains.  
  – Marcia wore orange; one elf wore blue.  

Step 2    Find the only possible set of numbers  

All five numbers must be distinct integers >2 that add to 30.
Listing all such 5-element sets we get

{3,4,5,6,12}, {3,4,5,7,11}, {3,4,5,8,10},  
{3,4,6,7,10}, {3,4,6,8,9}, {3,5,6,7,9}, {4,5,6,7,8}.

The green/Sue relation demands that one number be triple another.
Only two sets satisfy that:
 A = {3,4,5,6,12}  (because 12 = 3×4)
 F = {3,5,6,7,9}   (because 9 = 3×3).

Set A fails, for with Cher = 6 the sled-maker would need 7, but 7 is
not in the set.  
Hence the numbers must be {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}.

Step 3    Fix the numbers around Cher  

Because the set contains 5, 6, 7, the three consecutive numbers can be
5 (red) – 6 (Cher) – 7 (sled).  
Thus  
 red-suited elf ……… 5  
 Cher ………………… 6  
 sled-maker ………… 7

Since Jane is the only elf who made 5 toys, Jane must be the
red-suited elf.

Step 4    Use the green/Sue relation  

The only 3-to-1 ratio in the set is 3 and 9, so

 green-suited elf … 3  
 Sue ………………… 9

Step 5    Assign the remaining numbers to the remaining elves  

Numbers so far
 Jane 5  Cher 6  ? 7  ? 3  Sue 9

Only Johnny and Marcia are left.  
Johnny already has the toy kind “racing-cars”.
Choose

 Johnny … 3 (thereby becoming the green-suited elf)  
 Marcia … 7 (thereby becoming the sled-maker)

Step 6    Finish colours and toy kinds  

Colours used: red (Jane), green (Johnny), orange (Marcia).
Remaining colours: yellow and blue.

The yellow-suited elf must make trains, and it cannot be Sue (because
Sue makes spinning-tops).  Therefore

You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.
 Hint: ??-??-66-??",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;

Congratulations!!! You won, again!! You are over the moon! You have become the first millionaire in five generations of your family history!!",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the four two–digit sets be  

Set 1 = AB, Set 2 = CD, Set 3 = 66, Set 4 = EF  

(we already know from the hint that the third set is 66).

Step-by-step through the clues

1. 6 + D < 8  (first digit of the third set plus second digit of the second set)  
   ⇒ D < 2, and since 0 isn’t allowed, D = 1.  
   So Set 2 ends in 1 → CD = C1.

2. Digits 5 and 7 are never used.   (Keep this in mind.)

3. A + B ≠ 10.   (For Set 1.)

4. 4 × (CD) = (EF) reversed  
   ⇒ 4 × (C1) = FE.  
   CD must be small enough that 4 × (CD) is still two digits, so CD ≤ 24.  
   The only two–digit numbers ≤24 that end with 1 are 11 and 21.

   • If CD = 11, then 4 × 11 = 44 ⇒ FE = 44 ⇒ EF = 44.  
     But the combination must contain exactly one 8 (clue 8); 44 has none.  
     So CD ≠ 11.

   • Therefore CD = 21.  
     4 × 21 = 84 ⇒ FE = 84 ⇒ EF = 48.  
     EF = 48 indeed contains the single required 8, and no 0,5,7.

   Thus Set 2 = 21 and Set 4 = 48.

5. No set exceeds 90 – already satisfied so far.

6. 20 < A × B < 30 for Set 1, and digits 5,7,8 can’t be used in Set 1.  
   Possible digit pairs (A,B) from {1,2,3,4,6,9} with product 21–29:

        3×9 = 27,   9×3 = 27,   4×6 = 24,   6×4 = 24

   But 4+6 = 10 (disallowed by clue 3), so pairs with {4,6} are out.  
   That leaves (3,9) or (9,3).

7. Check clue 5 again: a set may not be above 90. 93 would violate this, 
   whereas 39 does not. So the only admissible first set is 39.

All clues are now met:

39-21-66-48  
• 6+1=7 (<8) ✓  
• No 5 or 7 anywhere ✓  
• 3+9=12 (≠10) ✓  
• 4×21=84 → 48 reversed ✓  
• No set >90 ✓  
• 3×9=27 (between 20 and 30) ✓  
• Includes the set 66 ✓  
• Exactly one 8, in the last set ✓

190,"Question: A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?
 Hint: Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 – What has to be achieved  
The prisoners do not have to identify their own hat colours; they only need to make sure that either  
• every single guess is right,  or  
• every single guess is wrong.  
If they can force one of these two global outcomes no matter how the warden arranges the hats, they all go free.

Step 2 – Work it out for a small number of prisoners  

Two prisoners  
Suppose each of the two prisoners tries the following rule:

 “If I see a white hat on the other prisoner I will say ‘black’;  
  if I see a black hat on the other prisoner I will say ‘white’.”

There are four possible actual arrangements:

 1) WW  → each sees W, says B → both wrong  
 2) BB  → each sees B, says W → both wrong  
 3) WB  → first sees B says W (wrong), second sees W says B (wrong) → both wrong  
 4) BW  → symmetric to 3) → both wrong  

Whichever way the warden chooses, both prisoners are always wrong, hence they go free.  
The rule worked, but it depended on there being exactly one other hat to look at.

Three prisoners  
Now imagine the same “opposite-colour” rule with three prisoners A, B, C.  
Arrangement BWB, for example, would give A→? , B→?, C→?, and one finds that some prisoners would be right and some wrong. The simple “look at one other hat” rule no longer guarantees the needed all-right/all-wrong outcome.

So we need a property that every prisoner can compute from what he sees that stays related in exactly the same way for all of them, no matter how many prisoners there are.  The natural such property is PARITY (whether the number of something is even or odd).

Step 3 – The common strategy (works for any number N ≥ 1)  

Agreed beforehand:

 “Count how many BLACK hats you can see.  
 If the number you see is EVEN, announce ‘WHITE’.  
 If the number you see is ODD,  announce ‘BLACK’.”

(Any consistent swapping of the words ‘white’ and ‘black’ would work as well; they just have to decide it together in advance.)

Step 4 – Why the strategy always frees them  

Let T be the total number of black hats actually on all heads (chosen by the warden).  

Case 1: T is EVEN  
• A prisoner whose own hat is white sees exactly T black hats (even) → he says ‘white’ → correct.  
• A prisoner whose own hat is black sees T−1 black hats (odd) → he says ‘black’ → correct.  
Thus every prisoner speaks the correct colour. They are all right ⇒ they go free.

Case 2: T is ODD  
• A prisoner whose own hat is white sees T black hats (odd) → he says ‘black’ → wrong.  
• A prisoner whose own hat is black sees T−1 black hats (even) → he says ‘white’ → wrong.  
Thus every prisoner speaks the incorrect colour. They are all wrong ⇒ they go free.

Therefore, whether the warden makes the total number of black hats even or odd, the prisoners’ joint answers are either all correct (even case) or all incorrect (odd case). Either outcome satisfies the warden’s condition for release.

Step 5 – Why the warden cannot spoil it  
The warden hears the strategy but can only choose the hat placement. Whatever placement he chooses has a definite parity, and the analysis above shows that parity forces the prisoners’ guesses to be uniformly right or uniformly wrong. Hence the warden has no counter-move.

Final answer: Each prisoner counts the number of black hats he can see. If that number is even he guesses his own hat is white; if it is odd he guesses it is black. This guarantees that either all guesses are correct (when the total number of black hats is even) or all guesses are incorrect (when the total number of black hats is odd), so the prisoners always go free.",True

Given the following information, what will each son get?
1, Derek will not get The Golden Pleasure unless Berrick gets The Silver Dream and Eric gets The Rusting Bucket.
2, Berrick will not get The Rusting Bucket unless Merick gets The Devine Lightning and Derek gets The Silver Dream.

1.  Translate every statement “X will not get Y unless ( … )” into the implication  
   X gets Y  ⇒  (the listed conditions).

2.  Write the nine implications.

   (1) D GP ⇒ (B SD ∧ E RB)  
   (2) B RB ⇒ (M DL ∧ D SD)  
   (3) E DL ⇒ (D GP ∧ B SD)  
   (4) D SD ⇒ (M DL ∧ E RB)  
   (5) B SD ⇒ (D DL ∧ E RB)  
   (6) D DL ⇒ (B GP ∧ M SD)  
   (7) M DL ⇒ (B GP ∧ D RB)  
   (8) D RB ⇒ (B DL ∧ E GP)  
   (9) M SD ⇒ (E GP)

   (D = Derek, B = Berrick, M = Merick, E = Eric;  
   GP = Golden Pleasure, SD = Silver Dream, DL = Devine Lightning, RB = Rusting Bucket.)

3.  First elimination:  
   Suppose Eric had the Devine Lightning (E DL).  
   From (3): D GP and B SD.  
   But (5) says B SD ⇒ D DL, forcing Derek to have both GP and DL – impossible.  
   Therefore E DL is impossible. Eric cannot have the Devine Lightning.

4.  Try Merick with the Devine Lightning (M DL).  
   From (7): B GP and D RB.  
   Then (8) applies (because D RB): B DL and E GP.  
   Now B would have to be both GP and DL – impossible.  
   Hence M DL is impossible.

5.  Try Derek with the Devine Lightning (D DL).  
   From (6): B GP and M SD.  
   From (9) (because M SD): E GP.  
   But each car is unique, so GP can’t go to both B and E.  
   Therefore D DL is impossible.

6.  The only remaining possibility for the Devine Lightning is Berrick: B DL.

7.  With B DL in place, consider Derek’s car.

   • If Derek had GP, implication (1) would force B SD, contradicting B DL.  
   • If Derek had SD, implication (4) would force M DL, already impossible.  
   Therefore Derek must have RB.  So D RB.

8.  Having D RB, implication (8) gives B DL (already so) and E GP.  So E GP.

9.  The only car left for Merick is the Silver Dream: M SD.  
   Check (9): M SD ⇒ E GP – already satisfied.

10.  All other antecedents are now false, so every implication is satisfied.  
    No contradiction exists, and all cars are uniquely assigned.

The unique distribution is:

• Derek – Rusting Bucket  
• Berrick – Devine Lightning  
• Eric – Golden Pleasure  
• Merick – Silver Dream

193,"Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...
 Hint: nan",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

A “blow” on lantern i toggles the state (lit ↔ out) of lanterns

Because blowing twice on the same lantern has no net effect (toggle-toggle = do-nothing), we only have to know whether each lantern is blown on an even (0) or odd (1) number of times.  
Write

 xi = 1  if lantern i is blown on an odd number of times.

Starting position: every lantern is lit (state = 1).  
Desired position: every lantern is out (state = 0).

For every lantern j the total number of blows that affect it is

 xj-1 + xj + xj+1  (mod 2).

We need this total to be 1 (so a lit lantern is toggled once) for every j:

 xj-1 + xj + xj+1 = 1  for j = 0,1,…,6.  (1)

That gives the linear system (all arithmetic mod 2)

 x6 + x0 + x1 = 1  
 x0 + x1 + x2 = 1  
 x1 + x2 + x3 = 1  
 x2 + x3 + x4 = 1  
 x3 + x4 + x5 = 1  
 x4 + x5 + x6 = 1  
 x5 + x6 + x0 = 1.

Solve it:

1. Subtract (second) – (first): x2 + x6 = 0 ⇒ x2 = x6.  
2. From the third: x3 = 1 + x1 + x2 = 1 + x1 + x6.  
3. From the fourth: x4 = 1 + x2 + x3 = 1 + x6 + (1 + x1 + x6) = x1.  
4. Fifth: x5 = 1 + x3 + x4 = 1 + (1 + x1 + x6) + x1 = x6.  
5. Sixth: x1 + x5 + x6 = 1 ⇒ x1 + x6 + x6 = 1 ⇒ x1 = 1.  
6. Seventh: x5 + x6 + x0 = 1 ⇒ x6 + x6 + x0 = 1 ⇒ x0 = 1.  
7. Then x6 = x2 = 1, x3 = x0 = 1, x4 = x1 = 1, x5 = x6 = 1.

Hence

 x0 = x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = x5 = x6 = 1.

Every lantern must be blown on once (and only once) to reach the all-out state.  Any lantern skipped (xi = 0) or blown on twice (xi = 0 mod 2) violates at least one equation.

Conclusion  
• It is possible to extinguish all seven lanterns.  
• The minimum number of blows is seven.  
• A valid (in fact, the only) plan is: walk around the circle and blow on every lantern exactly once, in any order.

After the seventh blow each lantern has been toggled three times (by itself and its two neighbours) – an odd number – so all end up out.

Final answer: Blow once on each of the seven jack-o’-lanterns (seven blows total, in any order); this is the only way to guarantee that all are extinguished.",True

B = blue, K = black, G = green, R = red, Y = yellow.

Write every daily choice as an unordered pair of colours.  
We must arrange seven different pairs (Monday → Sunday) that satisfy

1. no pair is repeated,
2. a colour never appears on two consecutive days,
3. one colour is used on exactly four days,
4. Monday is {B,K},
5. Thursday contains G,
6. Friday contains no Y,
7. no pair contains {R,K}.

Step 1 Start with the fixed information  

Mon : {B , K}

Step 2 Choose a Thursday pair containing G that will allow a legal Friday pair.

Let Thu = {G , S}.  
Because of rule 2, Friday cannot contain G or S; because of rule 6, Friday also cannot contain Y.  
Thus Friday must come from {B, R, K} \ {S}.  
Since {R,K} is forbidden and {B,K} would duplicate Monday, the only way Friday can work is if
 S = K  and  Fri = {B , R} .

So we set  

Thu : {G , K}  
Fri : {B , R}

Step 3 Fill Tuesday and Wednesday.

Tuesday cannot use B or K (rule 2 with Monday), so pick the two remaining colours
 Tue = {G , R} .

Wednesday must avoid G and R (rule 2 with Tuesday) and also K (rule 2 with Thursday); the only two permissible colours are B and Y, giving

 Wed = {B , Y} .

All four pairs so far are distinct.

Step 4 Plan to make one colour appear four times.  
Blue has already appeared on Mon, Wed, Fri (3 times).  
We will let it appear once more on Sunday to reach the required four.

Step 5 Choose Saturday and Sunday.

Friday is {B,R}, so Saturday cannot contain B or R.  
The two remaining colours not yet paired together are K and Y, yielding

 Sat = {K , Y} .

Sunday must avoid K and Y and must contain B (to give B its 4th appearance).  
The only unused, legal pair is

 Sun = {B , G} .

Step 6 Verify everything.

Pairs:
Mon {B,K}; Tue {G,R}; Wed {B,Y}; Thu {G,K}; Fri {B,R}; Sat {K,Y}; Sun {B,G}

• All 7 pairs are different.  
• No colour repeats on consecutive days.  
• Blue appears exactly 4 times (Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun).  
• Thursday contains green; Friday contains no yellow.  
• No pair is {R,K}.  
All conditions are satisfied.

Hence Peter’s colours on Saturday are black and yellow.

Final answer: black and yellow",True
195,"Question: At the Christmas party of the ""Sweaty Chef"" kebab shop, the owner Mr Juan, took note of how many people were present. Although he was a bit tipsy when he made his note, and thus made a mistake.  His notes were as follows:-
1, There were 9 men and children.
2, There were 2 more women than children.
3, The number of different man-woman couples possible was 24. Note that if there were 7 men and 5 women, then there would have been 35 man-woman couples possible.
Also, of the three groups - men, women and children - at the party:
4, There were 4 of one group.
5, There were 6 of one group.
6, There were 8 of one group.
Exactly one of the above 6 statements is false.
Can you tell which one is false? Also, how many men, women and children are there at the party?
 Hint: nan",,"Statement (4) is false. There are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children.
Assume that Statements (4), (5) and (6) are all true. Then, Statement (1) is false. But then Statement (2) and (3) both can not be true. Thus, contradictory to the fact that exactly one statement is false.
So Statement (4) or Statement (5) or Statement (6) is false. Also, Statements (1), (2) and (3) all are true.
From (1) and (2), there are 11 men and women. Then from (3), there are 2 possible cases - either there are 8 men and 3 women or there are 3 men and 8 women.
If there are 8 men and 3 women, then there is 1 child. Then Statements (4) and (5) both are false, which is not possible.
Hence, there are 3 men, 8 women and 6 children. Statement (4) is false.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

M = number of men  
W = number of women  
C = number of children  

Write the six statements algebraically:

1) M + C = 9  
2) W = C + 2  
3) M·W = 24  
4) one of M, W, C equals 4  
5) one of M, W, C equals 6  
6) one of M, W, C equals 8  

Exactly one of the six statements is wrong.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Assume the numerical statements 1–3 are true  
(then at most one of 4–6 can be false).

From 1 and 2: M = 9 – C and W = C + 2  

Substitute in 3:

(9 – C)(C + 2) = 24  
⇒ 7C + 18 – C² = 24  
⇒ –C² + 7C – 6 = 0  
⇒ C² – 7C + 6 = 0  
⇒ (C – 6)(C – 1) = 0

Thus C = 6 or C = 1.

Case A: C = 6  
 then W = 8, M = 3.

Case B: C = 1  
 then W = 3, M = 8.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 – Check statements 4–6 for each case

Case A (M, W, C) = (3, 8, 6)

4) “There were 4 of one group’’ → false (no group has 4).  
5) “There were 6 of one group’’ → true (children).  
6) “There were 8 of one group’’ → true (women).

Exactly one statement (No. 4) is false.

Case B (M, W, C) = (8, 3, 1)

4) false (no 4)  
5) false (no 6)  

Here two statements are false, contradicting the condition.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Conclusion

Only Case A satisfies the requirement that exactly one statement is wrong, and the single wrong statement is No. 4.

 Hint: nan",,"A) There are five boys prior to the median, meaning that there are three boys in each of the first two rows.  If the first boy is at location 4, then there could only be two boys in the first row.  The first boy must be located before position 4, therefore a girl must occupy: 28 (clue 7).

199,"Question: I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.
 Hint: nan",,"Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

 Serving & lose = –1  Receiving & lose = –2  

The winner of a round serves the next round.

Round 1  
I (M) serve.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 1 M wins round 1  
Cards: 5 + 2 = 7 (M serves round 2)

 Round 2  
 a) M wins → 9 cards. Even if M then loses (–1) or wins (+2) round 3, he finishes with 8 or 11 cards – not 4.  
 b) M loses → 7 – 1 = 6 cards. T now serves.

  Round 3  
  • M wins (+1) → 7 cards.  
  • M loses (–2) → 4 cards.  (sequence W L L for M)

So Case 1 yields exactly one valid sequence:  
M wins R1, T wins R2, T wins R3.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 2 M loses round 1  
Cards: 5 – 1 = 4 (T serves round 2)

 Round 2

200,"Question: Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?
 Hint: nan",,"Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-by-step reasoning  

1.  Phil is “watching” what is happening in the town of MADADIA from the upstairs bedroom.  
    The wording does not say he is looking out of the window; it only says he is watching it.  

2.  Everything described about MADADIA is patently absurd:  
       • A “yearly Kebab harvest” (kebabs are cooked, not grown or harvested).  
       • An uninterrupted month-long cloudburst that has put six feet of water inside every
         house, yet the townsfolk are merely “upstairs” instead of having evacuated.  
    These impossible details signal that the town is fictional.  

3.  The hint is “nan”.  In many programming languages the symbol NaN stands for
    “Not a Number” – i.e. something that does not exist as a real numerical value.
    The hint is nudging us toward the idea that MADADIA itself is “not real.”  

4.  Put together, the clues indicate that Phil is not looking at real life at all; he is
    watching a computer game or other simulation that he created or is playing in his
    bedroom.  (MADADIA is the whimsical name he gave the simulated town.)  

5.  Norma therefore “could really care less” because there is no genuine disaster going on
    – it is only pixels on a screen.  She knows it is a game, so she refuses to take his
    warnings seriously.  

Conclusion  
Norma doesn’t care about the flood because the whole catastrophe is happening only inside the computer game/virtual simulation Phil is watching, not in the real world.",True
201,"Question: There were 9 portraits of animals (bear, cat, dog, hamster, horse, lion, monkey, mouse, and tiger) on a wall of a museum.

We label the wall positions as a 3 × 3 grid

         A      B      C
   1   1A    1B    1C
   2   2A    2B    2C
   3   3A    3B    3C
(row 1 is the top row).

1)  From clue 4, place the dog in 2A.

2)  Clue 6 says the monkey is either above or below the dog, so the monkey must be in 1A or 3A.

3)  Clue 3 says the horse is in the same row as the monkey.  
    Try monkey in 3A (below the dog).  
    Then horse must also be in row 3.

4)  Clue 2 tells us row 3 contains two animals whose names begin with the same letter.  
    Among the remaining animals the only identical-initial pairs are  
      (hamster, horse) and (monkey, mouse).  
    Because horse is already in row 3, the only way to have a duplicated initial in that row and still leave room for the monkey is to use the pair (monkey, mouse).  
    Thus row 3 must contain monkey, mouse, horse.

5)  Clue 2 also says column C must contain two animals with the same initial.  
    Since row 3 already contains horse, put the horse in 3C; then some other H-animal (the hamster) must be somewhere else in column C to give the required duplicate initial.

6)  Put the hamster in 1C (column C, row 1).  
    Clue 1 requires the bear to be in the same row as the hamster, so place the bear in 1A.

7)  That leaves one empty spot in row 1,  namely 1B.  
    From clue 5, the cat must have either a lion or a tiger directly beneath it, so put the cat in 1B; then one of (lion, tiger) must go in 2B.

8)  Clue 7 forbids the tiger from being next to the dog (dog is in 2A, so 2B cannot be tiger).  
    Therefore 2B is lion and 2C is tiger.

9)  The only remaining empty place is 3B, which belongs to the mouse (established in step 4).

The completed wall is therefore:

         A          B          C
   1   Bear      Cat       Hamster
   2   Dog       Lion      Tiger
   3   Monkey    Mouse     Horse

All seven clues are satisfied, so this is the unique solution.

202,"Question: In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.

Remember that only one statement can be true.

If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

W⁺  = a wage increase  
W⁻  = a wage decrease  
S⁺  = a subsidy increase  
S⁻  = a subsidy decrease  
T⁺  = a tax   increase  
T⁻  = a tax   decrease  

Only one of these six events is actually going to happen.

The Minister makes three statements and is known to tell the truth exactly once in every set of three statements.  
Label his three statements

S₁ : “It’s about subsidies.”  
S₂ : “Nothing is going down.”  
S₃ : “Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.”

Translate each statement into conditions on the six events:

S₁ is true ⇔ (S⁺ or S⁻).  
S₂ is true ⇔ (W⁺ or S⁺ or T⁺).        (no decrease occurs)  
S₃ is true ⇔ (S⁻ or W⁺).               (a disjunction)

Now check each of the six possible events and count how many of S₁,S₂,S₃ are true.

1. W⁺ :  S₁ F, S₂ T, S₃ T  → 2 truths (not allowed)  
2. W⁻ :  S₁ F, S₂ F, S₃ F  → 0 truths (not allowed)  
3. S⁺ :  S₁ T, S₂ T, S₃ F  → 2 truths (not allowed)  
4. S⁻ :  S₁ T, S₂ F, S₃ T  → 2 truths (not allowed)  
5. T⁺ :  S₁ F, S₂ T, S₃ F  → 1 truth  (allowed)  
6. T⁻ :  S₁ F, S₂ F, S₃ F  → 0 truths (not allowed)

Exactly one event, T⁺, yields the required pattern of “one true, two false.”

203,"Question: There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?
 Hint: By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"We may view the game as the classic “take-away” game with a heap of 2008 eggs and a legal move set  
S = {1, 2, … , 100}.  A standard winning idea for such games is to leave the opponent a heap whose size is a multiple of one more than the maximum move, i.e. a multiple of 101.

Why that works  
If after your turn the pile has a multiple of 101 eggs, then whatever number x (1 ≤ x ≤ 100) your opponent removes, you can always remove 101 − x (which is again between 1 and 100).  
Thus each pair of turns eliminates exactly 101 eggs, so after 101, 202, 303, … eggs disappear the pile is still a multiple of 101 and it is your move again. Eventually, when 101 eggs remain, the opponent must take x (1–100) and you immediately take the remaining 101 − x eggs and win.

Therefore the whole problem reduces to this:

Choose an initial move k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) such that  
2008 − k ≡ 0 (mod 101).

Compute 2008 mod 101  
101·19 = 1919  
2008 − 1919 = 89 ⇒ 2008 ≡ 89 (mod 101).

Hence we need k ≡ 89 (mod 101).  
The only such k in the allowed range 1–100 is k = 89.

Verification  
After taking 89 eggs, 2008 − 89 = 1919 = 101·19 are left.  
From then on play the “complement to 101’’ reply every turn; this guarantees the last move.

 Hint: nan",,"Adam was a Muslim, Ben was a Christian and Cyril was a Jew. Adam was born in 1309 of the Muslim calendar, Ben 1310 in the Christian calendar and Cyril 1311 in the Jewish calendar. Cyril was born over 3000 years before Ben, who in turn was born 619 years before Adam.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"1.  If Adam, Ben and Cyril really were three people, the story makes no sense.  
    •  They were “born” only one year apart.  
    •  They spent more than sixty years on the very same road.  
    •  Old Jerusalem’s streets are not enormous; in that length of time neighbours are bound to see each other.  
    Therefore the riddle must be talking about something that cannot move.

2.  Notice the “years” 1309, 1310 and 1311.  
    •  They look like ordinary consecutive numbers rather than historical dates.  
    •  Consecutive numbers on a road are far more likely to be house numbers than years of birth.

3.  Re-interpret the statements with that in mind.  
    •  “Born” = built (the date the building was put up).  
    •  “Lived their whole life there” = the building has never been moved.  
    •  “All lived to be over 60 and had a full active life” = the buildings have stood for more than sixty years and have been in continuous use.  
    •  “Never crossed paths with each other” = buildings are immovable objects; they can never meet or “cross paths”.

4.  So Adam, Ben and Cyril are simply three houses (or shops) standing at numbers 1309, 1310 and 1311 on the same street in old Jerusalem.  Being fixed to the ground, they can stand side by side for centuries and still never “meet”.

A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick.

The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club.

Unfortunately the TV program started at that point so he never actually got around to doing it. Can you find the two possible solutions to Mad Ade's clock teaser?
 Hint: nan",,"Imagining the number on a clock face in a clockwise order they would be
1 2 3 4 7 10 9 8 5 6 11 12
Or
1 2 3 4 9 10 7 6 5 8 11 12",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1.  The “all–adjacent–sums prime” condition forces an
even / odd alternation  
Except for 2, every prime is odd.  
To make the sum of two neighbouring clock numbers prime, the two numbers
have to be of opposite parity.  
Because the clock contains six evens and six odds, every feasible
arrangement must run

even – odd – even – odd – … – (twelve times).

Step 2.  Look at the original clock face

…… 11 – 12 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7 – 8 – 9 – 10 – 11 ……

and write down the sums of neighbours

12+1 = 13   prime  
1+2 = 3     prime  
2+3 = 5     prime  
3+4 = 7     prime  
4+5 = 9     non-prime ←  
5+6 = 11    prime  
6+7 = 13    prime  
7+8 = 15    non-prime ←  
8+9 = 17    prime  
9+10 = 19   prime  
10+11 = 21  non-prime ←  
11+12 = 23  prime  

The only three offending edges are (4,5), (7,8) and (10,11).

Step 3.  Which six consecutive positions may stay untouched?  
If we freeze a block of six adjoining numbers, the five neighbour pairs
inside that block have to be prime already, so none of the edges (4,5),
(7,8), (10,11) can lie inside that block.

Checking the twelve possible blocks shows that the one and only legal
block is

11 – 12 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 .

Consequently the other six positions (where we are allowed to reshuffle
the numbers) are the places that originally carry

5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10.

Step 4.  Parity of the six movable places  
The fixed part ends with 4 (even) and starts again with 11 (odd), so the
free half must read

odd – even – odd – even – odd – even

in order to keep the global even/odd alternation.  
Hence

positions 5,7,9 have to contain 5,7,9 (the three odds)  
positions 6,8,10 have to contain 6,8,10 (the three evens).

Step 5.  Prepare a little “compatibility table”

Odd 5 pairs primely with 6 or 8.  
Odd 7 pairs primely with 4, 6 or 10.  
Odd 9 pairs primely with 4, 8 or 10.  
Even 6 pairs primely with 5 or 7.  
Even 8 pairs primely with 5 or 9.  
Even 10 pairs primely with 7 or 9.  

Step 6.  Build the free half, beginning next to the fixed 4

• 4 must be followed by an odd that gives a prime sum with 4  
  – possibilities: 7 or 9.

Case A : start with 7

4 – 7 – ? – ? – ? – ? – 11

4-7 ok.  7 must be followed by 6 or 10.

 A1  …7-6… fails (the last edge 6-11 is 17 but an earlier edge 10-11 later
    became 21).  
 A2  …7-10-9-8-5-6 succeeds:

216,"Question: There are 10 people who could be the owner of the bank. They all sit in separate chairs across a long table facing north. The table is made of aluminium. The owner of the bank sits next to M. M sits on the left side of the banker. M sits next to C. C sits 4 places to the left of L. L sits next to O and rarely talks to S, E or Z, because they hate him and because they sit on the far right of the bank. O does not sit next to the owner of the bank. The two people left are F and T. T hates the owner of the bank and is considering resigning. Give the names of all the bankers from left to right.
 Hint: Think from the banker's point of view and draw a diagram.",Think from the banker's point of view and draw a diagram.,TCMBFLOSEZ.,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the ten seats be numbered 1 (extreme left / west) through 10 (extreme right / east).  
Everyone is facing north, so a person’s left–hand neighbour is the seat with the next lower
number.

The names that appear in the statement are  

 M, C, L, O, S, E, Z, F, T  

and the one remaining person is the Owner of the bank – call him B.

Step-by-step placement

1.  “M sits on the left side of the banker and the banker sits next to M.”  
    Hence three consecutive seats must be … C?  
    First write what the two sentences tell us:  
    – B has M immediately to his left ⇒ … M B…  
    – M is next to the banker ⇒ nothing more, we already have adjacency.

2.  “M sits next to C.”  
    M already has B on his right, so C must be immediately to M’s left:  
     … C M B …

3.  “C sits 4 places to the left of L.”  
    Therefore if C is in seat k, L must be in seat k + 4.  
    Trying every possible position of the triple C M B (while keeping the table 10 seats
    long and leaving room for L four seats to the right) leaves only two feasible
    locations:

           Case A Seats 1–3 :  C1  M2  B3 ⇒ L is in seat 5
           Case B Seats 2–4 :  C2  M3  B4 ⇒ L is in seat 6

    Any further to the right would force L into seat 8, 9 or 10, but those three seats have
    to be occupied by S, E and Z (see step 5), so no other placement works.

4.  “L sits next to O” and “O does not sit next to the owner of the bank.”  
    •  In Case A (L in seat 5) O can only go into seat 6 (seat 4 would put O next to B in
       seat 3, which is forbidden).  
    •  In Case B (L in seat 6) O can only go into seat 7 (seat 5 would again put O next to
       the owner in seat 4).

5.  “S, E and Z … sit on the far right of the bank.”  
    Interpret “far right” naturally as the three right-hand-most seats, i.e. seats 8, 9 and 10.
    (Their internal order is irrelevant – only the fact that the three seats are reserved
    for them matters.)

    With seats 8–10 fixed for {S,E,Z}, Case B is still possible (O went to seat 7, the last
    free place before the block 8–10).  
    Case A is also still possible.

6.  All that remains to be placed are F and T, and we are told exactly that:
    “The two people left are F and T. T hates the owner of the bank.”  
    We simply keep T from sitting next to B.

    •  Case A (so far 1 C 2 M 3 B 5 L 6 O 8–10 S/E/Z)  
       The empty seats are 4 and 7.  
       Seat 4 is next to the owner, seat 7 is not.  
       Hence 4 F, 7 T.

    •  Case B (so far 2 C 3 M 4 B 6 L 7 O 8–10 S/E/Z)  
       The empty seats are 1 and 5.  
       Seat 5 is next to the owner, seat 1 is not.  
       Hence 1 T, 5 F.

    Both partial diagrams satisfy every given condition; the only difference is which of
    the two admissible ways we chose to seat the initial block C M B.

Because the exact order of S, E and Z on the far-right three chairs is not stated (and does
not affect any other rule) we may list them in any order; likewise either of the two
complete layouts works.  A perfectly valid seating, reading from left to right, is therefore

Seat 1   C  
Seat 2   M  
Seat 3   B (the Owner)  
Seat 4   F  
Seat 5   L  
Seat 6   O  
Seat 7   T  
Seat 8   S  
Seat 9   E  
Seat 10  Z  

Thus the bankers, left-to-right, can be read as

217,"Question: You and your spouse invite four other couples to a party. During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present. Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?
 Hint: nan",,"Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person. Discounting yourself, everyone knows a different number of people, which means that (again, discounting yourself) one person knows one, one person knows two, one person knows three, etc., up to one person who knows nine people (everybody else). Number the people (besides yourself) according to how many people they know, so that person 1 is the one who knows one person, person 2 is the one who knows two people, etc.
Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only one of those not yet paired up is person 6, so person 4 and person 6 must be married.
This leaves person 5, who knows everyone except persons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These five people, therefore, must be persons 6, 7, 8, 9, and you. Since you are the only one of these five not yet paired up, person 5 must be your spouse. So your spouse knew five people prior to the party.
The above also determines that the people who know you are persons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So you knew five people prior to the party also.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the ten people at the party be the vertices of a graph.
For every two people who were acquainted before the party we draw an (undirected) edge, so that the degree of a vertex is the number of people that person already knew.

Facts that are given or obvious  

•  There are 5 married couples; call the partners of a couple “spouses”.  
•  Acquaintance is symmetric, so degrees really count the number of edges incident with a vertex.  
•  Every person knows his or her own spouse, so everyone has degree ≥1.  
•  Of the other nine people (everybody except you) the degrees are all different.

Step 1 – which nine different numbers can occur?  
Since every degree is at least 1, the only possible distinct degrees for the nine other people are  

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 .

Step 2 – the extreme degrees must be spouses  

Let A be the person whose degree is 9 and B the person whose degree is 1.  
Because B knows exactly one person, that person has to be B’s spouse.  
If A were not B’s spouse, then B would not know A; by symmetry A would not know B either, contradicting the fact that A knows everybody.  
Hence the degree-9 person and the degree-1 person are a married couple.

Step 3 – remove that couple and repeat  

Delete A and B from consideration.  
Among the eight remaining people the smallest degree is 2 and the largest is 8; the same argument shows that the degree-8 person and degree-2 person must be spouses.  
Delete them and continue:

degree-7 is married to degree-3,  
degree-6 is married to degree-4.

After removing these four couples, only one couple is left, namely you and your spouse, and the only unused degree is 5.  Therefore both you and your spouse must have degree 5.

Conclusion  

Your spouse knew 5 of the 9 other people, and (perhaps to your own surprise) you also knew exactly 5 of them.

The little clue 'June is in her prime' should have helped, as it suggests that all the numbers in her name are prime numbers.  As the total is 17 all the numbers must be less than 10, so:
J=2; U=7; N=5; E=3  (or J=3; U=7; N=5; E=2)
Setting these numbers in the word Jane or Jean we can conclude that
16=2+A+5+3, so A=6.
Putting these numbers in the word Jenny in the same way we find Y=4.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step-1.  Name every different letter with a variable  

 J, A, N, E, U, Y are the six different letters that occur in the four names.

Step-2.  Translate the four statements “the sum of the letters equals the age”

 June  J + U + N + E = 17                (1)  
 Jenny J + E + N + N + Y = 19 → J + E + 2N + Y = 19 (2)  
 Jane  J + A + N + E = 16                (3)  
 Jean  J + E + A + N = 16 – same as (3)

Step-3.  Eliminate to obtain simple relations

 Subtract (1) from (3): A − U = −1 ⇒ A = U − 1       (4)  
 Subtract (1) from (2): N + Y − U = 2 ⇒ Y = U + 2 − N  (5)

Step-4.  Use the hint “prime”

 June is 17 (a prime), and the hint suggests taking the letters of JUNE to be primes.  
 We need four different primes whose sum is 17.  
 The only possible set is 2, 3, 5, 7 because  

  2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17

 Consequently       {J, U, N, E} is a permutation of {2, 3, 5, 7}.

Step-5.  Try every choice for U and enforce the relations (4) and (5)

 • U = 2 ⇒ A = 1, N + Y = 4  
  N must be 3, 5 or 7 – none of them gives a new, positive Y different from every other letter.  
  (If N = 5 we get Y = −1, which is allowed but gives a negative value.  
   We are after positive ages, so discard this case.)

 • U = 3 ⇒ A = 2, N + Y = 5  
  The only way N + Y = 5 with unused numbers is N = 7, Y = −2 (negative again).  
  Discard.

 • U = 5 ⇒ A = 4, N + Y = 7  
  N = 2 gives Y = 5 (clashes with U); N = 3 gives Y = 4 (clashes with A);  
  N = 7 gives Y = 0 (zero not allowed).  Discard.

 • U = 7 ⇒ A = 6, N + Y = 9  
  N can be 5 (then Y = 4) – all values are positive and different.  
  This choice works.

So we must have

 U = 7, A = 6, N = 5, Y = 4.

Step-6.  Determine J and E

With U = 7 and N = 5 equation (1) gives

 J + E = 17 − (U + N) = 17 − 12 = 5.

The only two unused numbers left are 2 and 3, and indeed 2 + 3 = 5.  
Either letter may take either value:

 Case I J = 2, E = 3  
 Case II J = 3, E = 2

Both satisfy every requirement, and all six letters have different non-zero integers.

Hence the two possible complete assignments are

 Case I J = 2, A = 6, N = 5, E = 3, U = 7, Y = 4  
 Case II J = 3, A = 6, N = 5, E = 2, U = 7, Y = 4

They give the correct ages:

 June 7 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 17, or 7 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 17  
 Jenny 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 19, or 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 19  
 Jane/Jean 2 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 16, or 3 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 16.

Therefore there are exactly two (mirror-image) solutions.

Final answer: The letters can be valued either

 B = A + 1              (Kevin wins once more than Kate)

 x = 1 : largest initial amount = 24  
 x = 2 : largest initial amount = 25

Thus the greatest possible amount anyone could have had in the desk on 3 March occurs when x = 4 (19 winning days: Kate 4, Kevin 5, Kathy 10, and 2 no-win days).  In that case Kate started with \$27, Kevin with \$24 and Kathy with \$9.

All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.

A) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.
B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.
Robby O'Mental:

There are eight statements in all; the problem states that exactly three are true and five are false.

Extra information from the story  
“All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape.”  
So every guard, Morris included, hoped for the escape; therefore

Case 1.  D = Norris  
Truth values:  
Norris A (F), Norris B (F), Nobby A (T), Nobby B (T), Morris A (F), Robby A (T)  
So far 3 T and 3 F; the two remaining statements are Morris B (H) and Robby B (S).  
Because of (1) Morris B is True, giving already 4 true statements—too many.  
Hence D ≠ Norris.

Case 2.  D = Nobby  
Truth values:  
Norris A (T), Norris B (F), Nobby A (F), Nobby B (F), Morris A (T), Robby A (T)  
Again 3 T and 3 F before considering Morris B and Robby B.  
Morris B is True by (1), so we again get at least 4 true statements—too many.  
Hence D ≠ Nobby.

Case 3.  D = Morris  
Truth values:  
Norris A (T), Norris B (T), Nobby A (T), Nobby B (F), Morris A (F), Robby A (T)  
Already 4 true statements (and only two left to look at), impossible.  
Hence D ≠ Morris.

Case 4.  D = Robby  
Truth values:  
Norris A (T), Norris B (F), Nobby A (T), Nobby B (F), Morris A (F), Robby A (F)  
That is 2 T and 4 F so far.  
Morris B is True by (1), making 3 T and 4 F.  
To reach the required total of three true statements, Robby B must be false, i.e.  

S = False (Robby actually was surprised).  

This gives exactly 3 true and 5 false statements, satisfying all the conditions.

Since only this last case works, Robby O’Mental was the guard on duty and the one who left the door open.

Mother: “Exactly three of my sons are telling the truth.”

Step 1.  Observe the logical relations.

• S₄ is the statement “S₁ and S₂ have opposite truth values.”  
• S₅ says S₄ is false, so S₅ = ¬S₄.  
 Therefore S₄ and S₅ can never be both true or both false; exactly one of them is true.

Step 2.  Count truths.

Because S₄ and S₅ contribute one truth and one lie, the remaining three statements (S₁, S₂, S₃) must contribute two truths and one lie to make the required total of three truths.

Step 3.  Analyse S₃.

S₃ claims “S₁ is false AND S₂ is false.”

• If S₃ were true, then S₁ and S₂ would both be false.  
 That would make among {S₁, S₂, S₃} exactly one truth and two lies, contradicting the need for two truths.

Since S₃ is false, the conjunction “S₁ false AND S₂ false” is false; therefore at least one of S₁, S₂ is true.

But we already need exactly two truths among {S₁, S₂, S₃}, and S₃ is false; thus both S₁ and S₂ must be true.

Step 5.  Evaluate S₄ and S₅.

Because S₁ and S₂ are both true, 0 of them are lying.  
• S₄ (“exactly one of them is lying”) is therefore false.  
• S₅ (¬S₄) is true.  

The truth distribution is now:

True : S₁, S₂, S₅  (3 truths)  
False: S₃, S₄    (2 lies)

This satisfies Mother’s condition.

Step 6.  Identify the culprit from S₁ and S₂ being true.

S₁ true  ⇒ the culprit is Pete or Tom.  
S₂ true  ⇒ the culprit is not Pete and not George.  

Combining these, the only possible culprit is Tom.

All statements are now consistent with the required truth pattern, so the assignment is valid.

Since A+B+C=9, none of them can be 9, and GHIJ must be 9753, and one of A, B, C is 1.
The other two add up to 8, which is obtained by 8+0.
Therefore, A, the biggest number of the three, is 8.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1  ‑  possible patterns for DEF  
D,E,F must be consecutive even digits in decreasing order.  
Even digits are 0,2,4,6,8, so the only possible triples are  
• 8-6-4  • 6-4-2  • 4-2-0

Step 2  ‑  possible patterns for GHIJ  
G,H,I,J must be four consecutive odd digits in decreasing order.  
Odd digits are 1,3,5,7,9, so the only possible quadruples are  
• 9-7-5-3  • 7-5-3-1

Step 3  ‑  choose DEF and GHIJ and see what is left for A,B,C  
A,B,C must be in decreasing order and satisfy A + B + C = 9.  
All ten digits must be different.

Case 1 : DEF = 8-6-4  
 a) GHIJ = 9-7-5-3 ⟹ remaining digits {0,1,2}.  Their largest possible sum is 3, < 9.  
 b) GHIJ = 7-5-3-1 ⟹ remaining digits {0,2,9}.  The only decreasing arrangement is 9-2-0, whose sum is 11 ≠ 9.  
 No solution here.

Case 2 : DEF = 6-4-2  
 a) GHIJ = 9-7-5-3 ⟹ remaining digits {0,1,8}.  
  The only decreasing triple is 8-1-0, and 8 + 1 + 0 = 9.  Perfect – this works.  
 b) GHIJ = 7-5-3-1 ⟹ remaining digits {0,8,9}.  No way to make a decreasing triple summing to 9.  
 So the only valid choice in this case is  ABC = 8-1-0.

Case 3 : DEF = 4-2-0  
 Try each GHIJ choice; in both sub-cases the remaining three digits cannot form a decreasing triple summing to 9.  
 Therefore no solution here either.

1.  Mum married Husband #1.  
    •  They had two girls, Ann and Beth.  

2.  Mum and Husband #1 divorced, but he has always stayed in the children’s lives and is still called “Dad” by anyone who wants to.

3.  Mum married Husband #2.  
    •  They had two more children, Carl (the narrator, the middle child) and Dana.  
    •  After some years Mum and Husband #2 also divorced.  Like Husband #1 he still visits often and is still “Dad” to the children who know him.

4.  Mum married Husband #3 (her present husband).  
    •  They had one more daughter, Eva.  
    •  Husband #3 lives elsewhere at the moment because of work, but he is very much part of the family and the children all call him “Dad” too.

Which “Dad(s)” each child has
•  Carl, Dana and Eva have all three men in their lives, so each of them quite naturally says “I have three dads.”  
•  Ann and Beth never regarded Husband #2 as a father-figure – he came after they had gone to live with their own dad for a while – so they see only Husband #1 (their biological father) and Husband #3 (their current step-dad) as dads.  Hence “only two dads.”

Who lives in the house now
•  Mum  
•  Ann (now a young adult)  
•  Beth  
•  Carl (the narrator)  
•  Dana  
•  Eva  
•  Ann’s little boy, Frank               ←  the nephew mentioned in the hint

That is 7 people living under the same roof, exactly as stated.

So:
•  Carl can truthfully say he has 3 dads.  
•  He really does have 4 sisters.  
•  Two of those sisters have only 2 dads.  
•  The household contains exactly 7 people, one of whom is his nephew.  

All conditions in the riddle are satisfied by a completely ordinary sequence of divorces, remarriages and an older sister who already has a child.

Final answer:  The children all share the same mother, but their mother has been married three times.  Each husband is still “Dad” to the children who know him, so the narrator and two of the girls have three dads (their own biological father plus two stepfathers), while the two oldest girls know only two of the men as fathers.

225,"Question: There are three brothers: Al, Ben, and Carl. Two of the three brothers are boxers. Here are some facts:

2. The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.
3. The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.
Which brother is not a boxer?
 Hint: nan",,"Carl is not a boxer.
From fact 1, we know that Carl is not the older boxer.
From fact 3, we know that Ben is not the younger boxer.
We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.
If scenario 2 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al; fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al, making Ben shorter than Carl.
If scenario 3 is true, fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al.
We can now expand our three scenarios:
1. Al is the younger, taller boxer, and Ben is the older, shorter boxer.
2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.
Fact 2 also tells us that Al is not the shorter boxer, so scenario 3 cannot be possible, either.
Therefore, scenario 1 is true, which means that Carl is not a boxer.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

• OB  = the Older of the two boxers  
• YB  = the Younger of the two boxers  
• SB  = the Shorter of the two boxers  
• TB  = the Taller of the two boxers  

Because there are exactly two boxers, the four symbols OB, YB, SB, TB designate two distinct persons (OB ≠ YB and SB ≠ TB), but each symbol must be one of Al (A), Ben (B) or Carl (C).

Translate each statement.

1. “The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.”
   ⇒ OB is the shorter of A and B.  
   Hence OB ∈ {A, B}.

2. “The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.”
   ⇒ SB is the younger of B and C.  
   Thus SB ∈ {B, C} and the younger of B & C must be a boxer.

3. “The taller of Al and Carl is the younger boxer.”
   ⇒ YB is the taller of A and C.  
   Hence YB ∈ {A, C}.

Because OB and YB are different people, exactly one of the following three assignments of (OB, YB) is possible:

Case 1 OB = A, YB = C          (boxers A & C)  
Case 2 OB = B, YB = A          (boxers A & B)  
Case 3 OB = B, YB = C          (boxers B & C)

Examine each case in turn, keeping in mind that SB must be the younger of B and C.

––––––––––––––––––––––  
Case 1 (Boxers A & C, non-boxer B)

• OB = A is the shorter of A and B ⇒ A shorter than B.  
• YB = C is the taller of A and C  ⇒ C taller than A.  
So heights: C > A > B.

The younger of B and C is C, hence SB = C ⇒ C must be shorter than the other boxer (A).  
But C is already taller than A — a contradiction.  
Case 1 impossible.

––––––––––––––––––––––  
Case 2 (Boxers A & B, non-boxer C)

• OB = B is the shorter of A and B ⇒ B shorter than A.  
• YB = A is the taller of A and C  ⇒ A taller than C.  
So far heights: A > C ? > B, with B < A.

The younger of B and C must be a boxer; C is not a boxer, so B must be younger than C.
Statement 2 then gives SB = B, which also requires B be shorter than C.
Combining these: A > C > B in height and C > B > A in age.

All three original statements are now satisfied:
1. shorter(A,B)=B = OB (older boxer) ✔  
2. younger(B,C)=B = SB (shorter boxer) ✔  
3. taller(A,C)=A = YB (younger boxer) ✔  

Thus Case 2 is consistent.

––––––––––––––––––––––  
Case 3 (Boxers B & C, non-boxer A)

• OB = B is the shorter of A and B ⇒ B shorter than A.  
• YB = C is the taller of A and C  ⇒ C taller than A.  
So heights: C > A > B.

YB = C means C is younger than B, so the younger of B and C is C.  
Statement 2 demands this younger brother (C) be the shorter boxer, i.e. C shorter than B, contradicting C taller than A > B.  
Case 3 impossible.

That return-and-turn-round day is the only day on which the ship is moored, and the

228,"Question: Henry and Gretchen are going to play a game.  Henry explains, ""You and I will take turns saying numbers.  The first person will say a number between 1 and 10.  Then the other person will say a number that is at least 1 higher than that number, and at most 10 higher.  We will keep going back and forth in this way until one of us says the number 50.  That person wins.  I'll start.""
""Not so fast!"" says Gretchen.  ""I want to win, so I will start.""
What number should Gretchen say to start?
 Hint: By following this strategy, she is assured a victory.  Think of all of the numbers she will want to say.","By following this strategy, she is assured a victory.  Think of all of the numbers she will want to say.","She wants to say, ""6.""
The series of numbers she will say is 6, 17, 28, 39, 50.
Since she wants to say 50, she needs Henry to say a number between 40 and 49.  Therefore, she wants to say 39.
Knowing she wants to say 39, she needs Henry to say a number between 29 and 38.  So she wants to say 28.  Following this same logic recursively, she will want to say 17, and she will want to say 6 to start the game, and be assured victory.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Step 1 –  Rephrase the rules in “total-so-far” language  
Instead of “saying a number”, think of the players as keeping a running total that starts at 0.  
• On a turn a player adds any integer from 1 through 10 to the current total.  
• Whoever makes the total exactly 50 wins.

Step 2 –  Backwards analysis: look for the “cold” (losing) totals  
Call a position (current total) losing if, when it is your turn at that total, perfect play forces you to lose.  
Work backwards from the winning total 50.

• If the total is 49-40 you can add 1-10 to hit 50, so 40-49 are winning positions.  
• Therefore the total 39 is losing: whatever you add (1-10) hands your opponent a total in 40-49, from which the opponent wins next turn.  

Now continue backwards.  From 39 you can move to 29-38, all of which are winning (they can jump to 39).  
Hence 28 is losing.  

One more step: from 28 you can move to 18-27, all winning, so 17 is losing.  

Again: from 17 you can move to 7-16, all winning, so 6 is losing.  

We now have the whole chain of losing positions:  
6, 17, 28, 39 (and of course 50 where the game ends).  
Notice they are exactly the numbers that are congruent to 6 mod 11.

Step 3 –  The winning strategy that uses those numbers  
If you can hand your opponent one of the losing totals 6, 17, 28 or 39, you are guaranteed to win: after any reply (they must add 1-10), you can always add just enough to reach the next number in the list, eventually finishing with 50.  Concretely, you keep the pair of moves (yours plus your opponent’s) adding up to 11.

Step 4 –  Gretchen’s first move  
Gretchen is making the very first move, so the running total is 0.  
To force Henry into a losing position immediately, she herself must announce the first losing total: 6.

After that her replies are easy.  Whatever Henry adds (1-10), Gretchen adds the complementary number that makes the two moves sum to 11, thereby moving the total successively to 17, 28, 39, and finally 50.

Therefore Gretchen is assured of victory if she starts by saying

(a) Jack's sister argued exactly once with Carol's legal husband after the murder.
(b) Mike's sister argued twice with the victim's legal spouse after the murder. Who was the victim?
 Hint: nan",,"Mike is the victim.
If Mike's sister and Jack's sister are the same person, then (a) reads ""Lily argued exactly once with (Mike or Jack)"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with (the same Mike or Jack)"".  These two statements contradict each other.  Therefore Mike's sister must be different from Jack's sister.
If this is the case then there are two possibilities:
1)  Jack and Carol are brother and sister.  Mike and Lily are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Lily and Mike is married to Carol.  If this is the case, then (a) reads ""Carol argued once with Mike"" and (b) reads ""Lily argued twice with herself"", leaving Jack dead.  Since Lily did not likely argue with herself, this is not the solution.
2)  Jack and Lily are brother and sister.  Mike and Carol are brother and sister.  Jack is married to Carol and Lily is married to Mike.

Since there are no contradictions, this is the solution.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let  

J = Jack (male)  
M = Mike (male)  
C = Carol (female)  
L = Lily (female)

All husbands and wives are chosen from this set (the usual assumption in such puzzle-stories) and no one is married to a blood relative (no incest).

1.  “Jack’s sister argued exactly once with Carol’s legal husband.”
    • Jack’s sister is a woman – either C or L.  
    • Carol’s husband is a man – either J or M.  
    • So there is one (and only one) quarrel between Jack’s sister and Carol’s husband.

2.  “Mike’s sister argued twice with the victim’s legal spouse.”
    • Mike’s sister is also a woman – either C or L.  
    • The victim’s spouse is alive, so that person is one of the other three.  
    • There are exactly two quarrels between Mike’s sister and that spouse.

Because the two quarrel counts (one quarrel vs. two quarrels) are different, the two ordered pairs
   (Jack’s sister , Carol’s husband)   and   (Mike’s sister , victim’s spouse)
cannot be the same pair of people; otherwise they would have quarreled both once and twice, an impossibility.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Decide the marriages (two possibilities).

(A)  J–C and M–L  (Carol married to Jack, Lily married to Mike).  
(B)  J–L and M–C  (Lily married to Jack, Carol married to Mike).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  Work through each marriage pattern.

Marriage pattern (A):  J–C, M–L
-------------------------------------------------
• Carol’s husband is J.  
• Therefore Jack’s sister must be L (otherwise Jack would have quarreled with himself).  
  ⇒  L argued once with J.                                     (1)

For Mike, his sister can only be the remaining woman, C.  
• So Mike’s sister is C.  
• If the victim were J, C would have to quarrel twice with J’s spouse C – i.e. quarrel with herself. Impossible.  
  ⇒  The victim is not J.  
• Let the victim be M.  His spouse is L.  
  ⇒  C quarreled twice with L.                                  (2)

Everything is consistent, with no incest.  In this pattern the victim is M.

Marriage pattern (B):  J–L, M–C
-------------------------------------------------
• Carol’s husband is now M.  
• Hence Jack’s sister must be C (so that she can quarrel with M, not with herself).  
  ⇒  C argued once with M.                                     (1′)

The only woman left for “Mike’s sister” is L.  
• Mike’s sister is L.  
• If the victim were J, L would have to quarrel twice with J’s spouse L – a quarrel with herself. Impossible.  
  ⇒  The victim is not J.  
• Let the victim be M.  His spouse is C.  
  ⇒  L quarreled twice with C.                                  (2′)

Again everything is consistent and there is no incest.  The victim is M.

Step 3.  Conclusion.

Both logically possible, non-incestuous arrangements lead to the same result:  
Mike must be the murder victim.

2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.

5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?
 Hint: nan",,"Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips.

The room is made entirely of concrete blocks and the floor is covered with a thick carpet. The only thing in the room is the diamond that is housed under a glass cube. The glass cube stands on a one-meter pedestal in the centre of the room. Alarm wires spaced eight centimetres apart and running parallel to each other lie under the carpet. The alarm will trigger if more than four kilograms of pressure is applied to any individual wire. Will Carlo who weighs 74 kilograms was able to steal the famous diamond using the following equipment: a five meter 2 x 4 board, four leather straps (each two meters long and five cm wide), a hammer, and a saw. How could he do it without triggering the alarm?
 Hint: nan",,"Will Carlo stole the diamond in the following manner: First, he cut five meter 2 x 4 boards in half. Then using the available straps, he fastened the two boards to his feet like skies. With the boards strapped to his feet, his weight was displacing enough so that he did not exceed the wire's weight tolerance and triggers the alarm. Carlo then slowly and carefully walked to the centre of the room, smashed the glass cube with the hammer, took the diamond and returned the same way he came in.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"The alarm does not react to the total weight that is on the floor, it reacts to the pressure that any one of the parallel wires receives.  
A wire is 8 cm (0.08 m) away from its neighbours and it trips when it is loaded with more than 4 kg.

1.  How many wires can a 5-metre board cover?  
    5 m / 0.08 m ≈ 62.5 → 62 wires.

2.  If Will (74 kg) stands on such a board and the board lies ​across​ the wires (i.e. at right angles to them), his weight is divided among roughly 62 wires.  
    Load per wire ≈ 74 kg / 62 ≈ 1.2 kg < 4 kg.  
    Hence the alarm will not trigger while he is on the board; the same is true even if he is standing near one end – the board is stiff enough that the weight still spreads over a few dozen wires, keeping every individual load safely below 4 kg.

3.  The room is 15 m × 15 m; the diamond is in the centre, 7.5 m from any wall.  
    One 5-m board is therefore not long enough to reach the pedestal in a single span, but it is plenty long enough to let him “walk” it forward.

How Will does it

•   He lays the 5-m 2×4 flat on the carpet perpendicular to the alarm wires, steps onto the end that is nearest the door, and stands there.  
•   While his weight is safely supported, he lifts the rear end of the board, swings it forward and sets it down farther into the room.  
•   He walks to the new front end and repeats the operation.  
    Each “stride” moves the board almost its whole length, so after two complete moves he has advanced just under 10 m; a third move puts him beside the pedestal in the centre (≈7.5 m from the wall).

The leather straps are useful only for balance – he can loop one round his waist and the board when he has to bend down and pick the back end up – but they are not strictly necessary. The hammer (or the hammer head wrapped in carpet) is used to break the glass cover; the saw is never needed.

With the diamond in a pocket he makes the three board-moves in reverse and reaches the door, having never loaded any single wire with more than about 1¼ kg.

Final answer: He places the 5-metre board cross-wise on the floor, stands on it, and “walks” it forward in three instalments, each time lifting the back end and setting it down in front. Because the board always rests simultaneously on more than sixty wires, no wire ever bears more than ≈1.2 kg, far below the 4 kg trip limit, so the alarm never goes off while he enters, removes the diamond, and leaves.",True
232,"Question: One day, in baking class, 15 students were baking cakes when the fire alarm went off. Everyone exited the building, but when they got back, they found someone had dumped all the sugar into two of the batter-filled bowls.

To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.

Charlotte  C = (1–X , Y , Z)

Number of characteristics each woman possesses:

fA = X + Y + (1 – Z)  
fB = X + (1 – Y) + (1 – Z) = X – Y – Z + 2  
fC = (1 – X) + Y + Z = 1 – X + Y + Z.

Now apply Mr. Froopaloop’s choice rule.

• Rule 4a applies iff some woman has exactly two characteristics, and in that case he marries the woman with the fewest characteristics.  
• Rule 4b applies iff some woman has exactly one characteristic, and in that case he marries the woman with the most characteristics.

Both rules must not be triggered simultaneously (otherwise the instruction would be contradictory), so a valid assignment must contain 2’s but no 1’s, or 1’s but no 2’s.

234,"Question: Draw a diagram of the Fantasylands to help you with this teaser...
Beethoven's Wig has been stolen again!  Instead of hiding it in a box, the enemy, who remains anonymous, has hidden it inside one of four castles.  Each castle is located in a different fantasyland and has a creature guarding its gates.  Use the clues below to put the lands in order (1st,2nd,3rd, and 4th), figure out which castle belongs in which land, which creature belong to which castle, and help Beethoven reclaim his wig!
Object: Beethoven's Wig
Fantasylands: Lothlorien, Mordor, Narnia, and Malacandra.
Creatures: Dragon, Troll, Giant, and Balrog.
Castles: Stone, Gold, Glass, and Silver.
1.  Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien, which is to the right of the Balrog.
2.  The Stone Castle is to the right of the Wig, and is placed at either Malacandra or Lothlorien.
3.  The Giant is not at Lothlorien and is not in the same place as the wig.
4.  The Balrog is not in Lothlorien, but he stays at the Stone Castle.
5.  The Troll doesn't live at the Golden Castle, which is to the left of where the Balrog stays and to the right of the Silver Castle.
6.  Mordor is to the left of the Dragon, who stays at the second place.
7.  The Troll is not at the Silver Castle, which is 1 fantasyland to the left of the wig.
 Hint: nan",,"Mordor is the first fantasyland.  It contains the Giant and the Silver Castle.
Narnia is the second land.  It has the Dragon, the Golden Castle, and the Wig.
Malacandra is the third land.  It has the Stone Castle and the Balrog.
Lothlorien is the fourth land.  It contains the Troll and the Glass Castle.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the four positions be 1 (left-most) … 4 (right-most).  
Each position has exactly one land, one castle, one creature; somewhere the Wig is hidden.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  From clue 6: the Dragon is at the 2nd place → creature(2)=Dragon.  
    Mordor is to the left of the Dragon → land(1)=Mordor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Clue 4 says the Balrog stays at the Stone Castle, and he is
    not in Lothlorien.  
    Clue 2 adds that the Stone Castle is either in Malacandra or
    Lothlorien and is to the right of the Wig.  
    Therefore Stone Castle ≠ Lothlorien → Stone Castle = Malacandra.
    So

            castle = Stone   land = Malacandra   creature = Balrog

    occupy the same (so-far unknown) position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Clue 5: Silver Castle < Golden Castle < Balrog-(Stone).  
    Thus the Balrog cannot be in position 1 (nothing is left of 1)
    and cannot be in position 2 (only one site is left of 2 and we
    need two).  Two possibilities remain:

        a) Balrog at position 3  (Silver 1, Gold 2, Balrog 3)  
        b) Balrog at position 4  (several sub-orders possible).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Test case (b) Balrog at 4.
    Clue 1 says Lothlorien is to the right of the Balrog.
    With the Balrog already at the extreme right this is impossible.
    ⇒  (b) is rejected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Therefore Balrog is at position 3.  The castles to its left must
    be Silver (1) and Gold (2):

        pos 1 : Silver Castle  
        pos 2 : Golden Castle  
        pos 3 : Stone Castle (Balrog)  
        pos 4 : ‑-- (only Glass remains later)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Silver Castle is “1 fantasyland to the left of the Wig” (clue 7),
    hence Wig is at position 2.  
    The Stone Castle (pos 3) is to the right of the Wig (clue 2); OK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Lands with the Balrog known (Malacandra at 3) use clue 1 again:
       • Lothlorien is to the right of the Balrog → land(4)=Lothlorien.  
       • Narnia is to the left of Lothlorien → Narnia must be position 2
         (position 1 is already Mordor).  

    The only land still unused is Malacandra, already fixed at position 3.
    So the lands are:

        1  Mordor  2  Narnia  3  Malacandra  4  Lothlorien

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Creatures still undecided: Giant, Troll (Dragon & Balrog fixed).

    • Giant is “not at Lothlorien and not with the Wig” (clue 3).  
      Lothlorien is pos 4 and the Wig is pos 2, leaving positions 1 or 3.
      Position 3 already has Balrog, so Giant must be position 1.

    • Troll is “not at the Golden Castle” (2) and “not at the Silver
      Castle” (1) (clue 5 and 7).  Only position 4 remains → Troll at 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  The only castle still unassigned is Glass, so castle(4)=Glass.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything now fits every clue, giving one consistent arrangement:

Position 1 (left-most)  
 Land: Mordor Castle: Silver Creature: Giant

Position 2  
 Land: Narnia Castle: Golden Creature: Dragon (Gigantic Wig hidden here)

Position 3  
 Land: Malacandra Castle: Stone Creature: Balrog

Position 4 (right-most)  
 Land: Lothlorien Castle: Glass Creature: Troll

 Je = Jean’s grade  
 L  = Lucy’s grade  
 P  = Paul’s grade.

Possible grades are A, B, C, D and (by Jack’s first remark) all four must be different.

Translate every remark into a logical condition.

1.  All four grades are different.                 (1)

2.  Jack: If J = A then L = D.                  (2)

3.  Jean: If L = C then J = D.                  (3)

5.  Paul:  If L = A then P = B.                  (7)
           If Je ≠ B then P ≠ B.                 (8)

We need one assignment of the four different letters A–D that makes every
implication true.

Step 1.  Jack cannot have A.

If J = A, (2) forces L = D.  
With L = D, (3) has false antecedent, so is fine.  
But (5) now has true antecedent (because Je ≠ A for any still-available grade), forcing J = C, contradicting J = A.  
Hence J ≠ A.

Step 2.  Try J = C.

Then (4) requires P = D (C is better only than D).  
The still-unused grades A and B go to Je and L.

Condition (6) forbids L = B (because P = D), so L = A and Je = B.

But (7) with L = A would force P = B, contradicting P = D.  
So J = C is impossible.

Step 3.  Try J = B.

Since J = B, (5) can be satisfied only if its antecedent is false; hence Je must be A (Je ≠ A would force J = C).  
Condition (4) says J is better than P, so P must be C or D.

Clause (3) tells us L cannot be C (otherwise J would have to be D), so L = D and P = C.

Check the remaining implications:

(2)  J ≠ A ⇒ antecedent false – OK.  
(3)  L = D ⇒ antecedent false – OK.  
(6)  L ≠ B ⇒ antecedent false – OK.  
(7)  L ≠ A ⇒ antecedent false – OK.  
(8)  Je ≠ B is true, and P ≠ B (P = C), so (8) is satisfied.

All statements are now true and all four grades are different.  
No other value for J works, so this is the unique solution.

We label the nine places from left to right 1–9 and note the given sizes.

Size  : L   S   L   M   S   L   M   L   S  

Symbols  
P = poison, W = water, V = wine, H = hinder (heats you), C = helper (cools you).

1.  “Poison is all you will get from the bottle on the far right”  →  9 = P.  
    “Each of the end bottles have the same contents”  → 1 = P.

2.  “No medium bottles are poison”  → 4,7 ≠ P.  
3.  “Wine is bad in large doses, so none are large”  → 1,3,6,8 (all large) ≠ V.  
4.  “The hinder bottle is large”  → H is at 3, 6 or 8 (the only large bottles not yet fixed).  
5.  “The hinderer … resides between wine and water”  
        • If H were at 8 its neighbours would be 7 (M) and 9 (P) – impossible.  
        • If H were at 6 its neighbours would be 5 (S) and 7 (M) – both could be wine & water, so possible.  
        • If H were at 3 its neighbours would be 2 (S) and 4 (M) – also possible.  
   Keep both 3 and 6 for the moment.

6.  “No matter how help hides, it will be on poison's left side, but its left side is safe.”  
    So we must have   safe – C – P   in consecutive places.  
7.  “Water is next to the helper.”  
    Safe bottle beside C is therefore water, giving  Water – C – Poison.  
8.  “Neither big nor medium will save your life.”  →  C must be Small.  
    Small positions are 2,5,9; but 9 is poison and 2’s right-hand neighbour (3) is not poison in every case,   
    so C must be at 5, with Water at 4 and Poison at 6:  4=W, 5=C, 6=P.

   Now H cannot be at 6 (it is poison), so H = 3.  
   Since H is between wine and water, places 2 and 4 must be Wine and Water in some order; 4 is already Water, so 2 = Wine.

9.  Count totals so far  
        P : 1,6,9 (three)        OK  
        W : 4 (one)  
        V : 2 (one)  
        H : 3  
        C : 5  
   Still missing: one Water and one Wine.  The remaining undecided places are 7 (Medium) and 8 (Large).  
   Medium cannot be poison and wine cannot be large, so

• the four symbols +, –, *, / each stand for one of the four elementary operations, all different from each other.

We must satisfy the four given “equations”

(1) a + c = a  
(2) b – c = c  
(3) c / b = c  
(4) a * a = b

Step 1 – decide whether c can be 0.  
If c = 0, equation (2) becomes b – 0 = 0.  
This is only automatically true when the symbol “–” is multiplication (because b×0=0 for every b).  
So we set
  –  ≡  ×.

Step 2 – work out what “/” must be.  
With c = 0, equation (3) reads 0 / b = 0.  
The only operation that makes 0 (whatever) equal 0 while leaving b free (b is 1 or 2) is ordinary division (0 ÷ b = 0).  
So
  /  ≡  ÷.

Step 3 – decide what “+” can be.  
Equation (1) is a + 0 = a.  
Both addition and subtraction satisfy x ⊕ 0 = x, while multiplication and division do not.  
So “+” is either addition or subtraction.

Step 4 – use equation (4) to fix the remaining two symbols.  
Since each arithmetical operation must be used once, whichever of {+, –, *, /} has not yet been assigned addition must take it, and whichever has not yet been assigned subtraction must take that.

Case A “+” = addition ⇒ “*” = subtraction  
 Then equation (4) would read a – a = b, i.e. 0 = b, impossible because b is 1 or 2.  
 So this case fails.

Case B “+” = subtraction ⇒ “*” = addition  
 Equation (1):  a – 0 = a (ok)  
 Equation (4):  a + a = b   → b = 2a

Since the three numbers 0, 1, 2 must all appear once, and we already have c = 0, the only way to get b = 2a with b different from 0 is to take a = 1 and b = 2.

All four equations check out:

a + c  :  1 – 0 = 1  
b – c  :  2 × 0 = 0  
c / b  :  0 ÷ 2 = 0  
a * a  :  1 + 1 = 2

Therefore the unique consistent assignment is

a = 1  b = 2  c = 0  
+ means subtraction  
– means multiplication  
* means addition  
/ means division

Final answer:  a = 1, b = 2, c = 0;  “+” = subtraction, “–” = multiplication, “*” = addition, “/” = division",True
239,"Question: You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!
 Hint: nan",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:
71-19-17-68",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the four two-digit sets be  
A = a₁a₂ , B = b₁b₂ , C = c₁c₂ , D = d₁d₂  

Clue-by-clue deductions:

1.  C is A reversed ⇒ C = a₂a₁.

2.  Allowed digits are only 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.

3.  4 × C = D, and D must still be two digits with allowed digits  
 ⇒ C ≤ 24 (so that 4 × C ≤ 96) and tens digit of C cannot be 0 or 2.  
 With the allowed digits, C can only be 10, 16, 17, 18, 19.  
 Check each:  
  10 → 40 (contains 4) ✗  
  16 → 64 (contains 4) ✗  
  17 → 68 (digits allowed) ✓  
  18 → 72 (contains 2) ✗  
  19 → 76 (digits allowed) ✓  
 So (C, D) is either (17, 68) or (19, 76).  
 Accordingly, A is 71 or 91.

4.  a₁ + b₁ = 8.  
 If A = 71 (a₁ = 7) ⇒ b₁ = 1 (possible).  
 If A = 91 (a₁ = 9) ⇒ b₁ = –1 (impossible).  
 Hence A = 71, C = 17, D = 68.

5.  B ≤ 20 and uses allowed digits ⇒ B ∈ {10, 16, 17, 18, 19}.

6.  b₂ × d₂ = A + 1 = 72, with d₂ = 8 (from D = 68).  
 8 × b₂ = 72 ⇒ b₂ = 9.  
 Thus B = 19.

All clues are now satisfied:

A = 71  
B = 19  
C = 17 (71 reversed)  
D = 68 (4 × 17)

Therefore the safe combination is

241,"Question: In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?
 Hint: nan",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.
Therefore, the New York Yankees won the World Series, four games to three.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Reasoning

1.  Home-field schedule  
   • Los Angeles was the home team in Games 1, 2, 6 and 7.  
   • New York was the home team in Games 3, 4 and 5.

2.  A fact about extra-inning games  
   When the home team wins in extra innings it scores the winning run in the bottom half of an inning and the game stops immediately.  
   Therefore the home team can never win an extra-inning game by more than four runs (a grand-slam home run makes the largest possible walk-off margin, 4).

3.  Look at the three extra-inning games

   • Game 2 (at Los Angeles): 6–5 — margin 1 (could be either team).  
   • Game 5 (at New York): 9–6 — margin 3 (could be either team).  
   • Game 7 (at Los Angeles): 13–8 — margin 5.

   The margin in Game 7 is 5, which is larger than 4, so the home team could not
   have won that game.  
   Hence the visiting team won Game 7.

   In Game 7 the visiting team was the New York Yankees (Los Angeles was at home), so the Yankees won Game 7.

4.  Consequence for the Series  
   Because the World Series reached a seventh game, each club had exactly three wins after six games.  
   Winning Game 7 gave the Yankees their fourth victory and therefore the championship.

Final answer: The New York Yankees won the World Series.",True
242,"Question: A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.
 Hint: nan",,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let

1.  Condition (a):  “A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.”

•  If that “one of the groups’’ were the smaller group, we would have ¼s > b, which is impossible because s < b.

4.  Condition (c):  “One of the groups contains only married couples.”

Such a group must have equal numbers of men and women, hence an even size (actually 2 × number-of-couples). (6)

5.  Condition (e):  “One of the groups contains 8 times as many people younger than 50 as those at least 50.”

Check the divisibilities:
 14 = 2 × 7          (multiple of 7)  
 72 = 8 × 9 = 18 × 4     (multiple of 4 and of 9)

No other s (1–17) shares all three required divisibilities with its companion b.

243,"Question: This teaser is a mixture of logic and math. In a number pyramid, the numbers 0-9 are each used once and formed into a pyramid, with one digits at the top, and right below it two digits, below those three digits, and below those four, all arranged in pyramid form. I can not show you a pyramid due to formatting issues.
In this puzzle, you will follow the clues given, and using these clues, create a number pyramid. There is only one answer.
Clues:
1. The number at the apex, or top, of the pyramid minus the leftmost number in the fourth row equals 7.
2. The middle, or second, number in the third row minus the rightmost number in the third row equals 4.
3. The four numbers in row 4 sum to 8.
4. In the second row, the rightmost number minus the leftmost number equals 1.

6. The numbers 1 and 2 are not adjacent to each other.
 Hint: The apex of this pyramid is 9.",The apex of this pyramid is 9.,"Here is the way the number pyramid is filled out:
Row 1: 9
Row 2: 6, 7
Row 3: 3, 8, 4
Row 4: 2, 0, 1, 5",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let us label the positions in the pyramid

row 1 : (1,1)  
row 2 : (2,1) (2,2)  
row 3 : (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)  
row 4 : (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)

All ten digits 0-9 must occupy these ten positions once each.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 1 –  use the hint and clue 1
-------------------------------------------------
The apex is 9 and

9 – (4,1) = 7  ⇒ (4,1) = 2.

So the leftmost bottom number is 2.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 2 –  use clue 3 (row-4 sum is 8)
-------------------------------------------------
(4,1)+(4,2)+(4,3)+(4,4)=8  
2 + (4,2)+(4,3)+(4,4)=8 ⇒ (4,2)+(4,3)+(4,4)=6.

The only way to get 6 with three different unused digits is {0,1,5}.  
Because 1 may not be adjacent to 2 (clue 6), 1 cannot be at (4,2).  
Hence

row 4 = 2 0 1 5
        ^

-------------------------------------------------
Step 3 –  use clue 5 (sum of rightmost numbers)
-------------------------------------------------
Rightmost numbers are (1,1)=9 , (2,2) , (3,3) , (4,4)=5.

9 + (2,2) + (3,3) + 5 = 25  
⇒ (2,2) + (3,3) = 11.          (★)

-------------------------------------------------
Step 4 –  use clue 2 (row-3 middle minus rightmost)
-------------------------------------------------
(3,2) – (3,3) = 4

-------------------------------------------------
Step 5 –  solve (★) and (★★)
-------------------------------------------------
The digits still unused are {3,4,6,7,8}.  
(3,3) must be small enough that (3,3)+4 is still a digit ≤9 and unused.

Try (3,3)=3 → (3,2)=7 ; then (2,2)=11−3=8  (all digits ≤9, distinct) ✔  
Try (3,3)=4 → (3,2)=8 ; then (2,2)=7        (also works so far) ✔  
We will check which of these survives clue 4.

Case A  (3,3)=3 , (3,2)=7 , (2,2)=8  
Case B  (3,3)=4 , (3,2)=8 , (2,2)=7  

-------------------------------------------------
Step 6 –  use clue 4 (row-2 right minus left =1)
-------------------------------------------------
(2,2) − (2,1) = 1 ⇒ (2,1) = (2,2) − 1.

•  Case A: (2,1)=8−1=7  but 7 already at (3,2) – duplicate, so Case A fails.  
•  Case B: (2,1)=7−1=6  – distinct, so Case B survives.

Thus  
(2,1,2) = 6 7 , (3,1,2,3) = 3 8 4.

-------------------------------------------------
Step 7 –  fill the last unused digit
-------------------------------------------------
Digits used so far: 9,6,7,3,8,4,2,0,1,5 – all ten digits are present; the only position not yet filled was (3,1) and we have already assigned it 3. All conditions are satisfied:

Row sums, differences and adjacency of 1 and 2 (positions (4,3) and (4,1)) are all correct.

What was the question?
 Hint: nan",,Do you mind?,GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"When you look for a question whose literal answer “Yes” actually withholds permission – i.e. a “yes” that functions as a “no” – you have to look for a question that is itself phrased in the negative.  
A classic everyday example is any question of the form

“Do you mind if I … ?”

• If I really do object, I say “Yes” (Yes, I do mind) – and what I am really telling you is “No, please don’t do it.”  
• If I have no objection, I say “No” (No, I don’t mind) – which actually means “Yes, go ahead.”

Thus the words “yes” and “no” appear reversed in meaning because of the built-in negative “mind”.

These relations form a directed graph; the required queue is any topological ordering of this graph.  
Proceeding step-by-step:

• The only person with no predecessors is Doc ⇒ Doc must be first.  
• Remove Doc and its arrows.  Now Happy has no predecessors ⇒ Happy is second.  
• Remove Happy.  Smelly now has none ⇒ third.  
• Remove Smelly.  Sneezy now has none ⇒ fourth.  
• Remove Sneezy.  Stumpy now has none ⇒ fifth.  
• Remove Stumpy.  Sleepy now has none ⇒ sixth.  
• Remove Sleepy.  Grumpy now has none ⇒ seventh.  
• Remove Grumpy.  Dopey now has none ⇒ eighth.  
• Remove Dopey.  Droopy now has none ⇒ ninth.  
• The last remaining person is Bashful ⇒ tenth.

Thus the unique order satisfying every clue is

Doc → Happy → Smelly → Sneezy → Stumpy → Sleepy → Grumpy → Dopey → Droopy → Bashful

247,"Question: You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?
 Hint: You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GPT-o3,hint_prompt,"Let the nine pressed digits, in order, be  
d₁ d₂ d₃ d₄ d₅ d₆ d₇ d₈ d₉.

1.  “Each digit once” ⇒ {d₁,…,d₉} = {1,…,9}.  
2.  “No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively”  
    ⇒ |d_k – d_{k+1}| ≠ 1 for k = 1,…,8.  
3.  “2 and 4 are 2nd and 4th” ⇒ {d₂ , d₄} = {2,4}.  
    “6 and 8 are 6th and 8th” ⇒ {d₆ , d₈} = {6,8}.  
4.  Sums:  d₁+d₂+d₃+d₄+d₅ = 19 and d₅+d₆+d₇+d₈+d₉ = 27.

–––––  Step 1 : find d₅.

Add the two given sums:

(d₁+…+d₉) + d₅ = 19 + 27 = 46.

But d₁+…+d₉ = 1+2+…+9 = 45, so

45 + d₅ = 46  ⟹  d₅ = 1.

–––––  Step 2 : place 2 and 4.

Since d₅ = 1, digit 2 cannot be adjacent to it (would violate rule 2).  
Therefore d₄ ≠ 2 (because d₄ is adjacent to d₅).  
Hence

d₂ = 2, d₄ = 4.

–––––  Step 3 : complete the first half.

With d₅ = 1 the first–sum condition gives

d₁ + d₂ + d₃ + d₄ = 18  
d₁ + 2 + d₃ + 4 = 18  ⟹  d₁ + d₃ = 12.

The remaining unused digits are {3,5,6,7,8,9}.  
Because d₃ is between 2 and 4 it cannot be 3 or 5 (would be consecutive to 2 or 4).  
Thus d₃ ∈ {7,9}.

Case work:

• If d₃ = 7 then d₁ = 5.  
• If d₃ = 9 then d₁ = 3 (but 3 next to 2 is consecutive ⇒ impossible).

Therefore

d₁ = 5, d₃ = 7.

–––––  Step 4 : handle the last half.

Digits left to place: {3,6,8,9}.  
We already know {d₆ , d₈} = {6,8}.  
Let their sum (6+8) = 14.

Using d₅ = 1, the second sum condition gives

d₆ + d₇ + d₈ + d₉ = 26  
14 + d₇ + d₉ = 26  ⟹  d₇ + d₉ = 12.

From the remaining digits the only pair summing to 12 is {3,9}.  
So {d₇ , d₉} = {3,9}.

–––––  Step 5 : decide the exact order of d₆ and d₈.

Current partial sequence:

5, 2, 7, 4, 1, d₆, d₇, d₈, d₉  
with {d₆ , d₈} = {6,8} and {d₇ , d₉} = {3,9}.

Try d₇ = 3, d₉ = 9.

• If we set d₆ = 8 and d₈ = 6  
  – 1 ↔ 8: difference 7 (OK)  
  – 8 ↔ 3: difference 5 (OK)  
  – 6 ↔ 3: difference 3 (OK)  
  – 6 ↔ 9: difference 3 (OK)  
  – 6 ↔ 9 are not consecutive, but 8 ↔ 9 would be, so d₈ must be 6.

Thus the only non-violating assignment is

d₆ = 8, d₇ = 3, d₈ = 6, d₉ = 9.

(Interchanging 6 and 8 would put 8 next to 9 and violate rule 2.)

–––––  Step 6 : verify.

Sequence obtained:

5  2  7  4  1  8  3  6  9

• First-five sum: 5+2+7+4+1 = 19.  
• Last-five sum: 1+8+3+6+9 = 27.  
• 2 is 2nd, 4 is 4th; 8 is 6th, 6 is 8th.  
• Every adjacent pair differences: 3,5,3,3,7,5,3,3 – none equals 1.

All conditions satisfied, and uniqueness follows from the eliminations above.

Observations

• S₁ and S₈ always have the same truth-value.  
• S₅ is exactly the negation of S₁.  
Therefore

 if S₁ is true  ⇒  (S₁,S₈) contribute 2 trues and S₅ is false;  
 if S₁ is false ⇒  (S₁,S₈) are false and S₅ is true (1 true so far).

Case 1 : S₁ true (so X = F or H)

Already 2 true statements (A and H).  
Need exactly one more true among B,C,D,F,G.

Sub-case X = F  
 D and G are both true ⇒ 2 extra trues.  Total = 4 (>3).  Impossible.

Sub-case X = H  
 Again D and G are both true ⇒ 2 extra trues.  Total = 4.  Impossible.

Hence S₁ cannot be true.

Case 2 : S₁ false (hence X ≠ F, H)

Now S₅ is true; we still need exactly 2 additional true statements.

Note that for every X ≠ F,H we have S₆ true automatically.  
So one more true statement must come from the set {B,C,D,G}, and exactly one of them must be true.

Examine the six admissible possibilities for X:

1. X = A : D and G are both true → 2 trues (too many).  
2. X = B : B and G true → 2 trues (too many).  
3. X = C : only D is true → exactly 1 true (just right).  
4. X = D : D and G true → 2 trues (too many).  
5. X = E : D and G true → 2 trues (too many).  
6. X = G : C, D, G all true → 3 trues (too many).

Only X = C gives the required total of three true statements:
 True statements: D (“B is not first”), E (“A is wrong”), F (“Neither I nor H is first”).

All other choices give either 4 or 5 true statements.

Therefore the unique arrangement consistent with “exactly three correct guesses” is

249,"Question: Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?
1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this
order): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark
chocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.
2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one
from milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.
3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.
4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.
5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.
6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.
7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped
