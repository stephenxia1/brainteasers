0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.","Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Strategy the prisoners agree on during their one-time meeting

1. Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.

2. Decide that  
   • switch A will be the counting switch,  
   • switch B is just a “dummy’’ switch that can be flipped any time a prisoner is forced to move some switch but does not want to change the value of A.

   The warden has told them that both switches are now OFF, so everybody knows the initial state.

Rules each prisoner follows later

COUNTER’S RULES  
• He keeps in his memory a number Count, initially 0.  
• Every time he is taken to the switch room

    – If switch A is ON, he flips A to OFF and sets  
      Count ← Count + 1.  

    – If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B (so that he does satisfy the “must flip exactly one switch’’ rule).

• Whenever Count reaches 22 he immediately tells the warden  
  “All of us have visited the switch room.”

NON-COUNTER’S RULES  
Each non-counter remembers a personal flag called Signalled, initially FALSE.

When he is taken to the switch room he does the following.

    – If Signalled = FALSE and switch A is OFF  
      (that is, he has never succeeded in signalling before and A is currently OFF)  
      * flip switch A from OFF to ON, and  
      * set Signalled ← TRUE.  
      (This is his one and only contribution to the count.)

    – Otherwise  
      flip switch B (again, just to comply with the “must flip one switch’’ rule).

Why the strategy works

1. Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).

2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.

3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.

4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random “indefinitely’’ (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.

5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter’s declaration is certainly true.

6. Premature declaration is impossible:  
   • For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  
   • A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  
   • That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  
   • A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  
   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.

Consequently the counter’s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF→ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON→OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.",True

Step-by-step deduction

4) D = G·4  or  D = E/3  
If D = G·4, G can be 0,1,2 giving (G,D) = (0,0), (1,4), (2,8).  
(G,D) = (0,0) repeats a digit, so exclude.  
Keep two possibilities: (1,4) or (2,8).

If D = E/3, D ≤ 3 while E is a multiple of 3.  This would repeat a digit when (G,D) = (1,4) or (2,8), so we stay with D = G·4 and the two pairs above.

5) E = J – 1  or  E = D/4  
With (G,D) = (1,4) ⇒ D/4 = 1 duplicates G, impossible.  
With (G,D) = (2,8) ⇒ D/4 = 2 duplicates G, impossible.  
Hence E = J – 1 (so J = E + 1) and D = G·4 with (G,D) = (2,8).

Thus far:  G = 2,  D = 8,  J = E + 1.

7) G = F + 1  or  G = I – 3  
With G = 2:  
 • If G = F + 1 ⇒ F = 1.  
 • If G = I – 3 ⇒ I = 5 duplicates neither but we will see it fails later.  
Take G = F + 1 so F = 1 (will soon be forced).

6) F = B·2  or  F = A – 4  
F = 1 cannot equal B·2 (no integer B), so F = A – 4 ⇒ A = 5.

1) A = B/3  or  A = G + 3  
Now A = 5 and G = 2, so A = G + 3 holds (5 = 2 + 3).  
Therefore A ≠ B/3 and B is still unknown.

8) H = A/2  or  H = C·3  
A/2 = 2.5 not integral, so H = C·3 and C ≤ 3.

3) C = J + 2  or  C = F·3  
Since F = 1, F·3 = 3 is possible and keeps C ≤ 3.  
Choose C = 3 (from C = F·3).

Then 8) gives H = 3·3 = 9.

9) I = H + 3  or  I = D/2  
H + 3 = 12 impossible, so I = D/2 = 8/2 = 4.

2) B = I – 4  or  B = E + 4  
With I = 4, I – 4 = 0, so one valid choice is B = 0.

Digits used so far: A5, B0, C3, D8, F1, G2, H9, I4.  
Remaining digits {6,7} must be E and J, and since J = E + 1 we get  
E = 6, J = 7.

10) J = H – 2  or  J = C·2  
H – 2 = 9 – 2 = 7, matching J, so the first alternative is satisfied.

Final answer: 5038612947",True
4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Label the 1000 equally–spaced points  
0,1,2,…,999 around a circle.

Choose an integer step-size s (1 ≤ s ≤ 999) and start at 0.  
Join 0 to s, then s to 2s, then 2s to 3s, … each time reducing modulo 1000.  
A single unbroken “star” is obtained exactly when

1. gcd(1000, s)=1 (so every vertex is met before we get back to 0),  
2. s≠1, 999 (otherwise the figure is just the regular 1000-gon).

Condition 1 means s must be coprime with 1000; the number of such s is Euler’s totient
φ(1000).

 1000 = 2³·5³  
 φ(1000) = 1000(1−½)(1−⅕) = 1000·½·⅘ = 400.

Among these 400 admissible s-values, one pair is {1,999}; remove it, leaving 398.

The step-sizes s and 1000−s trace the same picture, only in opposite directions,
so each star is counted twice.  Hence

number of distinct stars = (398)/2 = 199.

Final answer: 199",True
5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
7,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
8,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.","Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

15,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.
The rest go like this-
1st House: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Cats, Dunhill
2nd House: Blue, Dane, Tea, Horse, Blends
3rd House: Red, Brit, Milk, Birds, Pall Malls
4th House: Green, German, Coffee, FISH, Prince
5th House: White, Swede, Beer, Dogs, Bluemasters",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the five houses stand in a row, numbered 1 (leftmost) to 5 (rightmost).  
For every house we have to determine  

• colour • nationality • drink • cigar • pet  

and each attribute must occur exactly once.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Set down the immediately fixed facts
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 9: House 1 = Norwegian  
Rule 8: House 3 drinks Milk  
Rule 14: Norwegian lives next to the blue house  ⇒  House 2 = Blue

─────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  Locate the Green and White houses
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 4: Green is immediately left of White.

The pair (Green, White) cannot be (1,2) because 2 is already Blue;  
not (2,3) because 2 is Blue;  
not (3,4) because 3 already drinks Milk but rule 5 says Green drinks Coffee.

Therefore (Green, White) = (4,5).  
Rule 5 then gives: House 4 drinks Coffee.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  Find the remaining colours
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Colours used so far: Blue(2), Green(4), White(5).  
The two colours left are Red and Yellow, for houses 1 and 3.

Rule 7: Yellow-house smokes Dunhill.  
Two cases:

A. House 1 = Yellow (⇒ Dunhill in 1)  
B. House 3 = Yellow (⇒ Dunhill in 3)

Case A quickly proves consistent; Case B sooner or later contradicts several rules.  
We continue with Case A.

So far
House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Dunhill  
House 3: Red

Rule 1: Brit lives in the Red house  ⇒  House 3 = Brit.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Use the Dunhill / horse neighbour rule
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 11: Horse owner lives next to Dunhill.  
Dunhill is in house 1, so the neighbour is house 2.  
⇒ House 2 keeps a Horse.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Work with Blends, Water and Cats
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule 15: Blends smoker lives next to Water drinker.  
Rule 10: Blends smoker lives next to Cat keeper.

If Water were anywhere except house 1 we would run into a dead end,  
so place Water in house 1.  
Then Blends must be in its only neighbour, house 2, satisfying rule 15.  
To satisfy rule 10 as well, put Cats in house 1.

Now
House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Water, Dunhill, Cats  
House 2: Blue, –, –, Blends, Horse

─────────────────────────────────────────────
6.  Identify the Dane and his drink
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The Dane drinks Tea (rule 3).  
Tea is still unassigned and the only house that can take it so far is house 2.  
⇒ House 2 = Dane, drinks Tea.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
7.  Place Beer and Bluemasters
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Drinks used: Water(1), Tea(2), Milk(3), Coffee(4).  
The only drink left is Beer, so Beer is in house 5.  
Rule 12: Bluemasters smoker drinks Beer  ⇒  house 5 smokes Bluemasters.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
8.  Locate Prince and the German
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Cigars left: Pall Mall, Prince.  
Rule 13: German smokes Prince.

If Prince were in house 3 (Brit) or house 5 (already Bluemasters) we'd clash,  
so Prince must be in house 4, making house 4 the German.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
9.  Put Pall Mall and Birds
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The last unassigned cigar is Pall Mall, so it belongs to house 3.  
Rule 6: Pall Mall smoker keeps Birds  ⇒  house 3 keeps Birds.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
10.  Finish the pets and nationalities
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Pets assigned so far: Cats(1), Horse(2), Birds(3).  
Left: Dogs and Fish.

Rule 2: Swede keeps Dogs  ⇒  house 5 is the Swede with Dogs.  
The only pet still missing is Fish, therefore house 4 keeps Fish.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
11.  Check that every rule is met
─────────────────────────────────────────────
All fifteen statements are satisfied by the completed table:

House 1: Norwegian Yellow Water Dunhill Cats  
House 2: Dane    Blue  Tea  Blends  Horse  
House 3: Brit    Red   Milk  Pall Mall Birds  
House 4: German  Green  Coffee Prince  Fish  
House 5: Swede   White  Beer  Bluemasters Dogs

16,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Jason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.
Roger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.

After 10 minutes, Johnny walked away with the coins and Mark, after complaining futilely to his mother, left with nothing.
How did Johnny place the coins?",Stars and pentagons,"If you draw a 5-pointed star with all sides of equal length, you will create a pentagon in the middle with all 5 sides of equal length. Then draw another 5 pointed star, upside-down, using the 5 points of the interior pentagon as the points of the inner star,  This will give you another 5-sided pentagon in the interior of the second, smaller star.
Now, take your 16 coins and place 5 on the outside points of the outside star.  Then place 5 more on the points of each of the two pentagons you have created.  Finally, place the last coin in the dead center of this drawing.
The lines are as follows:
5 lines for the actual drawing of the outside star
5 lines for the actual drawing of the inside star
5 lines that start from any outside point of the outside star and go to the opposite point of the inside star, passing through 1 point of the inner pentagon, the dead center coin on the way.
Total lines: 15",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,True
