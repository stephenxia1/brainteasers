{"ID": 0, "Question": "It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,\" his wife called from the dining room.\nThe math major said, \"I'll get them Dad!\"\nAs everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.\nThe table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, \"I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.\"  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, \"Wow, what'd that rock set you back?\"\n\"This calls for a toast!\" roared Dad.\n\"Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!\" Mom gushed.  \"I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?\" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  \"Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,\" she asked and then quickly added, \"But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?\"\n\"Sure Mom,\" her daughter answered.  \"We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.\"\n\"Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,\" one of the girls announced.\n\"What a coincidence,\" said the boy sitting next to her.  \"We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.\"\n\"That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team\" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, \"he gave me the idea!\"\n\"Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,\" the father announced.  \"She'd really like to see you all.\"\n\"Sorry Dad,\" the business major replied, \"we have to leave tomorrow.

One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.\nThe physics major said \"I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.\"\n\"Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer\" the dad said.  \"You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,\" he joked.  \"I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,\" the father remarked to the golfer.  \"Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,\" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  \"How about you join me on the links?\"\n\"Sure!\" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.\n\"Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs\" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.\n\"It's a foursome then!\" her dad said happily.\nIan grumbled, \"Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!\"\nThe boyfriend of the political science major laughed, \"I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.\"\n---------\nIdentify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.

The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.\n3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.

Choose one prisoner to be the COUNTER.  The other 22 prisoners are NON-COUNTERS.\n\n2.

Only non-counters ever turn switch A from OFF to ON, and each of them does that at most once (because after doing it he sets Signalled = TRUE).\n\n2. Only the counter ever turns switch A from ON to OFF, and every time he does so he adds 1 to his Count.\n\n3. Therefore Count is exactly the number of different non-counters that have already managed to turn A ON at least once.\n\n4. Because the warden selects prisoners at random \u201cindefinitely\u2019\u2019 (each prisoner will be chosen arbitrarily many times in the long run), every non-counter will eventually encounter the room while A is OFF and will succeed in turning it ON once.  Hence sooner or later Count will become 22.\n\n5. When Count = 22 every prisoner has definitely visited the switch room at least once, so the counter\u2019s declaration is certainly true.\n\n6. Premature declaration is impossible:  \n   \u2022 For Count to increase, A had to be ON.  \n   \u2022 A can be turned ON only by a non-counter who has never signalled before.  \n   \u2022 That non-counter must therefore have visited the room.  \n   \u2022 A non-counter can do this only once, so no one is counted twice.  \n   Thus Count cannot reach 22 until all 22 non-counters have visited.\n\nConsequently the counter\u2019s eventual announcement is guaranteed to be correct, and the prisoners will be released.\n\nFinal answer:  Designate one prisoner as counter; use switch A for counting and switch B as a harmless dummy.  Non-counters turn A OFF\u2192ON exactly once (their first chance), otherwise flip B; the counter turns A ON\u2192OFF and counts.  When his count reaches 22 he announces success, which is then certain.", "Status": true}

AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199.

{"ID": 5, "Question": "I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)\nI was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, \"I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.\nNow I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:\n1. The king is next to at least one diamond.\n2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.\n3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.\n4. The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin.

In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da).

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.", "Hint": "In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Human Solution": "From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:\n_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.\nBart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.\n_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.\nPatty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.

Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).

The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.\n_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).\nIn summary:\nBart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nJason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.\nRoger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise.

This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.\nThe monster gives them the whole night to think.\nThe Task:\nDevise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.\nAssumptions:\n1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.\n2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.\n3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional \"white\" or \"black\".\n4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, \"white\" can mean \"my mother did my laundry\" and \"black\" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.", "Hint": "1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.\n2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.", "Human Solution": "Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer \"white\" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1.  What can the last person (call him P10) transmit?  \n    \u2013 He is allowed to utter exactly one of two words, \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d.  \n    \u2013 Therefore he can convey at most one single binary bit of information to the other nine people.  \n\n2.  Why can we not guarantee that all 10 survive?  \n    \u2013 The unknown configuration of hats is a 10-bit string (each hat = 0 for black, 1 for white).  \n    \u2013 Everybody except P10 sees at most 9 of those bits.  \n    \u2013 Only one additional bit (the one word said by P10) can be added to what the others already see.  \n    \u2013 A single bit is insufficient to distinguish all 10 possibilities for P10\u2019s own hat colour, so P10 cannot be sure of saving himself.  \n    \u2013 Hence, at best 9 of them can be saved with certainty, and that is the optimum we must aim for.\n\n3.  A one-bit message that lets the other 9 deduce their own colours.  \n    \u2013 The most familiar one-bit property of a set of binary digits is \u201cparity\u201d, i.e. whether the number of 1\u2019s is even or odd.  \n    \u2013 Plan: encode the parity of white hats P10 sees.  \n\n4.  The convention agreed upon during the night  \n    \u2022 \u201cwhite\u201d uttered by P10 means:  \u201cThe number of white hats I (P10) can see is EVEN.\u201d  \n    \u2022 \u201cblack\u201d uttered by P10 means:  \u201cThe number of white hats I can see is ODD.\u201d  \n    (Any other fixed assignment of the two words to the two parities would work equally well; this one is just explicit.)\n\n5.  How the daytime play proceeds  \n\n    P10 (sees 9 hats).  \n       \u2013 Counts the white hats in front of him.  \n       \u2013 Announces \u201cwhite\u201d if that count is even, otherwise \u201cblack\u201d.  \n       \u2013 He survives with probability \u00bd (he does not know his own colour) but has now broadcast the parity bit.\n\n    P9 (sees 8 hats).  \n       \u2013 He has heard the announced parity and he sees the colours of P1\u2013P8.  \n       \u2013 Let W be the number of white hats he sees.  \n       \u2013 If announced parity = \u201ceven\u201d and W is even, then his own hat must be black; if announced parity = \u201ceven\u201d and W is odd, his hat must be white.  \n       \u2013 If announced parity = \u201codd\u201d, reverse the conclusion.  \n       \u2013 He says the deduced colour and is guaranteed to be correct.  \n       \u2013 Before P8 is addressed, everyone still alive recomputes the new \u201crunning parity\u201d by flipping it whenever someone just announced \u201cwhite\u201d.  (Operationally easier: Pk simply remembers what has already been said and what he still sees; the algebra works out.)\n\n    P8, P7, \u2026 , P1 proceed identically:  \n       \u2013 Each of them knows the original parity bit and has heard all answers between P10 and himself, so he can compute the parity of the unseen hats that still remain.  \n       \u2013 Comparing that with what he actually sees, he infers his own colour with certainty.\n\n6.  Verification by an example  \n\n    Suppose the true hat line (from P10 at the back to P1 at the front) is  \n          W  B  B  W  W  B  W  B  B  W  \n          10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  \n\n    \u2022 P10 sees eight whites?  Count = 5 whites (odd) \u2192 says \u201cblack\u201d (odd parity).  \n    \u2022 P9 hears \u201codd\u201d, sees 4 whites (even) \u21d2 must himself be white \u2192 says \u201cwhite\u201d, lives.  \n    \u2022 P8 now knows current parity should be \u201codd XOR white\u2010said\u201d = even, sees 3 whites (odd) \u21d2 he is white \u2192 speaks, lives.  \n      \u2026 and so on; everyone down to P1 determines the colour correctly.\n\n7.  Optimality proof  \n\n    \u2022 Because the first spoken word can carry only one bit of information, any deterministic protocol must leave P10 with at least two equally possible colours consistent with what he sees and the message he is constrained to give.  Therefore his survival probability can never exceed \u00bd.  \n    \u2022 Once P10\u2019s word is fixed, the remaining nine people together see nine hats plus the one-bit message, i.e. the entire information needed to deduce their own colours uniquely.  So the above protocol, which indeed guarantees perfect knowledge for the remaining nine, is optimal.\n\nConclusion  \nThe best achievable strategy guarantees the survival of 9 out of the 10 islanders; the very last person in line survives with probability \u00bd.  The concrete protocol is:\n\nLast person: say \u201cwhite\u201d if you see an even number of white hats, \u201cblack\u201d otherwise.  \nEach subsequent person: knowing the original parity and what has been said so far, compare it with the parity of white hats you still see; speak the only colour that makes parities match.\n\nFinal answer: 9 people are guaranteed to live; the strategy is that the last person encodes the parity (even/odd) of white hats he sees with the word \u201cwhite\u201d/\u201cblack\u201d, and everyone after him uses that bit together with what they observe to deduce and announce their own hat colour with certainty.", "Status": true}

Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.\nBecause of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.\nBecause of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.\n1: M, C\n2: A, L, R\n3: N, H\n4: G, E, Y\n5: O, P, D\nThe F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.\n1: M, C, T\n2: A, L, R\n3: N, H, F\n4: G, E, Y\n5: O, P, D, I\nThe J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW.

There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.\nThe Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.\n1: M, C, T, W, X\n2: A, L, R, V, Q\n3: N, H, F, B, U\n4: G, E, Y, J, K\n5: O, P, D, I, S", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1).

Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate.

From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2.

They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6.

McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

Induction step  \nAssume the rule is true for every island with fewer than N blue-eyed people:  \n\u201cIf there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave together on Night k.\u201d\n\nNow consider an island with N (\u22652) blue-eyed people.  \nPick any blue-eyed islander X.

So Anne made 12 history errors.\nThe twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.\nAnne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole. Martin's isn't McCall (7), so must be Dean. Luke's is McCall.\nThus ( geography-history );\nDavid - Gail - Waters - 16 -8;\nEdward - Anne - O'Connell - 11- 12;\nGeorge - Diane - Vole - 15 - 11;\nLuke - Wendy - McCall - 10 - 6;\nMartin - Louella - Dean - 12 - 10;\nSammy - Susan - Seal - 14 - 7;", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}
{"ID": 41, "Question": "In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)", "Hint": "The number of days depends on the number of red hats.", "Human Solution": "It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nHow this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Let  \nR = the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves,  \nB = 100 \u2013 R = the number of blue-hatted dwarves.  \nWe are told 1 \u2264 R \u2264 99, and every dwarf is perfectly logical.\n\nKey facts every dwarf knows (and knows that the others know, etc.)  \n1. Every night all 100 dwarves see the other 99 hats.  \n2. It is forbidden to talk about hat colours.  \n3. There is **at least one red and at least one blue hat**.  \n4.

Consequently all k + 1 reds stay home the next night and never return.\n\nHence, if there are k + 1 red hats, they disappear after k + 1 nights, completing the induction.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nConclusion  \nIf there are R red-hatted dwarves, they will all stay away starting on the (R + 1)-st feast; equivalently, it takes exactly R days before there are no red hats at the party.\n\nBecause the total population is 100 with at least one blue hat, R can be at most 99, so the number of days required is some integer R between 1 and 99 \u2014 precisely equal to the actual number of red-hatted dwarves.\n\nFinal answer: After exactly as many days as there are red-hatted dwarves (at most 99), no red-hatted dwarf will attend the feast.", "Status": true}

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4.

The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.\nHe decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.

The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.\nEach company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full \u00be pay for \u00be of a bridge ($750,000).\nWhen Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.

Every extra month without the bridge would cost the country far more than the extra construction cost in lost tourist revenue and lost opportunities.

{"ID": 104, "Question": "Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.\nManny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, \"I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.\"\nMoe answers, \"IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.\"\nJack thinks for a bit, and then says, \"Now I know all of our numbers.\"\nMr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.\nWhat numbers does she say they each are holding?", "Hint": "Do casework on what Moe can have.", "Human Solution": "Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.\nFrom Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.\nThere are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:\n(1, 2, 11)\n(1, 6, 7)\n(1, 10, 3)\n(3, 2, 9)\n(3, 6, 5)\n(3, 10, 1)\n(5, 2, 7)\n(5, 6, 3)\n(7, 2, 5)\n(7, 6, 1)\n(9, 2, 3)\n(11, 2, 1)\nSince Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.\nMr. Simkin suggests to Gretchen that she may have a career in law enforcement if she can further hone these impressive deductive reasoning skills.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower.

{"ID": 123, "Question": "In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two \"machine-on\" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these \"machine-on\" back-ups match the two \"on\" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one \"on\" off and one \"off\" on leaving the other \"on\" on and \"off\" off, that is, only two switches are activated. Back inside the room, we can now match the switches by seeing which \"on\" machine is now off and which \"off\" is now on (when we activate its switch).", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "1.  While he is still inside he notices that every saw is running and therefore that every outside back-up switch must be ON.  \n   He now leaves the room; from this moment on he can use only the four back-up switches.\n\n2.  Outside he does the following time-schedule with the four switches (the exact minutes are not important \u2013 only that the periods are clearly different).\n\n   \u2022 Turn every switch OFF and wait until every saw has stopped and all motors start to cool.  \n   \u2022 Turn switch 1 ON, let it run 6 minutes, then turn it OFF again.  \n   \u2022 Turn switch 2 ON, let it run 4 minutes, then turn it OFF again.  \n   \u2022 Turn switch 3 ON, let it run 2 minutes, then turn it OFF again.  \n   \u2022 Turn switch 4 ON and, without waiting, walk straight back into the machine room.\n\n3.  What he finds inside:\n\n   \u2022 One saw is still running \u2013 that saw is powered through switch 4 (the only switch that is still ON).  \n   \u2022 Of the three saws that are standing still, their motors are at three distinctly different temperatures:  \n     \u2013 the hottest one ran 6 minutes ago \u2192 switch 1,  \n     \u2013 the next warm one ran 4 minutes ago \u2192 switch 2,  \n     \u2013 the coolest one stopped 2 minutes ago \u2192 switch 3.\n\n4.  Thus each machine is identified uniquely:\n\n   running \u2192 switch 4  \n   hottest stopped \u2192 switch 1  \n   warm stopped \u2192 switch 2  \n   coolest stopped \u2192 switch 3\n\nBecause the brother himself chose the order and the running times, he now knows exactly which outside back-up switch belongs to which saw.\n\nFinal answer: He uses the fact that a motor that has been running different lengths of time stays hot for different lengths of time. By letting one switch run continuously, another run a long time and cool a little, another run a shorter time and cool more, and the last not run at all, he produces four distinguishable conditions (running, hot, warm, cold). When he re-enters the room he matches those four conditions to the four time-patterns he created, thereby identifying every switch with its correct machine.", "Status": true}
{"ID": 124, "Question": "A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:\na) The whole cube being painted red\nb) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back\nc) The front and back faces being painted black\nd) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue\nAll of the following facts about painting the cube are true:\n1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.\n2. Color mixing goes as follows:\n-Red+Blue=Purple\n-Black+White=Gray\n-Red+White=Pink\n-Blue+White=Light Blue\n-Red+Black=Maroon\n-Blue+Black=Dark Blue\n3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.\n4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.\n5. Exactly one of the following is true:\n-Black was added first.\n-Red was added before blue.\n-Blue was added after white.\n-White was added last.\nIn what order were the colors added?", "Hint": "If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.", "Human Solution": "White, blue, black, red.\nBecause there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.\nBlack has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.\nSince neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.\nGoing back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).

We know that \"Jung\" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If \"Jung\" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so \"Jung\" has to be chapter 1.  This makes \"Kant\" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.

{"ID": 148, "Question": "There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin.

First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other.

So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.\nSince there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.\nSince there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.\nFact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son.

{"ID": 150, "Question": "There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants.

Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.\n2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.\n3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.\nSo now the question:\nWill that one sheep get eaten or not and why?", "Hint": "There are two hints.

Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.\nNow look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.\nSo now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.\nWe can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.\nYou can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Reasoning step by step\n\nStep 0 \u2013  What matters to a lion  \nA lion is prepared to eat the sheep only if, after doing so, he is 100 % certain he will not be eaten himself.  \n\u2022 If he is not perfectly safe, he will forgo mutton and live on grass.  \n\u2022 If he **is** perfectly safe, he prefers the (tastier) sheep.\n\nStep 1 \u2013  Reduce the problem to \u201cIs the new sheep safe?\u201d  \nIf a particular lion (call him L) is thinking of eating the sheep, he must predict what happens **after** he eats and has turned into a sheep.  \nAt that moment there will be one fewer lion on the island.  \nTherefore \u201cWill L eat?\u201d \u21d4 \u201cIf I subtract one lion from the current total, will the new sheep be safe?\u201d\n\nStep 2 \u2013  Work out the safety of a sheep for small numbers of lions\n\n0 lions\u2003(trivial warm-up)\u2003A sheep is obviously safe.\n\n1 lion\u2003\u2022 If that single lion eats the sheep he becomes a sheep.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 There will then be 0 lions, so the new sheep is perfectly safe.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Therefore with 1 lion the sheep **does get** eaten.\n\n2 lions\u2003\u2022 Suppose one of them tried to eat the sheep.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003He would turn into a sheep while the other (now sole) lion remains.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 From the 1-lion case we know a lone lion *will* eat any sheep,  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003so the first lion would then be eaten.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 A lion prefers grass to being eaten, so no lion initiates the attack.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Therefore with 2 lions the sheep is **safe**.\n\n3 lions\u2003\u2022 Imagine one lion contemplates eating the sheep.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Afterwards there would be 2 lions left.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 From the 2-lion result we know that a sheep **is** safe when 2 lions watch it.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Thus the new sheep would be safe; the acting lion likes that outcome,  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003so he goes ahead and eats.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Therefore with 3 lions the sheep **does get** eaten.\n\nWe can already see a pattern:  \n# lions\u2003\u2192 sheep\u2019s fate  \n0 safe, 1 eaten, 2 safe, 3 eaten \u2026\n\nStep 3 \u2013  Inductive argument for all N lions\n\nInductive hypothesis  \nLet Safe(N) mean \u201ca sheep is safe when N lions are present\u201d.  \nWe have established  \nSafe(0) = T,\u2003Safe(1) = F,\u2003Safe(2) = T,\u2003Safe(3) = F.\n\nInductive step  \nAssume we know Safe(k) for every k \u2264 N.  \nConsider N+1 lions.  \n\u2022 A lion who is deciding whether to eat asks \u201cIf I do, there will afterwards be N lions \u2013 is a sheep safe in that world?\u201d  \n\u2022 If Safe(N) = T, he is totally safe and prefers to eat, so the sheep is eaten \u2192 Safe(N+1) = F.  \n\u2022 If Safe(N) = F, eating would doom him, so he refuses \u2192 sheep survives \u2192 Safe(N+1) = T.\n\nHence Safe(N+1) = NOT Safe(N) for every N \u2265 0, so safety simply alternates with N.  \nConsequently\n\nSafe(N) is True\u2003iff\u2003N is even.\n\nStep 4 \u2013  Apply the result to 100 lions\n\n100 is even.  \nTherefore Safe(100) = True: a sheep watched by 100 lions will not be eaten.  \nThe \u201cnearest\u201d lion mentioned in the assumptions will think the situation through, realise that after eating he would face 99 lions (an odd number \u2192 sheep not safe \u2192 he would be eaten), and will therefore decline to attack.

The problem states that that day is Smoe\u2019s 47th birthday.  \n   \u2022 So Smoe was born on 1 May of year (current year \u2212 47).  \n   \u2022 The current (non-leap) year is therefore 1979 (because 1980 is a leap year).  \n   \u2022 Thus Smoe\u2019s birth year = 1979 \u2212 47 = 1932.\n\n6.  The other friend was born \u201ca year later,\u201d i.e. in 1933.\n\nConclusion: Smoe was born in May 1932, Joe in May 1933. Therefore Smoe is the older of the two friends.\n\nFinal answer: Smoe", "Status": true}

{"ID": 193, "Question": "It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

Congratulations!", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "Number the pumpkins 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 around the circle (clock-wise).  \nWhen you \u201cblow\u201d pumpkin k, the three pumpkins k\u22121 , k , k+1 (indices taken mod 7) change\nstate (lit \u21c4 out).\n\nLet xk\u2208{0,1} denote whether you will blow pumpkin k (1=yes, 0=no).\nLet bj\u2208{0,1} be the final state of pumpkin j (1=lit, 0=out).  \nInitially every pumpkin is lit, i.e. the initial vector is (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).\n\nEach blow adds (mod 2) the vector that has 1\u2019s in positions k\u22121 , k , k+1.\nHence for every j we have\n\n   bj = 1 + xj\u22121 + xj + xj+1\u2003(mod 2).

Therefore\n\n   x0 = x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = x5 = x6 = 1.\n\nThus every variable must be 1; i.e. you must blow on every single pumpkin\n(and, because the linear system has full rank, this is the only possible\nsolution).  Because each blow flips an odd number (3) of lanterns, an odd\nnumber (seven) of blows is also necessary to change the overall parity from\n7 lit to 0 lit.\n\nPractical recipe:\nstart anywhere, walk once around the circle, and blow on every pumpkin\nexactly one time (order does not matter).  After the seventh blow all seven\njack-o\u2019-lanterns will be out and the Great Pumpkin will leave you in peace.\n\nFinal answer: Blow on each of the seven lanterns exactly once; after the seventh blow all of them are extinguished.", "Status": true}

Denote the five colours  \n   R = red, B = blue, Y = yellow, G = green, K = black.  \n   Each day Peter wears an unordered pair of different colours.\n\n2.  Rule 3 says one colour is used on exactly four days.  \n   Because the same colour may not appear on consecutive days, the only\n   way to fit four occurrences into the seven-day week is on\n   Monday-Wednesday-Friday-Sunday (positions 1, 3, 5, 7).\n\n3.  Monday\u2019s pair is {B,K} (rule 4).\n   Therefore the \u201cfour-day\u201d colour must be either B or K.\n\n   \u2022  If it were K, we would need three more distinct pairs containing K,\n      but K cannot be paired with R (rule 7) and {B,K} is already used,\n      leaving only {K,Y} and {K,G}.  That gives at most two further pairs,\n      so K cannot be the four-day colour.\n\n   \u2022  Hence B is the colour used on four days: Monday, Wednesday,\n     Friday, Sunday.\n\n4.

B,?   \u2014     B,?\n\n   Tuesday cannot contain B or K,  \n   Wednesday cannot contain the two Tuesday colours or K (to avoid\n   repeating {B,K}),  \n   Thursday must contain G (rule 5) and no Wednesday colour,  \n   Friday contains B (no Y, rule 6) and no Thursday colour,  \n   Saturday contains no Friday colour,  \n   Sunday contains B and no Saturday colour, and must give a\n   new B-pair (rule 1).\n\n5.  Start with Tuesday.  The only possible pair not using B or K is\n   {R,G}, {R,Y} or {Y,G}.  \n\n   \u2022  If Tuesday were {R,Y}, then Wednesday would have to be {B,G},\n     but G could not then appear on Thursday \u2192 impossible.\n\n   \u2022  If Tuesday were {Y,G}, then Wednesday would have to be {B,R},\n     which would repeat on Friday (see below) \u2192 impossible.\n\n   \u2022  Therefore Tuesday must be {R,G}.\n\n   That fixes the rest of the week uniquely:\n\n       Mon  {B,K}\n       Tue  {R,G}\n       Wed  {B,Y}          (Y is the only colour not in Tue and not K)\n       Thu  {G,K}          (needs G, not B or Y, cannot duplicate Tue)\n       Fri  {B,R}          (needs B, not G or K, no Y allowed)\n       Sat  {Y,K}          (cannot use B or R, cannot duplicate Thu)\n       Sun  {B,G}          (new B-pair, no Y or K from Sat)\n\n6.

If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?", "Hint": "This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.\nLucy in the sky with...", "Human Solution": "The high suit is diamonds.\nThe first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.\nIf the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.\nIf the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:\n1. heart, heart, club\nspade, spade, club\ndiamond, diamond, club\n2. heart, heart, diamond\nspade, spade, diamond\nclub, club, diamond\n3. spade, spade, diamond\nclub, club, diamond\nheart, heart, diamond\n4. spade, spade, diamond\nheart, heart, diamond\nclub, club, diamond\n5. diamond, diamond, heart\nclub, club, heart\nspade, spade, heart\n6. diamond, diamond, spade\nclub, club, spade\nheart, heart, spade\nGame 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit. Games 5 and 6 cannot be possible because no one had both hearts and spades. This leaves only games 2, 3, and 4, which all have diamonds as the high suit.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

After you say 39, Henry\u2019s next number is between 40 and 49.  \n   You can then add the remaining amount (between 1 and 10) to hit 50 and win.\n\nThus Gretchen must begin by saying 6.", "Status": true}

Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.

The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x.

The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9.

Positions 6 and 8 are {6,8}.  \n   The unused digits are 3,6,8,9 and their sum is 26, matching the required \u03a3\u2086\u2079 a\u1d62 = 26, so those four digits fill the last four places.\n\n   Try a\u2086 = 6, a\u2088 = 8.  \n   Then the remaining digits (3,9) must occupy positions 7 and 9.  \n   Putting 3 at a\u2087 forces 9 at a\u2089, but 8 and 9 would then be consecutive (forbidden).  \n   Putting 9 at a\u2087 is already ruled out because 8\u20139 would be consecutive.  \n   Hence a\u2086 = 6 fails.\n\n   Therefore a\u2086 = 8 and a\u2088 = 6.  \n   Now the digits left are 3 and 9.\n\n   \u2022 If a\u2087 = 9, then 8\u20139 is consecutive \u21d2 forbidden.  \n   \u2022 So a\u2087 = 3 and a\u2089 = 9.  \n     Check adjacency:  \n     1\u20138 (|7|), 8\u20133 (|5|), 3\u20136 (|3|), 6\u20139 (|3|) \u2014 none are consecutive.\n\n   All conditions are satisfied.\n\nHence the unique permissible sequence is\n\n5 2 7 4 1 8 3 6 9.\n\nFinal answer: 527418369", "Status": true}

He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.

Only an ordinary prisoner is ever allowed to turn A from off to on, and\n    each ordinary prisoner is permitted to do that exactly once.\n    Therefore there are exactly 22 legitimate \u201coff \u2192 on\u201d events on switch A,\n    each caused by a different ordinary prisoner on the first occasion that\n    he finds A off.\n\n2.  Only the leader is ever allowed to turn A from on to off, and he does so\n    precisely once for each of the 22 \u201coff \u2192 on\u201d events.  \n    Consequently the leader\u2019s counter C is increased exactly once for each\n    distinct ordinary prisoner who has visited the room at least once.\n\n3.  When C finally reaches 22, every ordinary prisoner must already have\n    visited the switch room (otherwise the corresponding \u201coff \u2192 on\u201d event\n    could not have happened).  Hence at that moment all 23 prisoners have\n    visited, so the declaration is true.\n\n4.  Conversely, until every ordinary prisoner has visited, at least one of\n    them has not yet performed his single \u201coff \u2192 on\u201d action, so the total\n    of such actions is still below 22 and the leader\u2019s counter C is below\n    22.  Therefore the leader will not speak prematurely.\n\nWhy the declaration is eventually made\n\nThe warden\u2019s condition \u201cgiven enough time, everyone will eventually visit\nthe switch room as many times as everyone else\u201d guarantees that each\nordinary prisoner will sooner or later enter on a day when switch A is off;\nthe leader resets A to off infinitely often, so the opportunity will\neventually arise for every prisoner who still owes his signal.  Hence all\n22 signals will ultimately be sent, C will reach 22, and the leader will\nannounce.\n\nAll requirements are satisfied\n\n\u2022  Every visit results in exactly one switch being flipped.  \n\u2022  No communication other than the switches is needed after the first day.  \n\u2022  The strategy never risks an erroneous declaration, yet guarantees one in\n   finite time.\n\nFinal answer:  Designate one prisoner as leader.  Each of the other 22\nprisoners, the first time he ever enters the switch room and finds switch A\noff, turns A on; thereafter he always flips switch B.

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make.

The ten is next to at least one club.\n5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.\n6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.\n7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.\n8. My ace is not the card on the far left.\"\nThere was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, \"I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!\"\nThe other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.\nWhich suit is it?", "Hint": "The first step is to determine where the ace goes.\nAlso, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?", "Human Solution": "The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):\nX X Q X A\nX X X H X\nAt least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Howard\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Halfling  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Thief  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Dagger  \n\u2022 Monster speciality \u2013 Kobolds  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 10  \n\nLeonard\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Hobbit  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Merchant  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Crossbow  \n\u2022 Monster speciality \u2013 Orcs  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 16  \n\nPenny\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Elf  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Archbishop  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Bolo  \n\u2022 Monster speciality \u2013 Chimeras  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 20  \n\nRaj\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Gremlin  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Sorcerer  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Fireballs  \n\u2022 Monster speciality \u2013 Giants  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 32  \n\nSheldon\u2019s character  \n\u2022 Race \u2013 Ogre  \n\u2022 Occupation \u2013 Paladin  \n\u2022 Weapon \u2013 Mace  \n\u2022 Monster speciality \u2013 Harpies  \n\u2022 Skill level \u2013 24  \n\nFinal answer: Howard \u2013 Halfling thief (dagger, kobolds, level 10); Leonard \u2013 Hobbit merchant (crossbow, orcs, level 16); Penny \u2013 Elf archbishop (bolo, chimeras, level 20); Raj \u2013 Gremlin sorcerer (fireballs, giants, level 32); Sheldon \u2013 Ogre paladin (mace, harpies, level 24).", "Status": true}
{"ID": 7, "Question": "Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.\nWith your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?", "Hint": "Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?", "Human Solution": "First, ask the god standing in the middle, \"If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?\"\nBy phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel.

The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).\nWhich vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?", "Hint": "Start by deducing which vegetables pair with which dates ", "Human Solution": "Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.\nExplanation:\n1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.\nRadishes are 25th or 27th.\nPeppers are 28th or 30th.\n1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli\nBroccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)\n3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.\nLettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )\nTomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.\n2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.\nSaturday the 25th is East.\n1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden\nSo East, 25th is not Tomatoes.\nSo Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.\nAnd 3 days later 28th = peppers.\n3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).\nSo Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.\n1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.\nWest is 29th.\n3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.\nSo Lettuce is one or two rows.\n2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\nNorthwest is 2 or 4 rows.\n1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.\nRadishes are not one or five.\nBroccoli is not five or four.\nTomatoes is not one or two.\n2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.\nNorthwest is broccoli.\nLettuce has one row.\n2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.\nSo South is three rows.\nRadishes are four.\n3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.\nSo planted 3 in south on 28.\nFive rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.\nSummary:\nTomatoes, Five, 27th, North\nPeppers, Three, 28th, South\nRadishes, Four, 25th, East\nLettuce, one, 29th, West\nBroccoli, two, 30th, Northwest", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Tomatoes \u2013 five rows, planted on Monday May 27, in the west end of the garden.  \nPeppers \u2013 three rows, planted on Wednesday May 29, in the south side of the garden.  \nRadishes \u2013 four rows, planted on Saturday May 25, in the east side of the garden.  \nLettuce \u2013 two rows, planted on Thursday May 30, in the northwest corner of the garden.  \nBroccoli \u2013 one row, planted on Tuesday May 28, in the north end of the garden.", "Status": true}

Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.\n_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.\n_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).\nIn summary:\nBart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nJason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.\nRoger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

{"ID": 20, "Question": "The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?", "Hint": "Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.", "Human Solution": "Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

{"ID": 22, "Question": "The Situation:\nThere is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:\nIn the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).\nThe monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: \"white\" or \"black\". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right.

Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.\n2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.", "Human Solution": "Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words \"white\" and \"black\": The answer \"black\" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees.

This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.\nLet us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says \"white\".

If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1.

The rearmost islander (call him #10) will look at the nine hats in front of him and count how many of them are black. \u2011  If that number is EVEN he will say the word   \u201cwhite\u201d. \u2011  If that number is ODD   he will say the word   \u201cblack\u201d.  \n   (Thus his single word announces the parity \u2013 even or odd \u2013 of the number of black hats he sees.)\n\n2. Every later speaker (numbers 9, 8, \u2026, 1) will always keep in mind the parity that #10 announced and will continually update an \u201cobserved-parity\u201d as the game proceeds.\n\n   More precisely, just before a person has to speak he knows\n   \u2022 what the original parity was (from #10\u2019s word);  \n   \u2022 the true colours of every hat already dealt with (because after each guess the monster\u2019s reaction tells everyone whether that guess was right or wrong);  \n   \u2022 the colours of all hats still in front of him (because he sees them).\n\n   He therefore knows exactly how many black hats have already been removed from the line and how many black hats are still visible in front.  \n   From this he can deduce what his own colour must be in order to make the combined total of black hats that were originally visible to #10 have the parity announced by #10.  \n   He then says that colour, which is guaranteed to be correct.\n\nExample  \nSuppose the hats from front to back are  \n     1 W\u20032 B\u20033 W\u20034 B\u20035 B\u20036 B\u20037 W\u20038 W\u20039 B\u200310 ?  \n#10 sees five black hats (odd) and therefore says \u201cblack\u201d.  \nIf #10\u2019s own hat happens to be white he is eaten, but everyone now knows \u201coriginal parity = odd\u201d.  \nPerson 9 sees four black hats in front (even). For the total to stay odd his own hat must be black, so he says \u201cblack\u201d and survives.  \nPerson 8 now knows there are five known black hats (odd) behind him and sees three black hats in front (odd); the total is even, so his own hat must be white. He says \u201cwhite\u201d and survives.  \nAnd so on \u2013 everyone from #9 down to #1 will live.\n\nWhy this is optimal\n\n\u2022 Only one word can be uttered by #10; that word can carry at most one bit of information.  \n\u2022 Yet the ten possible configurations of his own hat (black/white) paired with the nine hats in front represent two equally likely possibilities for him. With no visual information about his own head, no strategy can let #10 be certain; his chance of living can be at most \u00bd.  \n\u2022 Our scheme lets each of the other nine people be absolutely certain, so exactly one person is in danger and the other nine are safe.  \nTherefore no strategy can guarantee more than nine survivors, and this strategy attains that bound; it is optimal.\n\nSurvival summary\n\nGuaranteed survivors: 9  \nExpected survivors: 9 \u00bd (because #10 survives with probability \u00bd).\n\nFinal answer:  The first speaker announces the parity (odd/even) of the black hats he sees; every later speaker keeps a running parity count and states the unique colour that restores the announced parity.

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:\nRoom 1\nCEO\nIT Analyst\nABM delegate\nGrimaldi\nCarl\nReed Right delegate\nRoom 2\nEdgar\nDeveloper\nThomas\nClarkson\nSince the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.\nNow this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:\nThe CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves.

All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won.

Y. Athletic, Jamie, 5, Lottie, 4\nThe final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round.

{"ID": 37, "Question": "On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.\nHow many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.\nIf there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "Let R be the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves present on the evening when the Master makes his announcement.  \nBecause the statement  \n\n\u2003\u201cthere is at least one red hat and at least one blue hat\u201d  \n\nis common knowledge, every dwarf knows that every other dwarf \u2026 knows it, and so on.  \nWe analyse what happens for each possible value of R.\n\n1.  Base case \u2009 R = 1  \n\u2003The unique red-hatted dwarf sees 99 blue hats and no red ones.  \n\u2003Since he nevertheless knows a red hat must exist, he realises at once that he himself is the red-hatted dwarf and does not return the next evening.  \n\u2003Thus all red hats disappear after 1 day.\n\n2.  Inductive step  \n\u2003Assume that if exactly k red hats are present, all of them leave together after k days.  \n\u2003Now suppose R = k + 1.  \n\u2003Each red-hatted dwarf sees exactly k red hats among the others.  \n\u2003He reasons:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u201cIf my own hat were blue, the situation visible to those k red-hatted dwarves would be exactly the one covered by the induction hypothesis (namely, there would be k red hats in total).  \n\u2003\u2003Therefore each of those k dwarves would discover his redness and leave on night k.  \n\u2003\u2003If, however, night k passes and those k dwarves are still present, the only possible explanation is that my assumption was wrong\u2014my hat cannot be blue. It must be red.\u201d\n\n\u2003When night k passes uneventfully, every red-hatted dwarf reaches that conclusion, and all k + 1 of them stay away on night k + 1.  \n\u2003Hence, with k + 1 red hats, they all depart after k + 1 days.\n\n3.  Conclusion  \n\u2003By mathematical induction, if the initial number of red hats is R, then all red-hatted dwarves leave after exactly R days.\n\nSince the forest contains 100 dwarves and at least one of them wears a blue hat, 1 \u2264 R \u2264 99.  \nTherefore the process lasts\n\n\u2003\u2022 exactly R days,  \n\u2003\u2022 at most 99 days in the worst case.\n\nFinal answer:  after exactly R days, where R is the initial number of red-hatted dwarves (so no more than 99 days).", "Status": true}

So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4.

The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside.

Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.\nOn fourth thought (the economics):\nIf the engineering balance is \"close to equilibrium\", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "The plan is not reasonable.\n\nReasoning  \n\n1.

Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.\nCompany A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, \"Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.

{"ID": 61, "Question": "In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.\nThe pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.\nWhat exactly happened there?", "Hint": "Focus on the fact that stronger poison neutralizes weak poison", "Human Solution": "The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison. As his own poison he would bring water, which will have no effect on him, but the pharmacist who would drink the water, and then his poison would surely die. When the pharmacist figured out this plan, he decided to bring water as well. So the treasurer who drank poison earlier, drank the pharmacist's water, then his own water, and died of the poison he drank before. The pharmacist would drink only water, so nothing will happen to him. And because both of them brought the king water, he didn't get a strong poison like he wanted.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.

For each team, there were:\n[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.\n[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.\n[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.\n[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.\n[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.\nThe Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.

The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.", "Human Solution": "The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.\n[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:\nPrime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]\nSquare - 0,4,9 [2 games each]\nNeither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]\nSince all of the \"neither prime nor square\" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 \"prime or square\" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.\n[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.\nWe now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).\nTherefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.\nSince Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower?

So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).\n8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous\n9. It can eat the flower.

Snap looks at his own number S and is immediately certain that Crackle and Pop have *different* numbers.  \n    \u2022  That is possible only if the sum of Crackle\u2019s and Pop\u2019s numbers, 14 \u2013 S, is *odd* (otherwise they could both be half of that even sum).  \n    \u2022  Therefore 14 \u2013 S is odd, so S itself is odd.\n\n2.  Crackle says he already knew that *all three* numbers were different, just from seeing his own number C.  \n    \u2022  For him to be sure the other two could not be equal to each other we again need 14 \u2013 C to be odd, so C is also odd.  \n    \u2022  For him to be sure that neither of the others could equal his number, the equation 14 \u2013 2C = 0 or > 0 must be impossible; hence 14 \u2013 2C \u2264 0, i.e. C \u2265 7.  \n    \u2022  So C is an odd integer at least 7: 7, 9, 11 or 13.\n\n3.  Pop, after hearing the first two remarks, now knows the *exact* triple of numbers.  \n    \u2022  Let Pop\u2019s number be P.  He knows\n           S + C = 14 \u2013 P,\u2003with\u2003S odd,\u2003C odd \u2265 7.\n    \u2022  Check every value of P (1 \u2264 P \u2264 13).  The only time the equation admits *exactly one* pair (S, C) that meets the conditions is when P = 6:\n           14 \u2013 6 = 8, and the *only* way to write 8 as \u201codd + odd \u2265 7\u2019\u2019 is 1 + 7.\n    \u2022  Thus Pop must have 6, Crackle 7 and Snap 1.\n\n4.  Because Pop\u2019s announcement that he now knows all three numbers can only be justified when P = 6, Gretchen can deduce the same unique solution:\n\nSnap\u2003=\u20031  \nCrackle = 7  \nPop\u2003\u2003=\u20036  \n\nHence Gretchen could state the contents of all three envelopes correctly.\n\nFinal answer: Snap has 1, Crackle has 7, and Pop has 6.", "Status": true}

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.

She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

{"ID": 148, "Question": "There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

Then Q1 says Al is the landlord in apt 1.  \nBecause Dan must be somewhere east of 1, \u201cDan east of Al\u2019\u2019 is true, so P4 is true and again Q4 would give Ben as landlord\u2014a contradiction.  \nHence P1 is false:\u2003Carl is next to Ben.                                           (6)\n\nStep 3.  Decide whether Ben is next to Dan.  \nSuppose Ben IS next to Dan (so P3 is false).  \nTogether with (6) Ben would then be next to both Carl and Dan; that forces Ben to live in apt 2 or 3.  \n\u2022  If Ben were in 2, Carl and Dan would have to occupy 1 and 3; then Al would be forced into 4, putting Al east of Carl and contradicting (5).  \n\u2022  If Ben were in 3, Carl and Dan would have to occupy 2 and 4; Al would have to be in 1, and Dan would again be east of Al, making P4 true and giving a second (contradictory) landlord.  \nBoth possibilities are impossible, so Ben cannot be next to Dan. Thus\n\nP3 is true and Q3 applies:\u2003Carl is the landlord and he lives in apt 3.             (7)\n\nStep 4.  Verify that the required arrangement exists and obeys all four statements.  \nTake  \npos(Dan)=1,\u2003pos(Al)=2,\u2003pos(Carl)=3,\u2003pos(Ben)=4.\n\n\u2022  Carl (3) is next to Ben (4)\u2003\u2192 P1 false, so (1) satisfied.  \n\u2022  Al (2) is west of Carl (3)\u2003\u2192 P2 false, so (2) satisfied.  \n\u2022  Ben (4) is NOT next to Dan (1)\u2003\u2192 P3 true, Q3 satisfied (Carl landlord in 3).  \n\u2022  Dan (1) is west of Al (2)\u2003\u2192 P4 false, so (4) satisfied.\n\nAll statements are fulfilled with Carl as the unique landlord.\n\nTherefore, the landlord must be Carl.\n\nFinal answer: Carl", "Status": true}

On the way to the stadium, they realize that exactly half of them are fans of one team and the other half are fans of the other team. With still some way to go before reaching the stadium, the bus develops mechanical problems and the driver announces to his passengers that the only way to continue the journey is for half of them to get out and walk. There is a huge fight that doesn't stop until the driver speaks to them again and suggests a way of selecting the passengers who are to get off the bus.\n\"All of you,\" he said, \"get into a big circle.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

From clue 4, place the dog in 2A.\n\nStep 2.  Clue 6 says the monkey is directly above or below the dog, hence in 1A or 3A.  \nClue 2 requires row 3 to contain two animals whose names begin with the same letter; the only possible duplicated initials are H (horse, hamster) or M (monkey, mouse).  \nIf monkey were in 1A, neither of these two-of-a-kind pairs could still fit in row 3, so monkey must be in 3A and row 3 will need mouse as its partner.  \nNow clue 3 puts horse in the same row as monkey, i.e. also in row 3.\n\nRow 3 now contains monkey, mouse, horse.\n\nStep 3.  Still using clue 2, column C must also contain two animals with the same initial.  \nIf horse is put in 3C, a second H-animal (hamster) can join it in column C; if horse were in 3B instead, no duplicated initial could be achieved in column C.  \nHence fix\n\n\u2003\u20033C = horse\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003hamster will go somewhere else in column C.\n\nThus row 3 is: 3A monkey, 3B mouse, 3C horse.\n\nStep 4.  Put hamster into column C.  We shall try 1C and 2C in turn.\n\n(a)  Hamster in 1C  \n\u2003Then clue 1 forces bear into row 1; the only free place there is 1A.  \n\u2003But 1A is above the dog, contradicting clue 5 (cat must have lion/tiger beneath it), so hamster cannot be in 1C.\n\n(b)  Hamster in 2C  \n\u2003Now bear must be in the same row as hamster, i.e. in row 2.  \n\u2003Row 2 already has dog in 2A; the only empty cells in that row are 2B and 2C, but 2C is hamster, so bear would have to be 2B.  \n\u2003Yet clue 5 says the animal under the cat must be lion or tiger, so 2B cannot be bear.  \n\u2003Therefore hamster must actually be in 1C, and 1A = bear is acceptable after all once we choose a correct place for the cat (see the next step).  \n\u2003(Checking again shows there is no contradiction; the earlier objection disappears when cat is placed in 1B.)\n\nSo fix: 1A = bear, 1C = hamster.\n\nStep 5.  Place the cat.  By clue 5 it must have lion or tiger directly beneath it; hence cat cannot be in column A (dog is there) nor in column C (hamster beneath).  \nThe only workable square is 1B, making 2B the required lion/tiger.\n\nStep 6.  Decide which of lion or tiger is in 2B.  \nClue 7 forbids tiger next to the dog, and dog is in 2A, adjacent horizontally to 2B.  \nTherefore 2B cannot be tiger; it must be the lion, leaving tiger for the only remaining empty square, 2C.\n\nStep 7.

VAT  \n   For Ben to have known, he must have had T (now unique), leaving Carl with A again.  \n   As in the previous case, the two words PAD and VAT remain possible for Carl,\n   so he could **not** be certain \u2013 contradiction.\n\nThe only word that allows Carl to answer \u201cYes\u201d truthfully is HOE.\n\n\n\nConclusion: the unique word consistent with the three affirmative answers is\n\nHOE.", "Status": true}

If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1.

Why a single plank will do  \n   \u2022 The 2 \u00d7 4 laid flat is about 8.9 cm wide (3.5 in.) and 5 m (500 cm) long.  \n   \u2022 The wires are 8 cm apart and are all parallel.  \n   \u2022 If the plank is put down perpendicular to the wires it crosses\n     500 cm \u00f7 8 cm \u2248 62 wires.  \n   \u2022 Carlo, his clothes, the plank and the tools weigh less than 80 kg.  \n     80 kg \u00f7 62 \u2248 1.3 kg borne by any one wire \u2013 far below the 4 kg limit.  \n   Thus, while Carlo is standing on the plank the alarm cannot be tripped.\n\n2.  Making the plank easy to move  \n   With the saw he cut two narrow slots through the plank about 50 cm from each\n   end.  He passed the four 2-m leather straps through those slots and tied the\n   free ends together to form two large continuous loops \u2013 one loop near each end\n   of the plank.  They serve as \u201chandles\u201d that can be grasped or pulled with a\n   foot.\n\n3.

His weight is now shared by the whole 5-m length resting on\n     \u2248 62 wires.\n\n   Step B \u2013 Advancing the rear end  \n   \u2022 While still standing on the forward three metres of plank he reached back\n     with a strap-loop and pulled the rear metre of plank forward, sliding it\n     over the carpet until it protruded in front of him.  \n   \u2022 Even while that rear portion is sliding, at least 3 m of plank (\u2248 37 wires)\n     remain under him, so each wire still carries < 3 kg.\n\n   Step C \u2013 Repeat  \n   \u2022 He now walked forward again to a point about 2 m from the (new) front end,\n     pulled the back end forward once more, and repeated the manoeuvre.  \n   \u2022 Three such moves (15 m \u00f7 effective 4 m stride \u2248 4) carried him from the\n     doorway to the pedestal in the centre of the 15 m room.\n\n4.  Taking the diamond  \n   Standing on the plank beside the 1-m pedestal, he used the hammer to smash\n   the glass cube, removed the diamond, put it in a pocket, and then worked his\n   way back to the door by reversing the same \u201cwalk-the-plank\u201d sequence.\n\nAt every moment of the operation Carlo\u2019s weight (plus the plank and the loot)\nwas spread over no fewer than about thirty wires, so no individual wire ever\nfelt even half of the 4 kg that would have triggered the alarm.\n\nFinal answer: By laying his 5-m plank flat across the wires (perpendicular to them) Carlo distributed his weight over about 60 wires so that each carried only ~1 kg.  Remaining on the plank, he advanced it a metre at a time with the leather-strap loops, \u201cwalking\u201d the plank across the carpet to the pedestal, stole the diamond, and returned the same way, all without any wire ever receiving the 4 kg needed to set off the alarm.", "Status": true}

The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.\nSo far, we know this much:\n71-1?-17-??\nNow, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.\n71-1?-17-68\nNow we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.

Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.\n\"Honey, we're ready to eat.

As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.\nOnce everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, \"I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.\"\n\"You'd better not make any passes yourself!\" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.\n\"Lighten up, Farrah\" the biology major joked.  \"He wasn't even that cute.\"\n\"He was adorable!\" the youngest interjected.\n\"Everyone's entitled to their opinion,\" said Brooke.  \"Let's eat!\"\nThe daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, \"We have an announcement to make!\" After a dramatic pause she screamed \"we're getting married!\" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.

Behaviour of an ORDINARY prisoner when he is taken to the switch room\n\n   \u2022 If he has never sent his token yet AND switch A is OFF  \n       \u2013 He flips switch A from OFF to ON (this sends the token).  \n       \u2013 He now marks in his mind: \u201ctoken sent\u201d.\n\n   \u2022 In every other situation  \n       \u2013 He flips switch B (whatever its present state is, he reverses it).\n\n   Remark:  After an ordinary prisoner has already sent his token he will\n            never touch switch A again; from then on he always flips B.\n\nB. Behaviour of the LEADER when he is taken to the switch room\n\n   \u2022 If switch A is ON  \n       \u2013 He flips switch A back to OFF.  \n       \u2013 He increases his personal count by 1 (one token collected).\n\n   \u2022 If switch A is OFF  \n       \u2013 He flips switch B (to satisfy the rule that a switch must be moved).\n\n   \u2022 Whenever his count reaches 22 (one token from every ordinary\n     prisoner), he immediately tells the warden\n     \u201cAll 23 of us have visited the switch room.\u201d\n\nWhy the declaration is always correct\n\n\u2022 A token can be created only when an ordinary prisoner finds A = OFF and\n  turns it ON.  An ordinary prisoner does this at most once in his life.\n  Therefore at most 22 tokens can ever be created.\n\n\u2022 A token can be removed (switch A turned back OFF) only by the Leader,\n  and each time he removes it he reliably adds 1 to his count.\n\n\u2022 Consequently the Leader\u2019s count is exactly the number of ordinary\n  prisoners who have already visited the room at least once.\n\n\u2022 When the Leader\u2019s count becomes 22, every ordinary prisoner has visited\n  the room, and, of course, the Leader himself has also visited.\n  Hence all 23 prisoners have been in the switch room, so the statement\n  he makes is true.\n\nWhy the declaration is eventually made\n\nBecause the warden is assumed to keep bringing every prisoner back\ninfinitely many times (assumption C), every ordinary prisoner will\neventually encounter the room with switch A = OFF before he has sent his\ntoken; at that moment he sends it.  Therefore the Leader\u2019s count will\neventually grow to 22, and the declaration will be made.\n\nThus the prisoners have a guaranteed winning strategy.\n\nFinal answer:  Yes.  By designating one prisoner as Leader, using switch A\nas a token switch and switch B as a harmless \u201cspare\u201d, and following the\nrules above, they can be certain that the Leader will declare \u201call of us\nhave visited\u201d only when it is true, and that he will eventually do so,\nthereby ensuring their release.", "Status": true}

The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).\nGiven the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?\n Hint: It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Hint": "It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.", "Human Solution": "199.\nFirst, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).\nNow, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.\nFor a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.\nExamining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).\nUsing the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000.

That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):\nK J Q T A\nX D X H X\nNow we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?\nI held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.\nBut which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.\nTherefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.\nTherefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.

The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.\n11. Raj's character isn't the elf.\n12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.\n13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.\n Hint: Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Hint": "Start by determining the 5 skill levels.", "Human Solution": "Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.\nLeonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.\nPenny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.\nRaj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.\nSheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.\nExplanation:\nThe first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.\nThe lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).\nFrom (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.\nThe elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.\nOne skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).\nIf x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.\nIf x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.\nTherefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.\nNow that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = thief\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nSince the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = orcs\nNeither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:\nPlayer 1 = Penny\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin\nPlayer 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThis means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nThe hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow\nLeonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:\nPlayer 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo\nPlayer 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace\nPlayer 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger\nPlayer 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs\nPlayer 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow\nHoward's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds.

{"ID": 7, "Question": "Question: Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.\nHere, you are approached by three gods and their herald.\nProblem\nOn the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.\nFirst, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.\nSecond, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.\nFinally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment.

As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (\"would you say ja?\") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.\nIf the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.\nSimilarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.\nThe next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, \"If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?\" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: \"no I would not say yes,\" even though he would; or \"yes I would say no,\" even though he wouldn't.)\nFinally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, \"If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?\" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified).

{"ID": 8, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.\n1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.\n2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.\n3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.

{"ID": 11, "Question": "Question: Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?\n1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.\n2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.\n3.

The five working days are 25 May (Sat), 27 May (Mon), 28 May (Tue), 29 May (Wed) and 30 May (Thu).  \n    Sunday 26 May is a non-working day.\n\n2.  \u201cOn one week\u2019s last day Mad Ade planted the east side.\u201d  \n    \u21d2  The east side was planted on Saturday 25 May.\n\n3.  \u201cMad Ade planted four-row beds, then three-row beds, then two-row beds.  \n    The three-row bed is the south side and is one day before the lettuce bed.  \n    Lettuce has <3 rows.\u201d  \n    \u21d2  Rows-4 bed must be 25 May, the rows-3 (south) bed two days later and the rows-2 (lettuce) bed the day after that:  \n        25 May \u2026\u2026 rows 4  \n        29 May \u2026\u2026 rows 3 (south)  \n        30 May \u2026\u2026 rows 2 (lettuce)\n\n4.

Since 29 May is already the rows-3 south bed, peppers are the south-side, three-row crop.\n\n7.  Therefore radishes are the 25 May east-side, four-row crop.\n\n8.  \u201cRadish rows deeper than broccoli but not as deep as tomatoes.\u201d  \n    With radishes on 4 rows, broccoli must have <4 rows and tomatoes >4 rows.  \n    Unique row numbers 1\u20135 are still available: 1,5.\n\n9.  \u201cPeppers have more rows than broccoli,\u201d so broccoli cannot have 3 rows; it must therefore have 1 row, leaving 5 rows for tomatoes.\n\n10.  \u201cBroccoli was not planted on the 29th, nor in the west side.\u201d  \n     The only unassigned dates are 27 May and 28 May.  \n     The wheel-barrow clue: \u201cHe rolled the barrow into the west end one day before he planted broccoli,\u201d so the west-side bed is one day earlier than broccoli.\n\n     \u2022 If broccoli were 27 May, west-side date would be 26 May (no work) \u2013 impossible.  \n     \u2022 Hence broccoli is 28 May, and the west-side bed is 27 May.\n\n11.

{"ID": 16, "Question": "Question: The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?\n1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.\n2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.\n3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.\n4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).\n5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.\n6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.\n7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).\n8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.\n9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.\n10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.\n Hint: In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Hint": "In case you need all the kid's names:\nThe boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.\nThe girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.\nThe last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.", "Human Solution": "From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:\n_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.\nBart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.\n_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.\nPatty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.

Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.\n_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nBart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.\n_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.\n_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.\nThe only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).\nIn summary:\nBart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.\nStacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.\nJason Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a Destroyer.\nRoger Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.\nGeorgia Roon beat Lila Peach by a Patrol Boat.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

{"ID": 20, "Question": "Question: The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.\nThe conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.\nY wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:\nMs. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.\nMr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.\nMr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.\nMs. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.\nMr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.\nMr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.\nMr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.\nMs. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.\nMr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.\nMs. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.\nThe bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.\n\"But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?\" the conductor protested. \"You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!\"\n\"To the contrary, my good man,\" the detective answered placidly. \"It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.\"\nWho did Detective Y arrest?\n Hint: Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise.

(R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.\nThus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.\nBecause G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.\nMs. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.\nDetective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.\nA prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.\nMr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}

Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:\nRoom 1\nCEO\nIT Analyst\nABM delegate\nGrimaldi\nCarl\nReed Right delegate\nRoom 2\nEdgar\nDeveloper\nThomas\nClarkson\nSince the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.\nNow this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:\nThe CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right.

The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match.

All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club.

The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).\nThere were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.\nThis leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.\nThis means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).\nFrom clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.\nIslip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.\nFrom clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).\nWhite is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.\nFrom clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.\nFrom clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.\nSince Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.\nLottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.\nIn the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.\nFrom clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.\nFrom clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.\nRegina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.\nRegina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.\nKristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.\nLottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.\nLottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).\nBills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round.

The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.\nOf the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.\nEach night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.\nNow, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes.

Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat.

This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let R be the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves.  \nThe solution is the classical \u201cinduction on what everybody sees and what everybody knows everybody sees\u201d.\n\nStep 0 \u2013 What every dwarf sees the first night  \n\u2022 A red-hatted dwarf sees R-1 red hats among the other 99 dwarves.  \n\u2022 A blue-hatted dwarf sees R   red hats among the other 99 dwarves.  \nAll dwarves also heard the public announcement \u201cthere is at least one red hat and one blue hat, and as soon as you know that your own hat is red you must stay home.\u201d\n\nStep 1 \u2013 What would happen if R = 1?  \nIf there were exactly one red hat, that lone red dwarf would see zero red hats.  \nSince everyone was told there is at least one red hat, seeing none implies \u201cmy hat must be red.\u201d  \nTherefore a single red-hatted dwarf would stay home the very next morning.  \nObservation: If the first morning arrives and every dwarf is still present, all dwarves can eliminate the possibility R = 1.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 What would happen if R = 2?  \nEach of the two red dwarves sees exactly one red hat.  \nFrom his point of view there are two possibilities:  \n(a) R = 1 (the red hat he sees) or  \n(b) R = 2 (the other red plus himself).  \nHe therefore waits one day to see whether the other red-hat leaves.  \n\u2022 If the other red-hat had left on the first morning, he would conclude case (a) was true and that his own hat is blue.  \n\u2022 If the other red-hat does NOT leave (which is what actually happens when R = 2), both red-hatted dwarves realise \u201ccase (a) was impossible, so my hat must also be red.\u201d  \nConsequently they both stay home on the second morning.  \nObservation: If the second morning arrives and at least one red hat is still at the feast, everyone can eliminate the possibilities R = 1 and R = 2.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Induction for general R  \nSuppose there are R red hats.  \nEvery red-hatted dwarf sees R-1 red hats and reasons exactly as above:  \n\u2022 \u201cIf there were only 1 red hat, it would disappear on day 1.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cIf there were exactly 2 red hats, they would both disappear on day 2.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u2026  \n\u2022 \u201cIf there were exactly (R-1) red hats, they would all disappear on day (R-1).\u201d  \nWhen the first R-1 mornings pass and nobody with a red hat has left, all red-hatted dwarves can rule out every possibility smaller than R and conclude \u201cthere must be R red hats, which means I am one of them.\u201d  \nTherefore every red-hatted dwarf stays home on the R-th morning, and from that day on only blue-hatted dwarves attend the feast.\n\nConclusion  \nThe number of days until no red-hatted dwarf attends the party equals the number R of red hats.  Since the problem only states that at least one red and one blue hat exist, R could be any integer from 1 to 99, so the exodus of red hats could take anywhere from 1 to 99 days.\n\nFinal answer: After exactly R days\u2014where R is the (initial) number of red-hatted dwarves\u2014all the red-hatted dwarves have figured it out and stopped coming to the feast.", "Status": true}

More friends are finding out about this military fun and want to join, Private Brianna and Private Ben have come into this group too. Today the friends will be running 3 laps around the park. At the end of the race, the friends will move up or down in ranks according on how they did. If you can't move up or down any ranks, you will stay in the same rank that you are currently in. The scoring will be as follows\n1st Place- Move up 5 ranks\n2nd Place- Move up 4 ranks\n3rd Place- Move up 3 ranks\n4th and 5th Places- Move up 1 rank each\n6th and 7th Places- Stay the same rank\n8th and 9th Places- Move down 1 rank each\n10th and 11th Places- Move down 2 ranks each\n12th Place- Move down 3 ranks\nThe ranks people have right now:\nLieutenant General Stephen\nColonel Anna\nMajor Felicia\nCaptain Clark\nSergeant Abby\nSergeant Brad\nCorporal Jessica\nPrivate Paul\nPrivate Kelsey\nPrivate Luke\nPrivate Brianna\nPrivate Ben\nThis is a list of the ranks again, just in case anyone forgot it.\nRanks\n1.

Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.\nIn the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.\nThe Second Lap:\nPaul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front.

E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nLet's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4.

So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.\nIf I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.\nThis means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4.

When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.

B therefore attaches time\n   schedules to the three figures:\n\n         $200 000  \u2013  the bridge will be finished in 4 years;  \n         $750 000  \u2013  the bridge will be finished in 18 months;  \n         $1 000 000 \u2013  the bridge will be finished in 6 months\n                       and will come with a 20-year full warranty.\n\n   (Nothing here is dishonest; each schedule is perfectly feasible.  \n   B can always have A do the physical work for $800 000 and simply vary the\n   size of the crew and the amount of overtime he is willing to pay.)\n\n4.  Now do the accounting from the Emperor\u2019s point of view.\n\n      \u2022 The ferry service is losing the country about $30 000 a month  \n        in subsidy and lost tourist revenue.  \n      \u2022 Waiting 18 extra months instead of 6 therefore costs  \n        18 \u00d7 $30 000 = $540 000.  \n        That is more than the $250 000 price saving obtained by picking the\n        $750 000 alternative instead of the $1 000 000 alternative.\n\n      \u2022 Waiting the full 4 years instead of 6 months would cost  \n        42 \u00d7 $30 000 = $1 260 000, far more than the extra $800 000 that\n        would be saved by choosing the $200 000 contract.\n\n   When the numbers are put in front of him the Emperor sees that the\n   \u201c$1 000 000 finished-in-six-months\u201d contract is actually the cheapest\n   in real, economic terms.\n\n5.  Consequently the Emperor \u201cimmediately accepted\u201d the $1 000 000 option.\n   Company B then hired Company A for the original $800 000, paid them, and\n   pocketed the $200 000 difference\u2014perfectly openly and honestly.\n\nWhy the offer sounded good  \n\u2022 The Emperor was given what looked like freedom of choice, together with a\n  convincing financial analysis showing that the rapid-completion,\n  higher-price alternative saved him the most money overall.  \n\nHow Company B ended up with the highest amount  \n\u2022 Because B structured the proposal so that rational, economic\n  self-interest made the Emperor pick the $1 000 000 alternative;  \n  B then subcontracted the physical work to A for $800 000 and retained\n  the remaining $200 000 as profit.\n\nFinal answer: Company B offered three prices tied to three different completion times.  A quick completion (worth far more than the extra $250 000) cost $1 000 000, a medium-speed job $750 000, and a slow job $200 000.  The Emperor\u2019s accountants showed that the fast bridge saved the country the most money overall, so he chose the $1 000 000 option.  B hired A for $800 000 to do the actual construction and kept the $200 000 difference, all perfectly honestly.", "Status": true}

Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:\n[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.\n[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.\n[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.\n[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.\n[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.\nThe Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.

We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.\n[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying \"there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.\"\n[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:\nPrime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]\nSquare - 0,4,9 [2 games each]\nNeither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]\nSince all of the \"neither prime nor square\" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 \"prime or square\" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.\n[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.\nWe now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd.

{"ID": 111, "Question": "Question: Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.\nUnfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.\nBut in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.\nBut this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.\nBut the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.\nUnfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.\nLet's sum up the assumptions:\n1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.\n2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.\n3. The flower doesn't want to die.\n4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.\n5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.\n6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n7. The dog is rational.\n8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.\n9. The dog doesn't want to die.\n10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).\n11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.\n12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.\n13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.\n14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.\n15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.\nSo now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?\n Hint:  1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.\nHint 2:\nSince the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Hint": " 1:\nWe know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten.

Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.", "Human Solution": "The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)\nBut why will the dog eat the flower?\n1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die\n2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.\n3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.\n4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.\n5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.\n6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.\n7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison\nOK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11).

She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.\n**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.\n**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.\n**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.\n*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?\n Hint: nan", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.\nNow let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.\nAnd that's that.

Now N = 99/3 = 33 lb.  \n    Norma must have bought two pieces whose weights add to 33 lb.  \n    Among the Kebabrie pieces {15, 16, 18, 19, 31} the only such pair is 15 lb + 18 lb.\n\n    Laura then buys the remaining three Kebabrie pieces 16 lb, 19 lb, and 31 lb, whose total is 66 lb = 2 \u00d7 33 lb, exactly twice Norma\u2019s purchase.\n\nEverything is consistent, so the single unsold piece\u2014the Chillirella\u2014weighs 20 pounds.\n\nFinal answer: 20", "Status": true}

Whose 47th birthday falls on 1 May of a non-leap year?  \n    The two birth years are 1932 and 1933.\n\n       \u2022  Someone born 1 May 1932 turns 47 on 1 May 1979.  \n         (1979 is not a leap year, so everything fits.)  \n       \u2022  Someone born 1 May 1933 turns 47 on 1 May 1980.  \n         But 1980 is a leap year, contradicting point 3.\n\n    Hence the friend whose 47th birthday is being mentioned (Smoe) must be the one born in 1932.\n\nSo Smoe is the elder (born May 1932), and Joe is one year younger (born May 1933).\n\nFinal answer: Smoe is older than Joe.", "Status": true}

The simple \u201clook at one other hat\u201d rule no longer guarantees the needed all-right/all-wrong outcome.\n\nSo we need a property that every prisoner can compute from what he sees that stays related in exactly the same way for all of them, no matter how many prisoners there are.  The natural such property is PARITY (whether the number of something is even or odd).\n\nStep 3 \u2013 The common strategy (works for any number N \u2265 1)  \n\nAgreed beforehand:\n\n\u2003\u201cCount how many BLACK hats you can see.  \n\u2003If the number you see is EVEN, announce \u2018WHITE\u2019.  \n\u2003If the number you see is ODD,  announce \u2018BLACK\u2019.\u201d\n\n(Any consistent swapping of the words \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 would work as well; they just have to decide it together in advance.)\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Why the strategy always frees them  \n\nLet T be the total number of black hats actually on all heads (chosen by the warden).  \n\nCase 1: T is EVEN  \n\u2022 A prisoner whose own hat is white sees exactly T black hats (even) \u2192 he says \u2018white\u2019 \u2192 correct.  \n\u2022 A prisoner whose own hat is black sees T\u22121 black hats (odd) \u2192 he says \u2018black\u2019 \u2192 correct.  \nThus every prisoner speaks the correct colour. They are all right \u21d2 they go free.\n\nCase 2: T is ODD  \n\u2022 A prisoner whose own hat is white sees T black hats (odd) \u2192 he says \u2018black\u2019 \u2192 wrong.  \n\u2022 A prisoner whose own hat is black sees T\u22121 black hats (even) \u2192 he says \u2018white\u2019 \u2192 wrong.  \nThus every prisoner speaks the incorrect colour. They are all wrong \u21d2 they go free.\n\nTherefore, whether the warden makes the total number of black hats even or odd, the prisoners\u2019 joint answers are either all correct (even case) or all incorrect (odd case). Either outcome satisfies the warden\u2019s condition for release.\n\nStep 5 \u2013 Why the warden cannot spoil it  \nThe warden hears the strategy but can only choose the hat placement. Whatever placement he chooses has a definite parity, and the analysis above shows that parity forces the prisoners\u2019 guesses to be uniformly right or uniformly wrong. Hence the warden has no counter-move.\n\nFinal answer: Each prisoner counts the number of black hats he can see. If that number is even he guesses his own hat is white; if it is odd he guesses it is black.

{"ID": 193, "Question": "Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.\nYou quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...\n Hint: nan", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.\nWhat else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!

Eventually, when 101 eggs remain, the opponent must take x (1\u2013100) and you immediately take the remaining 101 \u2212 x eggs and win.\n\nTherefore the whole problem reduces to this:\n\nChoose an initial move k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) such that  \n2008 \u2212 k \u2261 0 (mod 101).\n\nCompute 2008 mod 101  \n101\u00b719 = 1919  \n2008 \u2212 1919 = 89 \u21d2 2008 \u2261 89 (mod 101).\n\nHence we need k \u2261 89 (mod 101).  \nThe only such k in the allowed range 1\u2013100 is k = 89.\n\nVerification  \nAfter taking 89 eggs, 2008 \u2212 89 = 1919 = 101\u00b719 are left.  \nFrom then on play the \u201ccomplement to 101\u2019\u2019 reply every turn; this guarantees the last move.\n\nFinal answer: 89", "Status": true}

One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.\nTorks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:\nNorris McDim:\nA) I did not leave the door open.\nB) Morris was the one who did it.\nNobby Shifty:\nA) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.\nB) Norris was on duty.\nMorris the Daft:\nA) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.\nB) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.\nRobby O'Mental:\nA) I did not leave the door open.\nB) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.\nConsidering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?\n Hint: nan", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Robby left the door open.\nThe one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.\nThere are only 3 truthful statements.\nIf Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.\nIf Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.\nIf Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.\nIn Robby's case, in detail:\nNorris A True\nB False\nNobby A True\nB False\nMorris A False\nB True\nDave A False\nB False (why did he bother to leave the\ncell door open?)", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "Let  \n\nD = guard who was on duty that evening (and who therefore left the cell-door open).\n\nFor each guard write down his two statements and translate them into facts about D (the two \u201cmental-state\u2019\u2019 statements will be dealt with later).\n\n1.

Evaluate S\u2084 and S\u2085.\n\nBecause S\u2081 and S\u2082 are both true, 0 of them are lying.  \n\u2022 S\u2084 (\u201cexactly one of them is lying\u201d) is therefore false.  \n\u2022 S\u2085 (\u00acS\u2084) is true.  \n\nThe truth distribution is now:\n\nTrue : S\u2081, S\u2082, S\u2085\u2003\u2003(3 truths)  \nFalse: S\u2083, S\u2084\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(2 lies)\n\nThis satisfies Mother\u2019s condition.\n\nStep 6.

The room is 15 m \u00d7 15 m; the diamond is in the centre, 7.5 m from any wall.  \n    One 5-m board is therefore not long enough to reach the pedestal in a single span, but it is plenty long enough to let him \u201cwalk\u201d it forward.\n\nHow Will does it\n\n\u2022   He lays the 5-m 2\u00d74 flat on the carpet perpendicular to the alarm wires, steps onto the end that is nearest the door, and stands there.  \n\u2022   While his weight is safely supported, he lifts the rear end of the board, swings it forward and sets it down farther into the room.  \n\u2022   He walks to the new front end and repeats the operation.  \n    Each \u201cstride\u201d moves the board almost its whole length, so after two complete moves he has advanced just under 10 m; a third move puts him beside the pedestal in the centre (\u22487.5 m from the wall).\n\nThe leather straps are useful only for balance \u2013 he can loop one round his waist and the board when he has to bend down and pick the back end up \u2013 but they are not strictly necessary. The hammer (or the hammer head wrapped in carpet) is used to break the glass cover; the saw is never needed.\n\nWith the diamond in a pocket he makes the three board-moves in reverse and reaches the door, having never loaded any single wire with more than about 1\u00bc kg.\n\nFinal answer: He places the 5-metre board cross-wise on the floor, stands on it, and \u201cwalks\u201d it forward in three instalments, each time lifting the back end and setting it down in front. Because the board always rests simultaneously on more than sixty wires, no wire ever bears more than \u22481.2 kg, far below the 4 kg trip limit, so the alarm never goes off while he enters, removes the diamond, and leaves.", "Status": true}

The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then \u00bc(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then \u00bc(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation \u00bc(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.\nIf c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since \"couples\" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.\no+8o=9o.\nSo 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even.

{"ID": 249, "Question": "Question: Serena has received a box of chocolates as a birthday present. The box contains 12 chocolates of different shapes (one is hemispherical) and flavours (four of which are: dark chocolate, white chocolate-hazelnut, tiramisu and milk chocolate-cherry). The 12 chocolates are divided into three rows of 4 chocolate per line. With the help of the clues and the drawing, can you figure out the shape, the flavour and the position in the box of each chocolate?\n1. The following four chocolates are in the same row (but not necessarily in this\norder): the flower-shaped chocolate (which isn't gianduia flavour), the dark\nchocolate-orange chocolate (which isn't pentagonal-shaped), the chocolate just below the white chocolate and the heart-shaped milk chocolate-cognac flavoured chocolate.\n2. Every row contains only one chocolate made from dark chocolate and only one\nfrom milk chocolate and they aren't next to each other.\n3. The cremino flavoured chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped chocolate and just above the trapezoid-shaped one.\n4. The hexagonal-shaped chocolate is just below the dark chocolate-orange one and is in the same row as the dark chocolate-hazelnut one but further to the right.\n5. Both the caramel chocolate and the square-shaped chocolate (which isn't made from dark chocolate) are in the central part of the box but neither in the same row nor one below the other.\n6. The round chocolate (which isn't dark chocolate-orange flavour) is further to the left than the pentagonal-shaped chocolate (which isn't #4) but further to the right than the gianduia flavoured one. These three chocolates are in different rows.\n7. Chocolate #5 isn't the cremino flavoured chocolate. The two white-chocolate chocolates are in the first two rows. The rectangular-shaped chocolate is next to the oval-shaped milk chocolate. Chocolate #9 isn't rhombus-shaped. The triangularshaped\nchocolate is #1.\n Hint: nan", "Hint": NaN, "Human Solution": "Solution:\nPosition - Shape - Flavour\n1 - Triangular - Dark chocolate\n2 - Square - Gianduia\n3 - Rectangular - White chocolate\n4 - Oval - Milk chocolate\n5 - Flower - White chocolate-hazelnut\n6 - Rhombus - Dark chocolate-orange\n7 - Round - Cremino\n8 - Heart - Milk chocolate-cognac\n9 - Hemispherical - Dark chocolate hazelnut\n10 - Hexagonal - Tiramisu\n11 - Trapezoid - Caramel\n12 - Pentagonal - Milk chocolate-cherry", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": "", "Status": true}
