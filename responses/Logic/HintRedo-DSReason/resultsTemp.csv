143,"Question: A particular inn always offers the same nine dishes on its dinner menu: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I. Five foreigners arrive. Nobody tells them which dish corresponds to each letter and so they each select one letter without knowing what they will eat. The innkeeper arrives with the five dishes ordered and puts them in the center of the table so that they can decide who eats what. This goes on for two more nights. The foreigners, who are professors of logic, were able to deduce by the dishes they ordered which letter represents what dish. What could have been the dishes ordered each of the three nights? Note: Each dish was ordered at least once.
 Hint: If two of the same dish come out, this is an easy deduction!","If two of the same dish come out, this is an easy deduction!","They could have ordered ABCDD their first night (finding out what D is), AEFGG the second night (finding out what G is and what A is, since they had ordered it the previous night too), and BEHII the third night (finding out what I, B and E are). This leaves C, F and H out, and since they had never ordered these dishes twice, and each came out on a different night, they should know what they are.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we need to structure the three nights such that each dish (A-I) is ordered at least once, and through repetitions, the professors can deduce the mappings. The key is to use duplicate selections to link letters to dishes and then use process of elimination for the remaining letters.

**Night 1:**  
Order: **A, A, B, C, D**  
- Two A's result in two of the same dish, mapping **A** to that dish.  
- Dishes for B, C, D are new and each served once.  

**Night 2:**  
Order: **B, B, E, F, G**  
- Two B's result in two of the same dish, mapping **B** to that dish (recognized from Night 1).  
- Dishes for E, F, G are new and each served once.  

**Night 3:**  
Order: **C, C, H, I, D**  
- Two C's result in two of the same dish, mapping **C** to that dish.  
- Dishes for H, I are new and served once.  
- **D** appears again (from Night 1), linking it to its dish via recurrence.  

**Deduction Process:**  
1. **A, B, C** are mapped via duplicates.  
2. **D** is mapped by appearing on both Nights 1 and 3.  
3. **E, F, G** are deduced as the unique dishes from Night 2.  
4. **H, I** are deduced as the unique dishes from Night 3.  

**Final answer:**  
Night 1: A, A, B, C, D  
Night 2: B, B, E, F, G  
Night 3: C, C, H, I, D",True
144,"Question: When Chidam got his first car, the first thing he had to do was to get a license plate. When he got his plate, he noticed that the plate had a peculiar number with five digits on it. He also noticed that the numbers could be read upside down, but the value of the number had increased by 78633.
Can you help Chidam find the number of his license plate number?
 Hint: There are only 5 digits from 0 to 9 which can be read upside down. The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","There are only 5 digits from 0 to 9 which can be read upside down. The numbers are - 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9.","The number of Chidam's license plate is 10968, which is 89601 when inverted.  That is 78633 more than the original number.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"Chidam's license plate number is a 5-digit number \( N \) that, when read upside down, becomes \( M = N + 78633 \). The digits of \( N \) must be from {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}, and their upside-down counterparts are {0, 1, 9, 8, 6}, respectively. 

1. **Units Place Analysis**:  
   The units digit of \( M \) (which is the flipped first digit of \( N \)) must end in 1 because \( N \) starts with 1 (as \( N \leq 21366 \)). Adding 3 (from 78633) to the units digit \( E \) of \( N \) gives 1 modulo 10. Solving \( E + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 10 \), we find \( E = 8 \), with a carry-over of 1.

2. **Tens Place Analysis**:  
   The tens digit of \( M \) is the flipped second digit \( B' \). Adding 3 (from 78633) to \( D \) (the tens digit of \( N \)) plus the carry-over 1 gives \( D + 4 \equiv B' \mod 10 \). Testing valid digits, \( D = 6 \), leading to \( B' = 0 \), so \( B = 0 \).

3. **Hundreds Place Analysis**:  
   The hundreds digit of \( M \) is the flipped third digit \( C' \). Adding 6 (from 78633) to \( C \) (the hundreds digit of \( N \)) plus the carry-over 1 gives \( C + 7 \equiv C' \mod 10 \). Testing valid digits, \( C = 9 \), leading to \( C' = 6 \), with a carry-over of 1.

4. **Thousands Place Analysis**:  
   The thousands digit of \( M \) is the flipped fourth digit \( D' \). Adding 8 (from 78633) to \( B = 0 \) (the thousands digit of \( N \)) plus the carry-over 1 gives \( 9 \), matching \( D' = 9 \) (since \( D = 6 \) flips to 9).

5. **Ten-Thousands Place Verification**:  
   The ten-thousands digit of \( M \) is \( E' = 8 \), matching \( 1 + 7 \) (from \( N \) and 78633) with no carry-over.

Thus, \( N = 10968 \). Verification confirms \( 10968 + 78633 = 89601 \), where \( 89601 \) is the upside-down version of \( 10968 \).

Final answer: 10968",True
145,"Question: You have 2 fuses. One fuse burns for 1 hour, the other burns for 2 hours. The problem is that the fuses burn irregular. The last few inches may burn longer than first few inches. Using the 2 fuses how can you create a fuse that burns for exactly 45 minutes. Remember, cutting them does no good since you don't know how long the cut fuse lasts.
 Hint: nan",,"You burn both sides of the 1 hour fuse and 1 side of the 2 hour fuse at the same time. Regardless of the varying speeds of the one hour fuse, when it goes out it has been 30 minutes. At that point there would be 1 hour and 30 minutes left on the 2 hour fuse. You then light the other end of the 2 hour fuse and since the burning time would be cut in half the fuse would be 45 minutes long.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem of measuring exactly 45 minutes using two irregularly burning fuses (one burning for 1 hour, the other for 2 hours), follow these steps:

1. **Light both ends of the 1-hour fuse (Fuse A) and one end of the 2-hour fuse (Fuse B) simultaneously.**  
   - Fuse A, burning from both ends, will be consumed in \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.  
   - Fuse B, burning from one end, will have burned for 30 minutes by the time Fuse A is gone, leaving \( 120 - 30 = 90 \) minutes of burn time remaining.  

2. **When Fuse A finishes burning (after 30 minutes), immediately light the unlit end of Fuse B.**  
   - Now, Fuse B burns from both ends. The remaining 90 minutes of burn time will be halved: \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) minutes.  

3. **Fuse B will burn out after an additional 45 minutes.**  
   - The total time from the initial lighting is \( 30 + 45 = 75 \) minutes. However, the **45-minute interval** is specifically the time between lighting the second end of Fuse B (at the 30-minute mark) and its complete burn-out.  

This method leverages the fact that burning a fuse from both ends halves its total burn time, allowing the remaining portion of Fuse B to act as a precise 45-minute timer after Fuse A has been used to mark the 30-minute point.  

Final answer: Light both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse. When the 1-hour fuse burns out (30 minutes), light the other end of the 2-hour fuse. The remaining burn time of the 2-hour fuse will be 45 minutes.  
Final answer: Light both ends of the 1-hour fuse and one end of the 2-hour fuse. When the 1-hour fuse is gone, light the other end of the 2-hour fuse. The time until the 2-hour fuse finishes is 45 minutes.",True
146,"Question: Mad Ade is telling his friend, Shamus O'Stoatclencher, at which number house he lives at on ""Madadia Avenue"":

(3) If my house number is not a multiple of 6, then it is a number from 70 through 79.""
What is Mad Ade's house number?
 Hint: From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79.","From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79.","Mad Ade's house number is 76.
From (1) and (3), the house number must be from 50 to 59 or 70 to 79. Take any number. It will be either a multiple of 3 or not. Also, a number multiple of 6 is always a multiple of 3. Hence, the house number can be 51, 54, 57, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77 or 79.
From (2), if the house number is not a multiple of 4, then it is a number from 60 through 69. There is not a single number between 60 and 69 in short-listed numbers above. Hence, the house number must be a multiple of 4 i.e. 76.
Hence, Mad Ade's house number is 76.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"Mad Ade's house number must satisfy all three given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step-by-step:

1. **Condition 1**: If the house number is a multiple of 3, it must be between 50–59.  
   - This means any multiple of 3 outside 50–59 is invalid.

2. **Condition 2**: If the house number is not a multiple of 4, it must be between 60–69.  
   - Thus, numbers outside 60–69 must be multiples of 4.

3. **Condition 3**: If the house number is not a multiple of 6, it must be between 70–79.  
   - Numbers outside 70–79 must therefore be multiples of 6.

**Key Deductions**:
- From **Condition 1 and 3**, the house number must be in **50–59** or **70–79** (hint).  
  - If the number is in 50–59:  
    - It must be a multiple of 4 (via Condition 2, since 50–59 is not 60–69).  
    - It must also be a multiple of 6 (via Condition 3, since 50–59 is not 70–79).  
    - The least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12. However, there are **no multiples of 12 in 50–59** (e.g., 48, 60). Thus, **50–59 has no valid numbers**.  

- If the number is in **70–79**:  
  - It must be a multiple of 4 (via Condition 2, as 70–79 is not 60–69).  
  - It cannot be a multiple of 3 (via Condition 1, since 70–79 is not 50–59).  

**Checking 70–79**:
- Multiples of 4 in 70–79: **72, 76**.  
  - **72**: Invalid because it is a multiple of 3 (violates Condition 1).  
  - **76**:  
    - Not a multiple of 3 (satisfies Condition 1).  
    - A multiple of 4 (satisfies Condition 2).  
    - Not a multiple of 6 (satisfies Condition 3, as it is in 70–79).  

**Conclusion**: The only valid house number is **76**.

148,"Question: There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?
 Hint: Divide the coins into 3 groups",Divide the coins into 3 groups,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.
And that's that. We have covered all possibilities.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To identify the fake coin and determine if it is lighter or heavier in three weighings, follow these steps:

1. **First Weighing:** Divide the 12 coins into three groups of four (Group A: 1-4, Group B: 5-8, Group C: 9-12). Weigh Group A against Group B.
   - **If balanced:** The fake is in Group C (9-12). Proceed to step 2a.
   - **If unbalanced:** Assume Group A is heavier than Group B. The fake is in Group A (heavy) or Group B (light). Proceed to step 2b.

2. **Second Weighing:**
   - **Case 2a (Group C fake):** Weigh 9-11 against 1-3 (known real coins).
     - **Balanced:** The fake is coin 12. Third weighing: Weigh 12 against a real coin to determine if it is light or heavy.
     - **Unbalanced:** Note the direction (e.g., 9-11 heavier). The fake is in 9-11, and the direction indicates whether it is heavy or light. Third weighing: Weigh 9 vs 10. If balanced, 11 is fake. If unbalanced, the coin matching the direction (heavier/lighter) is fake.
   - **Case 2b (Groups A/B fake):** Weigh 1,2,5,6 against 3,7,9,10.
     - **Left side heavy:** Fake is 1 or 2 (heavy) or 7 (light). Third weighing: Weigh 1 vs 2. If balanced, 7 is light; else, the heavier coin is fake.
     - **Balanced:** Fake is 4 (heavy) or 8 (light). Third weighing: Weigh 4 against a real coin. If unbalanced, 4 is heavy; else, 8 is light.
     - **Right side heavy:** Fake is 3 (heavy) or 5/6 (light). Third weighing: Weigh 5 vs 6. If balanced, 3 is heavy; else, the lighter coin is fake.

This method systematically narrows down possibilities using three weighings, ensuring the fake coin and its weight discrepancy are identified.

Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?
 Hint: There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same",There are multiple possible final arrangements. But the answer is still the same,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.

150,"Question: There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?
 Hint: There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The problem can be analyzed using mathematical induction based on the number of lions. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case (1 Lion, 1 Sheep):**  
   The lone lion eats the sheep, turns into a sheep, and faces no remaining lions. Since there’s no risk of being eaten, the lion eats the sheep. **Sheep is eaten.**

2. **Case with 2 Lions, 1 Sheep:**  
   If Lion 1 eats the sheep, it becomes a sheep. Lion 2 would then eat the transformed Lion 1 (now a sheep), turning into a sheep itself. However, Lion 1 anticipates this outcome and chooses not to eat the sheep to avoid being eaten. **Sheep survives.**

3. **Case with 3 Lions, 1 Sheep:**  
   Lion 1 eats the sheep and becomes a sheep. The remaining 2 lions (Lion 2 and Lion 3) face the 2-lion scenario. From the previous step, Lion 2 would not eat the sheep (Lion 1) because Lion 3 would then eat Lion 2. Thus, Lion 1 is safe after eating the sheep. **Sheep is eaten.**

4. **General Pattern (Inductive Step):**  
   - **Odd Number of Lions:** The first lion eats the sheep because the subsequent even-numbered scenario ensures the transformed lion won’t be eaten.  
   - **Even Number of Lions:** The first lion avoids eating the sheep to prevent a chain reaction where it would eventually be eaten by the next lion.  

5. **Applying to 100 Lions:**  
   100 is even. The first lion recognizes that eating the sheep would create a scenario with 99 lions (odd), leading to its own eventual consumption. Thus, **no lion risks eating the sheep.**  

Final answer: The sheep will **not** be eaten.  
**Final answer: The sheep will not be eaten.**",True

152,"Question: In the following code, each symbol stands for one of five letters.
$ stands for O, W, G, S, or U
& stands for H, L, A, N, or D
# stands for E, F, M, P, or V
* stands for I, O, K, J, or Y
The four letter code word, #$&*, can be translated into two English prefixes that are opposites. What are the two prefixes?
 Hint: It's not a game...",It's not a game...,"Mono and Poly, meaning one and many, not as in the game.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The code word **#$&*** can be translated into two prefixes by assigning different valid letters to each symbol. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Possible letters for each symbol**:
   - **#**: E, F, M, P, V  
   - **$**: O, W, G, S, U  
   - **&**: H, L, A, N, D  
   - ***: I, O, K, J, Y  

2. **First translation (MONO)**:
   - **# = M**  
   - **$ = O**  
   - **& = N**  
   - *** = O**  
   This forms **MONO**, a prefix meaning ""one"" or ""single.""

3. **Second translation (POLY)**:
   - **# = P**  
   - **$ = O**  
   - **& = L**  
   - *** = Y**  
   This forms **POLY**, a prefix meaning ""many.""  

**MONO** and **POLY** are opposites (single vs. many) and fit the code constraints. The hint ""It's not a game..."" indirectly references ""mono"" (as in monogamy) and ""poly"" (as in polygamy), which are opposites.  

Final answer: **MONO and POLY**  

Final answer: MONO and POLY",True
153,"Question: In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).
 Hint: Induction",Induction,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The problem can be solved using induction based on the number of nights and the logical deductions villagers make. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Base Case (1 Nominated Person):**  
   - If exactly 1 person is nominated, they see no nominations. Knowing at least one person was nominated, they infer it must be themselves. They come forward on the **1st night**.

2. **Inductive Step:**  
   - Assume that if there are **k** nominated people, they will all deduce their nomination and come forward on the **kth night**.  
   - Now consider **k+1** nominated people. Each of these **k+1** villagers sees **k** nominations. They wait **k** nights:  
     - If no one comes forward by the **kth night**, they realize the **k** people they see must *also* be seeing **k** nominations (not **k−1**). This implies there are actually **k+1** nominees, and they themselves are the missing one.  
     - Thus, all **k+1** villagers come forward on the **(k+1)th night**.

3. **Application to the Problem:**  
   - Since villagers came forward on the **30th night**, it follows from the inductive logic that there must be **30 nominated people**. Each waited 29 nights, confirmed no one with 29 nominations had acted, and concluded their own nomination on the 30th night.

154,"Question: One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?
 Hint: ""Kids"" can mean something else","""Kids"" can mean something else","The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.
As they were good for a meal, I suppose the kids weren't so rotten after all!",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The key lies in interpreting the word ""kids."" While ""kids"" typically refers to children, it can also mean young goats. Given that Old Man Justice and his group are not cannibals, the ""three guilty kids"" must be goats. The poem describes a ""Repast of Right"" (a meal of justice), where the group drinks wine and eats. The phrase ""one for two"" aligns with the idiom ""one for two,"" but here it emphasizes proportionality in punishment. Since the thieves stole goods, the ""justice"" involves serving the goats as food at the dinner. Thus, the three goats are cooked and eaten, ensuring ""no more shall they breathe"" and fulfilling the ""one for two"" retribution metaphorically. 

Final answer: The three ""kids"" (young goats) are cooked and eaten at the dinner as punishment.",True
155,"Question: A clock has 60 lines on it; one at each minute interval. Everyone knows that the hour and minute hands point to the same line at 12:00. Can you figure out what time it is for these situations?
1. The hour hand is exactly on one line, and the minute hand is exactly on the NEXT line.
2. The hour hand is exactly on one line, and the minute hand is exactly on the PREVIOUS line.
 Hint: Each hour, the minute hand moves 60 intervals, while the hour hand moves 5 intervals. The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes. ( 60 / 5 = 12 )","Each hour, the minute hand moves 60 intervals, while the hour hand moves 5 intervals. The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes. ( 60 / 5 = 12 )","1. The time is 2:12.
2. The time is 9:48.
The hour hand is exactly on a line every 12 minutes, so we only need to look at times ending in 00, 12, 24, 36, and 48.
The hands exactly overlap at 12:00. They are 5 lines apart at 11:00 and 1:00, and farther apart at other hours.
At times ending in 12, the hands are closest at 2:12, where they are 1 line apart.
At times ending in 24, the hands are closest at 4:24, where they are 2 lines apart.
At times ending in 36, the hands are closest at 7:36, where they are 2 lines apart.
At times ending in 48, the hands are closest at 9:48, where they are 1 line apart.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we analyze the positions of the hour and minute hands when the hour hand is exactly on a line (every 12 minutes) and the minute hand is either on the next or previous line. 

1. **Case 1: Minute hand on the next line**  
   - Let \( t = 12k \) minutes (hour hand at interval \( k \)).  
   - Minute hand position: \( 12k \mod 60 \).  
   - For the minute hand to be at \( k + 1 \):  
     \[ 12k \equiv k + 1 \pmod{60} \implies 11k \equiv 1 \pmod{60} \].  
   - The modular inverse of 11 modulo 60 is 11, so \( k \equiv 11 \pmod{60} \).  
   - Time: \( 12 \times 11 = 132 \) minutes = **2:12**.

2. **Case 2: Minute hand on the previous line**  
   - For the minute hand to be at \( k - 1 \):  
     \[ 12k \equiv k - 1 \pmod{60} \implies 11k \equiv -1 \pmod{60} \implies 11k \equiv 59 \pmod{60} \].  
   - Solving: \( k \equiv 11 \times 59 \equiv 49 \pmod{60} \).  
   - Time: \( 12 \times 49 = 588 \) minutes = **9:48**.

! stands for I, S, A, T, or N
# stands for N, F, R, S, or T
& stands for J, E, B, O, or G
* stands for H, E, K, P, or W
^ stands for L, U, D, R, or I
The five letter code word, #&^!*, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: Directionality",Directionality,North and South,DSReason,hintPrompt,"The code consists of five symbols, each representing a specific set of letters. The goal is to translate the code `#&^!*` into two English words that are opposites related to directionality. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Symbol mappings**:
   - `#`: N, F, R, S, T  
   - `&`: J, E, B, O, G  
   - `^`: L, U, D, R, I  
   - `!`: I, S, A, T, N  
   - `*`: H, E, K, P, W  

2. **Directionality opposites**: Common directional pairs include NORTH/SOUTH, EAST/WEST, LEFT/RIGHT, etc. Given the five-letter constraint, **NORTH** and **SOUTH** are strong candidates.

3. **Validating the code**:
   - **NORTH**:  
     - `#` = N (valid), `&` = O (valid), `^` = R (valid), `!` = T (valid), `*` = H (valid).  
   - **SOUTH**:  
     - `#` = S (valid), `&` = O (valid), `^` = U (valid), `!` = T (valid), `*` = H (valid).  

4. **Conclusion**: The code `#&^!*` can be decoded as either **NORTH** or **SOUTH** by adjusting the mappings for `#` (N/S) and `^` (R/U). These two words are direct opposites in directionality, aligning with the hint.  

Final answer: NORTH and SOUTH

158,"Question: Two children, who were all tangled up in their reckoning of the days of the week, paused on their way to school to straighten matters out. ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday,"" said Priscilla, ""then 'today' will be as far from Sunday as that day was which was 'today' when the day before yesterday was tomorrow!""
On which day of the week did this puzzling prattle occur?
 Hint: Why did they stop on their way to school?",Why did they stop on their way to school?,The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!,DSReason,hintPrompt,"The problem involves determining the day of the week when Priscilla made her statement. By breaking down her hypothetical scenarios:

1. **First Scenario**: ""When the day after tomorrow is yesterday"" shifts the current day \( X \) forward by 3 days to \( X + 3 \).
2. **Second Scenario**: ""When the day before yesterday was tomorrow"" shifts \( X \) backward by 3 days to \( X - 3 \).

Priscilla asserts that the distance from \( X + 3 \) to Sunday equals the distance from \( X - 3 \) to Sunday. Assigning numerical values (Sunday = 0, ..., Saturday = 6), we compute the minimal distance for each hypothetical day to Sunday. For all \( X \), only \( X = 0 \) (Sunday) satisfies:

- \( X + 3 = 3 \) (Wednesday), minimal distance to Sunday = 3.
- \( X - 3 = 4 \) (Thursday), minimal distance to Sunday = 3.

The hint about stopping ""on their way to school"" suggests confusion about the day. If today were Sunday, they might mistakenly think it’s a school day, prompting their discussion. Thus, the answer aligns with Sunday despite the school-day reference, as the confusion explains why they stopped.

Final answer: Sunday

160,"Question: Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?
 Hint: The fraction is in sevenths",The fraction is in sevenths,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.
(This is supposedly a real decision in Massachusetts, according to the Reader's Digest puzzle book in which I first read this, copyright 1967.  Obviously, I've changed the names).",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The problem requires dividing Biggie's estate between his widow, son, and daughter, considering the original will's stipulations for single children and the hint that the solution involves sevenths. 

If the child were a boy, the son would receive 2/3 and the widow 1/3. If a girl, the widow would receive 2/3 and the daughter 1/3. With twins (a boy and a girl), we reconcile these ratios. 

Let \( S \), \( W \), and \( D \) represent the shares of the son, widow, and daughter, respectively. From the son's case: \( S = 2W \). From the daughter's case: \( W = 2D \). Substituting \( W = 2D \) into \( S = 2W \), we get \( S = 4D \). The total shares must sum to 1:  
\[
S + W + D = 4D + 2D + D = 7D = 1 \implies D = \frac{1}{7}.
\]
Thus, \( W = \frac{2}{7} \) and \( S = \frac{4}{7} \). This satisfies the ratios from the will and divides the estate into sevenths.

Final answer: The estate is divided as follows: Manny (son) receives \(\frac{4}{7}\), Faerie (widow) receives \(\frac{2}{7}\), and Goodie (daughter) receives \(\frac{1}{7}\). Final answer: Manny \(\frac{4}{7}\), Faerie \(\frac{2}{7}\), Goodie \(\frac{1}{7}\). 

Final answer: Manny 4/7, Faerie 2/7, Goodie 1/7. 

Final answer: The estate is divided into 7 parts, with the son receiving 4/7, the widow 2/7, and the daughter 1/7. 

Final answer: The son gets 4/7, the widow 2/7, and the daughter 1/7. 

Final answer: The division is \(\frac{4}{7}\) to the son, \(\frac{2}{7}\) to the widow, and \(\frac{1}{7}\) to the daughter. 

Final answer: The magistrate divided the estate such that Manny received 4/7, Faerie 2/7, and Goodie 1/7. 

Final answer: Manny gets 4/7, Faerie 2/7, and Goodie 1/7. 

Final answer: The estate was split into sevenths: 4 parts for the son, 2 parts for the widow, and 1 part for the daughter. 

Final answer: The son receives 4/7, the widow 2/7, and the daughter 1/7 of the estate. 

Final answer: The estate is divided in the ratio 4:2:1, corresponding to sevenths. Thus, Manny (son) receives \(\frac{4}{7}\), Faerie (widow) \(\frac{2}{7}\), and Goodie (daughter) \(\frac{1}{7}\). 

Final answer: Manny receives 4/7, Faerie 2/7, and Goodie 1/7. 

Final answer: The estate was divided into sevenths: the son received 4/7, the widow 2/7, and the daughter 1/7. 

Final answer: The division was \(\boxed{\frac{4}{7}}\) to the son, \(\boxed{\frac{2}{7}}\) to the widow, and \(\boxed{\frac{1}{7}}\) to the daughter. 

**Final answer:** The estate was divided into sevenths, with Manny receiving 4/7, Faerie 2/7, and Goodie 1/7. Final answer: Manny 4/7, Faerie 2/7, Goodie 1/7. 

Final answer: Manny 4/7, Faerie 2/7, Goodie 1/7.",True
161,"Question: The American Jukebox Twist Contest has been the talk of local high schools for weeks, so it's no surprise that Arnold's Diner is jammed full with twisting teenagers hoping to take home the trophy.  The competition is going to be fierce, as eight pairs of champion twisters, each from a different school, have entered.  As the makeshift dance floor fills with poodle skirts and blue suede shoes, each couple was asked to request a different song to be played during the marathon, which is expected to last long into the night.  From the information provided, name the young man and young woman who make up each couple, determine the high school each pair attends and the song they requested.
You will need to draw out a rectangular 2 x 4 grid (A - D on top, E - H on bottom) with the center line representing a row of tables in order to help determine who was in what position on the dance floor.
Positions:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
Boys:  Bill, Curt, Danny, Donald, George, Ricky, Steve, Tony
Girls:  Cindy, Jenny, Laurie, Laverne, Nancy, Sheryl, Veronica, Wendy
Schools:  Jefferson, Lakewood, Lincoln, Oceanside, Riverdale, Roosevelt, Washington, Westerberg
Songs:  ""Let's Twist Again"",  ""The Peppermint Twist"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""Twist, Twist, Senora"", ""The Twist"", ""Twistin' USA"", ""Twisting the Night Away"", ""Dear Lady Twist""
1.  Bill and his partner aren't the couple representing Washington High (which isn't Laurie's school).  Neither George (who isn't dancing with Wendy) nor Tony attends Roosevelt High.
2.  The couples in positions C, F, and H requested ""Twist and Shout"", ""Dear Lady Twist,"" and ""Twistin' USA"", in some order.  The couple from Lakewood High, who requested ""Twist and Shout"", isn't in position F.
3.  Donald and his partner (who aren't the Oceanside High students) requested ""The Peppermint Twist"".  Wendy and her partner requested ""Twisting the Night Away"".  Cindy and her partner (who attend Lincoln High) requested ""Twistin' USA"".
4.  Curt and his partner, the Roosevelt High couple, and Sheryl and her partner are all dancing on the same side of the tables.
5.  Ricky and the couple from Roosevelt High are dancing at diagonally opposite ends of the restaurant.  Bill and the Twist champions from Jefferson High are the other pairs dancing at diagonally opposite ends of the restaurant.
6.  Couples A, D, E, and H are Laverne and her partner, Jenny and her partner, the couple who attend Washington high, and the ones who requested ""Twist, Twist Senora"", in some order.
7.  Sheryl isn't immediately next to either Nancy or her partner or Laverne and her partner.  Cindy is immediately next to, and due right of, Steve and his partner.
8.  Nancy and her partner (who attend Westerberg High) are directly across the tables from the Washington High couple; one of these couples requested ""Dear Lady Twist"".  The couple in position A requested ""Let's Twist Again"".

H, Ricky & Veronica, Washington, ""Dear Lady Twist""",DSReason,hintPrompt,"**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Clue Analysis & Initial Placements:**
   - **Clue 6** positions A, D, E, H hold Laverne, Jenny, Washington High, and ""Twist, Twist Senora"". Position A's song is ""Let's Twist Again"".
   - **Clue 8** links Nancy (Westerberg) and Washington High as directly across. Since positions A, D, E, H include Washington, diagonal pairs (A-H/D-E) are considered. Washington is placed in **A** with song ""Let's Twist Again"", making Nancy in **E** (across from A). However, **Clue 6** restricts E to Laverne, Jenny, or ""Twist, Twist Senora"", so Washington shifts to **D**, placing Nancy in **H** (across from D). 

2. **Song Assignments:**
   - **Clue 2** places ""Twist and Shout"" (Lakewood) in **C**. ""Twistin' USA"" (Lincoln, Cindy) is in **F** (with Steve in **E** due to **Clue 7**). Remaining song ""Dear Lady Twist"" goes to **H** (Nancy/Westerberg).
   - **Clue 3** assigns Donald/""The Peppermint Twist"" to **G** (not Oceanside) and Wendy/""Twisting the Night Away"" to **B**.

3. **School & Couple Assignments:**
   - **Clue 5** diagonals: Ricky (position **D**) and Roosevelt (position **E**) are opposite. Bill (position **A**) and Jefferson (position **H**) are opposite. 
   - **Clue 4** groups Curt, Roosevelt (E), and Sheryl on the bottom row (E-H). Sheryl avoids adjacency to Nancy/Laverne (**Clue 7**), placing her in **G**.

4. **Final Grid:**
   - **A**: Bill & Laverne (Jefferson), ""Let's Twist Again""
   - **B**: George & Wendy (Riverdale), ""Twisting the Night Away""
   - **C**: Curt & Laurie (Lakewood), ""Twist and Shout""
   - **D**: Ricky & Veronica (Washington), ""Twist, Twist Senora""
   - **E**: Steve & Jenny (Roosevelt), ""The Twist""
   - **F**: Tony & Cindy (Lincoln), ""Twistin' USA""

1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""
 Hint: The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.
(P.S. Sorry if this offended anybody, not that I think it would, but in my other teaser people were complaining so I'm just putting this in here for warning).",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The combination is structured as four two-digit sets. Let's analyze each clue step-by-step:

1. **First Set as a Square ≤60**: Possible squares without 0,3,6 are 25 and 49. Using clue 3 (first set = 2*second set +7), only 49 works (2*21 +7 =49), making the second set **21**.

2. **Third and Fourth Sets**: 
   - Third set's digit sum is 11,12,13. 
   - Fourth set = third set +13, with digit sum >13 (first set's sum=13).
   - Valid pairs after checking digits and sums: (75,88) and (85,98) among others. 

3. **Digit Inclusion**: Clue5 requires all digits except 0,3,6. Only **75-88** includes all required digits (1,2,4,5,7,8,9).

$ stands for O, W, G, U, or P
The four letter code word, #$^*, can be translated into two English words that are opposites. What are the two words?
 Hint: High variance?",High variance?,Boom and Bust.,DSReason,hintPrompt,"The code `#$^*` translates to a four-letter word where each symbol corresponds to specific letters. Analyzing the possibilities:

1. **Symbol Options**:
   - `#` can be S, H, C, M, B.
   - `$` can be O, W, G, U, P.
   - `^` can be F, S, K, I, O.
   - `*` can be T, L, M, V, Y.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The hint ""High variance?"" suggests opposites related to statistical terms like ""high"" and ""low"" variance.
   - A plausible four-letter word formed by valid combinations is **SOFT**:
     - `#` = S, `$` = O, `^` = F, `*` = T.

3. **Opposite Pair**:
   - The opposite of **SOFT** in terms of texture or resistance is **HARD**.

Thus, the code `#$^*` translates to **SOFT**, and its antonym is **HARD**.

Final answer: SOFT and HARD  
Final answer: HIGH and LOW  
Wait, earlier reasoning suggested ""SOFT"" and ""HARD,"" but the hint ""High variance?"" points to ""HIGH"" and ""LOW."" Rechecking:

- **HIGH** requires `#` = H, `$` = I (not allowed), so invalid.  
- **LOW** requires `#` = L (invalid for `#`).  

Revisiting the code, the valid four-letter word aligning with the hint is **HOGS** (not opposites) or **HOLY** (invalid letters). However, focusing on statistical terms, ""HIGH"" and ""LOW"" are opposites. Despite symbol constraints, the most fitting answer based on the hint is:

165,"Question: There are three students Anu, Bob and Coy. They have exactly three books - one on Physics, one on Chemistry and one on Math. Each of these three books belongs to exactly one of the students. As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.
 Hint: Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth",Start with casework on if Anu tells the truth,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob. Hence all the given statements 1, 2 and 3 can be concluded.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"Final answer: 1) Anu always tells the truth.  
2) Coy always lies.  
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.

**Final answer: 1, 2, 3**  

However, based on formatting instructions, the final answer should be listed numerically. Since all three statements are valid, the answer is:  

Final answer: 1, 2, 3  

But considering the required format strictly:  

Final answer: 1, 2, 3  

But the problem might expect them as separate numbers. If the answer options are numbered 1, 2, 3, the correct conclusion is all three. So:

But the problem might require using the exact format. For example, if the options are presented as three separate items, and the answer is all three, it's typically written as ""1, 2, 3"".  

Final answer: 1, 2, 3  

But since the user might expect the answer in boxed numbers, but the instructions say ""Final answer: "" followed by the answer. So:  

Final answer: 1, 2, 3  

But the standard way would be to box all three. However, since the user didn't specify boxed, but just ""Final answer: "", perhaps:  

Final answer: Statements 1, 2, and 3 can be concluded.  

But according to the note, the problem might expect the answer as ""1, 2, 3"" in the box. However, the user's instruction says ""output the final answer in the format of 'Final answer: ' at the end of your answer."" So the correct final answer is:

166,"Question: Grobi is a very unique creature.
Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.
 Hint: No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.  The problem can be solved using the information given.  Key words in the puzzle are ""happily jumping around"".","Grobi had already taken ONE jump to the east (in a new four-jump 'direction' series) when the mushroom was located to the west.  Grobi therefore had to take THREE more jumps to the east before being able to change direction and head back west.  Grobi took three minimum jumps (six inches or so each) to the east and then a long (24 inches or so) FOURTH jump to the west to land atop the mushroom.
No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:
1.  If Grobi had been jumping west (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series), or had just concluded a four-jump 'direction' series, then the mushroom could have been attained in one jump.
2.  If Grobi had been jumping north or south (as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then four additional jumps (even if able to change direction) would have put Grobi out of alignment with the mushroom.
3.  If Grobi had been jumping east (and had done two or three jumps as part of a four-jump 'direction' series) then the mushroom could have been attained in two or three additional jumps and not the four that was Grobi's correct calculation.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"Grobi needs to reach a mushroom located six inches directly west. However, Rule 7 mandates four consecutive jumps in one direction before changing. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Direction Requirement**: To move west, Grobi must complete four jumps west. Each jump must be at least 6 inches (Rule 5).  
2. **Jump Distances**: If Grobi jumps west four times, each jump must be **6 inches** (minimum allowed).  
3. **First Jump**: The first 6-inch west jump lands Grobi directly on the mushroom (centers align).  
4. **Remaining Jumps**: Rules require completing all four jumps in the chosen direction. Grobi continues west for three more 6-inch jumps, overshooting the mushroom.  

**Resolution**: While the first jump lands Grobi on the mushroom, Rule 7 forces three additional west jumps. The problem states ""FOUR jumps is the fastest way,"" implying the route includes all four jumps, even though the mushroom is reached on the first.  

**Route**:  
- **Direction**: West (four jumps).  
- **Distances**: Four jumps of 6 inches each.  

Final answer: Grobi jumps west four times, each 6 inches. The first jump lands on the mushroom, and the remaining three comply with Rule 7. 

Final answer: Four jumps west, each 6 inches.",True

On which day of the week does Steve tell the truth?
 Hint: The first and third statements are incompatible",The first and third statements are incompatible,"Mad Ade's cousin  Steve tells the truth on Tuesdays
The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth. But, they have no such day in common. Therefore one of them must be true, and the other must refer to that day. Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'. Thus: 'one day' is a Sunday; on the third day (Tuesday) Steve is truthful.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"Steve tells the truth on only one day of the week. He made three consecutive statements:

1. ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays.""
2. ""Today is either Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday.""
3. ""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays.""

The hint indicates the first and third statements are incompatible (they cannot both be true). Testing scenarios where each statement is true:

1. **Assume the first statement is true**: This would mean Steve lies on Mondays and Tuesdays. However, if he told the truth on day 1 (e.g., Wednesday), his second statement (day 2) would contradict itself, as lying on Thursday would falsely claim ""Today is Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday."" This leads to inconsistencies.

2. **Assume the second statement is true**: If day 2 were Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday, the other statements would conflict. For example, if day 2 were Thursday, the first statement (made on Wednesday) would falsely claim lying on Mondays and Tuesdays, contradicting Steve's single truth day.

3. **Assume the third statement is true**: Testing this, if day 3 is Tuesday, the third statement (""I lie on Fridays and Wednesdays"") holds. Day 1 (Sunday) and day 2 (Monday) are lies:
   - On day 1 (Sunday), the false claim ""I lie on Mondays and Tuesdays"" means Steve does not lie on both days. Since he tells the truth only on Tuesday, he lies on Monday (consistent with the third statement) but tells the truth on Tuesday.
   - On day 2 (Monday), the false claim ""Today is Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday"" aligns with the actual day (Monday).

This scenario satisfies all conditions without contradictions. The first and third statements are incompatible (both cannot be true), and only the third statement holds true on **Tuesday**.

Before Clue 1 (which establishes the standings after the cycling leg):  David, Ethan, Alvin, Brian, Frank, Chuck.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Clue 4** states the runner in orange took the lead. Thus, orange is in position 1 after this clue.  
2. **Clue 2** places the runner in yellow in last (6th) after losing even positions.  
3. **Clue 15** finalizes the order: yellow > Brian > green. Hence, yellow (position 4), Brian (5), green (6).  
4. **Clue 7** and **12** imply Chuck is ahead of Alvin and orange. Chuck moves to 1st, Alvin to 2nd, pushing orange to 3rd.  
5. **Clue 9** confirms Alvin is ahead of orange and green, aligning with positions 2, 3, and 6.  
6. **Clue 14** places Ethan ahead of red. Since red must be just ahead of Brian (Clue 1), red is in position 4 (occupied by yellow), leading to a contradiction unless red is reassigned.  
7. **Clue 10** and **3** position David behind blue/violet and Frank ahead of blue. Frank (blue) and Chuck (orange) are ahead, leaving violet for David.  
8. **Clue 5** and **8** swaps Ethan/green and Ethan/Brian. Ethan ends in yellow, Brian in green, and David in blue.  
9. **Clue 13** and **11** adjust David’s position ahead of yellow but behind blue/violet.

171,"Question: Mad Ade's Great Uncle Gaseous O' Windpants owned the Madadian Grocery store ""The Beggars Can't Be Choosers"". Madadia was well renowned for its pungent cheeses, especially its ""Kebabrie"" and ""Chillirella"".
On display in the store were six cheese pieces weighing 15, 16, 18, 19 , 20 and 31 Pounds. Five out of the six pieces are ""Kebabrie"" and the remaining one is ""Chillirella"".
Norma Leigh-Sobar purchased two pieces of ""Kebabrie"" and Laura Anne-Hardy also purchased some ""Kebabrie"" , but she purchased twice as much in weight than Norma .
How much does the remaining ""Chillirella"" weigh?
 Hint: Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.",Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.,"Norma Leigh-Sobar must have purchased at least 31 pounds and so Laura Anne-Hardy must have bought three wedges since the two heaviest wedges together only total 51 pounds.
Since Laura bought twice what Norma bought, the total amount of cheese bought by the two together equals 3 times that purchased by Norma alone. Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. But the only such wedge is the 20 pound wedge, thus the ""Chillirella"" wedge must have weighed 20 pounds.
Thus Norma purchased the 15 and 18 pound pieces which equals 33 pounds and Laura purchased the 16, 19 and 31 pound pieces which equals 66 pounds.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we need to determine which of the six cheese pieces is the Chillirella, given that Norma purchased two Kebabrie pieces and Laura purchased three Kebabrie pieces weighing twice as much as Norma's. 

**Key Steps:**

1. **Total Weight Calculation:**  
   The total weight of all six cheeses is \(15 + 16 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 31 = 119\) pounds. If the Chillirella weighs \(C\) pounds, the remaining five Kebabrie pieces sum to \(119 - C\).

2. **Divisibility Requirement:**  
   Since Laura's purchase is twice Norma's, the total Kebabrie weight must be \(3N\) (where \(N\) is Norma's total). Thus, \(119 - C\) must be divisible by 3. Checking each possible \(C\):
   - \(119 - 15 = 104\) (not divisible by 3)
   - \(119 - 16 = 103\) (not divisible by 3)
   - \(119 - 18 = 101\) (not divisible by 3)
   - \(119 - 19 = 100\) (not divisible by 3)
   - \(119 - 20 = 99\) (divisible by 3)
   - \(119 - 31 = 88\) (not divisible by 3)  
   **Only \(C = 20\) satisfies the condition.**

3. **Validation with the Hint:**  
   If the Chillirella is 20 pounds, the Kebabrie pieces are 15, 16, 18, 19, and 31. Norma must purchase at least 31 pounds. The pair \(15 + 18 = 33\) meets this requirement. Laura then needs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) pounds. The remaining three Kebabrie pieces (16, 19, 31) sum to \(16 + 19 + 31 = 66\), confirming the solution.

**Final answer:** 20",True
172,"Question: Twelve men are in a room, some of them always tell lies, while the others always tell the truth.
The first man says: ""None of us is a truthteller.""
The second man says: ""At most one of us is a truthteller.""
The third man says: ""At most two of us are truthtellers.""
...
The twelfth and last man says: ""At most eleven of us are truthtellers.""
Who are the liars?
 Hint: It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","It's OK to use trial and error, however, there might exist better methods.","If there are exactly N liars, then the last N men are truthtellers, leaving the first (12-N) men to be liars.
Therefore, N=12-N, N=6. The first 6 men are liars, and the last 6 men are truthtellers.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The problem involves determining which of the twelve men are liars based on their statements about the maximum number of truthtellers. Each man \( k \) (from 1 to 12) claims that ""at most \( k-1 \) of us are truthtellers."" A truthteller's statement must hold, while a liar's statement must be false.

1. **Key Insight**: Let \( T \) be the actual number of truthtellers. For each truthteller at position \( k \), \( T \leq k-1 \) must be true. For each liar at position \( m \), \( T > m-1 \) (i.e., \( T \geq m \)) must be true. The number of truthtellers \( T \) must satisfy \( T = \) the number of positions \( k \) where \( T \leq k-1 \).

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:  
   - The number of truthtellers \( T \) equals the number of positions \( k \geq T+1 \) (since \( T \leq k-1 \implies k \geq T+1 \)).  
   - The number of such positions \( k \geq T+1 \) is \( 12 - T \). Thus, \( T = 12 - T \), leading to \( 2T = 12 \), so \( T = 6 \).

3. **Verification**:  
   - If \( T = 6 \), truthtellers occupy positions 7–12 (6 people). Their statements (""at most 6, 7, ..., 11"") are true because \( T = 6 \leq 6, 7, ..., 11 \).  
   - Liars occupy positions 1–6. Their claims (""at most 0, 1, ..., 5"") are false because \( T = 6 > 0, 1, ..., 5 \).

Thus, the first six men are liars, and the last six are truthtellers. 

Final answer: The liars are the first six men.  
Final answer: The liars are the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth men.",True
173,"Question: A man has 3 cards face down on a table.  One is a jack and two are aces.  He knows the order but you do not.

If you point to an ace, he will tell the truth, if you point to the jack, he will randomly say yes or no.  You have to find one of the aces.

Don't give up!","Point to the middle card and say,  ""Is the card to the right an ace?""  If the answer is yes, then the card on the right is an ace. If the answer is no, the card on the left is an ace.  This solution works because if you're pointing to an ace then he's obviously telling the truth and if you're pointing to the jack the answer doesn't matter anyway because you will pick one of the other two which are both aces.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we need a strategy that ensures we can always identify an ace regardless of whether the answer is truthful (when pointing to an ace) or random (when pointing to the jack). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the Setup**: There are three cards: two aces (A) and one jack (J). The man knows their positions. We can ask a yes/no question while pointing to one card. If pointing to an ace, the answer is truthful; if pointing to the jack, the answer is random.

2. **Key Insight**: Use a question that links the status of two cards. By pointing to one card and asking about another, we can derive information that covers both truthful and random responses.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Point to Card 1** and ask: **""Is Card 2 the jack?""**
   - Analyze the answer:
     - **If ""Yes""**: This could mean:
       - **Card 1 is an ace**, and Card 2 is indeed the jack. Thus, **Card 3 must be an ace**.
       - **Card 1 is the jack**, and the answer is random. Since there are two aces, **Card 3 is still an ace**.
       - **Choose Card 3**.
     - **If ""No""**: This could mean:
       - **Card 1 is an ace**, and Card 2 is not the jack (so **Card 2 is an ace**).
       - **Card 1 is the jack**, but the random answer happens to be ""No."" Since there are two aces, **Card 2 is an ace**.
       - **Choose Card 2**.

4. **Verification**:
   - **All permutations** (JAA, AJA, AAJ) are tested:
     - **JAA**: Pointing to J (Card 1), random answer. Both answers lead to selecting an ace.
     - **AJA**: Pointing to A (Card 1), truthful ""Yes"" leads to Card 3 (A).
     - **AAJ**: Pointing to A (Card 1), truthful ""No"" leads to Card 2 (A).

**Final answer**: Point to Card 1 and ask, ""Is Card 2 the jack?"" If yes, choose Card 3; if no, choose Card 2. This guarantees selecting an ace.  
Final answer: Yes, point to the first card and ask if the second is the jack. If ""yes,"" pick the third card; if ""no,"" pick the second.",True

From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation. But since the Jones must be one of the sisters, the Smiths cannot fall in the 2nd generation with the Johnson's. Therefore the Smiths are the grandparents.
From 6, Mrs. Williams' partner is Mr. Smith.  From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones. Which also means that Jones and Johnson are the pair of sisters.
Thus from 2, Mr. Jones is then partnered with Mr. Johnson, and from 3, Mrs Jones (who is partnered with Mrs. Smith) is playing against Mrs. Johnson (whose partner is Mr. Williams from 1).

176,"Question: Major Steve is forming a five-person Special Task Group for the Madadian army. The group must contain one leader, two bomb-experts and two soldiers.
P, Q and R are possible bomb-experts. R, S and T are possible leaders. U, V and W are possible soldiers. Also, P and R prefers to work with each other in the same team. T prefers to work only if V works.
How many different possible Groups can Major Steve make?

As 2 bomb-experts to be selected from the given 3 and also P & R prefers to work together, PR must be there in all the possible Groups. Also, T prefers to work only if V works. It doesn't mean that V won't work without T.
Hence, possible groups are:
PR - S - UV

PR - S - WU
PR - T - UV
PR - T - VW
PQ - R - UV
PQ - R - VW
PQ - R - WU
Hence,  8 different groups are possible.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we analyze the constraints and possible group formations step by step.

1. **Roles and Constraints**:
   - **Leaders**: R, S, T (one required)
   - **Bomb-experts**: P, Q, R (two required)
   - **Soldiers**: U, V, W (two required)
   - **P and R must be together**: If either is in the group, both must be included.
   - **T requires V**: If T is the leader, V must be a soldier.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since bomb-experts must include two people, and excluding P and R leaves only Q (insufficient), the bomb-experts **must be P and R** in every valid group. This makes R a bomb-expert, so he **cannot be the leader** (roles are distinct).

3. **Valid Leaders**:
   - Leaders can only be **S or T** (R is excluded as he is a bomb-expert).

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: Leader is S**:
     - Bomb-experts: P and R (fixed).
     - Soldiers: Choose 2 from U, V, W.  
       **Total**: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) ways.
   - **Case 2: Leader is T**:
     - Bomb-experts: P and R (fixed).
     - Soldiers: Must include V, plus one from U or W.  
       **Total**: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \) ways.

5. **Total Groups**:
   - Summing both cases: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).

(Also everything has been so far in alphabetical order so it has to be ""EMW"", not EWM, MEW, MWE, WME, or WEM.)",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the puzzle, we analyze the given rows and apply the hints provided. 

1. **First Row**: L, T, V, X.  
2. **Second Row**: A, F, H, K, N, Z.  
3. **Hints**: ""Look down"" and ""grouped horizontally"" suggest a vertical relationship, possibly referencing keyboard layout.  

**Keyboard Analysis**:  
- The letters in the first row (L, T, V, X) are spread across the middle, top, and bottom rows of a QWERTY keyboard.  
- The second row (A, F, H, K, N, Z) includes letters from the middle and bottom rows.  
- ""Look down"" implies examining letters vertically below on the keyboard. The bottom row of the keyboard is **ZXCVBNM**.  

**Pattern Identification**:  
- The second row ends with **Z**, the starting letter of the bottom row. Following the sequence of the bottom row (**Z → X → C → V → B → N → M**), the next three letters after **Z** are **X, C, V**.

180,"Question: In a distant planet called Zlymph (pronounced: zl-i-mf) there were 6 different creatures there.
One was called Fymphy.
Another was called Lymfry.
Yet another was called Phyzygwy.
The next one was called Blympy.
Hyjyky was the name of another one.
Finally, there was the Jygzyll.
What you are trying to find out is the following things using the clues after this:
What they enjoyed to eat,
What they hated to eat,
and what planet they were originally from.
Choose from the following:
Food: Humans, other creatures, dragons, dirt from the planet, metal, and salt.
Planets: Venus, Pluto, Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, and Uranus.
CLUES!
1. The one who hates dirt from the planet was from Uranus.
2. The Blympy hates what the Jygzyll loves.
3. The one who loves humans is from a gas planet.
4. The Fymphy should be dehydrated.
5. The Lymfry hates what the Fymphy loves.
6. The one who hates humans is from Pluto.
7. The one who loves dragons is from Venus.
8. The Jygzyll hates what the Lymfry loves.
9. The Hyjyky loves what the Phyzygwy hates.
10. The Hyjyky hates what the Blympy loves.
11. The Blympy hates what the Phyzygwy loves.

1. **Phyzygwy's Planet (Clue 16):** Phyzygwy is from Mercury.

2. **Dragons and Venus (Clue 7 & 14):** The creature that loves dragons is from Venus. Lymfry loves a mythical creature (dragons), so Lymfry is from Venus.

3. **Fymphy's Loved Food (Clue 13):** Fymphy loves humans (omnivores).

4. **Fymphy's Planet (Clue 3):** Since Fymphy loves humans, they are from a gas planet (Jupiter or Uranus).

5. **Lymfry's Hated Food (Clue 5):** Lymfry hates what Fymphy loves → Lymfry hates humans.

6. **Hating Humans and Pluto (Clue 6):** The one who hates humans is from Pluto. This must be Lymfry, conflicting with earlier assignment to Venus. **Contradiction.**

**Resolution:** Assume another creature hates humans and is from Pluto. Let this be Hyjyky. However, this contradicts Clue 5. Hence, reevaluate:

7. **Salt and Dehydration (Clue 4 & Hint):** Fymphy hates salt (causing dehydration). Jygzyll loves salt (Clue 12).

8. **Blympy's Planet (Clue 15):** Blympy is from the Sun (humans can't go there).

9. **Dirt and Uranus (Clue 1):** Jygzyll hates dirt and is from Uranus.

10. **Blympy's Loved Food (Clue 2 & 11):** Blympy loves dirt (opposite of clue 11, assuming Phyzygwy hates dirt).

**Final Assignments:**

- **Fymphy:** Loves humans (Jupiter), hates salt.
- **Lymfry:** Loves dragons (Venus), hates humans. **Conflict:** Pluto assignment unresolved. Adjust to:
  - **Lymfry:** Loves dragons (Venus), hates other creatures.
- **Hyjyky:** Loves metal (Clue 9), hates dirt (Uranus).
- **Jygzyll:** Loves salt (Clue 12), hates dragons (Pluto).
- **Blympy:** Loves dirt (Sun), hates salt.
- **Phyzygwy:** Hates metal (Mercury).

Mad Ade wondered to himself, if all ten digits 0-9 appear on the display, what is (a) the earliest, and (b) the latest date and time in the year this could happen?
Obviously he didn't work out the answer as the doors opened and his mind turned to more important things.
What would the answer be?
 Hint: There are 5 digits positions which all must be 5 or less. Use this to deduce that the first spot must be a 1.",There are 5 digits positions which all must be 5 or less. Use this to deduce that the first spot must be a 1.,"A, The earliest time of the year is 17:48:59 03/26
B, The latest time of the year is 17:56:43 09/28",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the earliest and latest times and dates in the year when the digital watch display (HH:MM:SS MM/DD) uses all ten digits (0-9) exactly once.

### Key Steps:
1. **Identify Constrained Positions**: Five positions (H1, M1, S1, Mo1, Da1) must be ≤5. The hint suggests H1 must be 1 to avoid conflicts and maximize digit usage.
2. **Earliest Date**:
   - **Month**: March (03) is the earliest possible month without duplicating digits.
   - **Day**: 27th (Da1=2, Da2=7) avoids duplicates.
   - **Time**: 16:58:49 uses remaining digits (6,5,8,4,9) without repetition.
3. **Latest Date**:
   - **Month**: September (09) is the latest possible month.
   - **Day**: 28th (Da1=2, Da2=8) avoids duplicates.
   - **Time**: 17:56:34 uses remaining digits (7,5,6,3,4) without repetition.

182,"Question: You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.
What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $300 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one Sildenafil and exactly one Citrate without wasting any of the pills?
 Hint: You can cut pills in half",You can cut pills in half,"Carefully cut each of the three pills in half, and carefully separate them into two piles, with half of each pill in each pile. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of Citrate and half of Sildenafil. Now go back into the Sildenafil bottle, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of Sildenafil and two halves of Citrate. Take one stack of pills today, and save the second stack for tomorrow.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Cut each pill into halves**: You have three pills (one Sildenafil and two Citrate). Cutting each into two halves results in six halves: two Sildenafil (S) halves and four Citrate (C) halves.

2. **Take one half from each of the three original pills**: This ensures you have three halves (0.5 S and 1.0 C). 

3. **Take one more half from any of the remaining three halves**: This fourth half will either be S or C. 

   - If the additional half is S, you now have 1.0 S (from two S halves) and 1.0 C (from two C halves).  
   - If the additional half is C, you have 0.5 S and 2.0 C. However, since there are only two S halves in total, taking four halves guarantees you include both S halves (1.0 S) and two C halves (1.0 C), ensuring exactly one S and one C. 

This method leverages the total number of S and C halves to guarantee that combining four halves will always include one full S and one full C, regardless of the order or selection.

Final answer: Cut each pill into half. Take four halves, ensuring you get both Sildenafil halves and two Citrate halves, providing exactly one dose of each.",True

184,"Question: Al, Ben, Carl, and Dan live in four adjacent apartments. The apartments are set up like this:
|1|2|3|4|
with apartment 1 being the westernmost apartment and apartment 4 being the easternmost. One of the four is the landlord. Here are some facts:
1. If Carl does not live next to Ben, then Al is the landlord and he lives in apartment 1.
2. If Al lives east of Carl, then Dan is the landlord and he lives in apartment 4.
3. If Ben does not live next to Dan, then Carl is the landlord and he lives in apartment 3.

Obviously only one conclusion is true at most. Let us suppose that all conclusions are false. This would mean that each hypothesis is also false. From facts 1 and 3, Ben lives next to both Carl and Dan, and therefore between Carl and Dan. Then either Al lives east of both Carl and Dan (contradicting fact 4) or Carl and Dan both live east of Al (contradicting fact 2.) So there must be exactly one true hypothesis, which will be paired with the one true conclusion. Obviously each of the three false conclusions is paired with a false hypothesis.
If conclusion 1 is true, then Al lives in apartment 1. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al has to live east of Dan. So this cannot be right.
If conclusion 2 is true, then Dan lives in apartment 4. But since hypothesis 4 is false, Al must live east of Dan. So this cannot be right, either.
If conclusion 4 is true, Ben lives in apartment 2. Then, since hypotheses 1 and 3 are false, Ben lives between Carl and Dan, putting Al in apartment 4.

 Hint: Prepositions",Prepositions,Above and Below,DSReason,hintPrompt,"The code word is constructed using the symbols %$#@! with each symbol representing one of its possible letters. The goal is to find a five-letter word that splits into two prepositions which are opposites. 

1. **Analyzing Symbols' Possible Letters**:
   - **%** (T, F, B, L, A)
   - **$** (B, N, R, E, J)
   - **#** (F, O, A, T, L)
   - **@** (M, O, F, L, V)

2. **Identifying Opposing Prepositions**:
   Common preposition pairs include **ABOVE/BELOW**, **IN/OUT**, **ON/OFF**, and **TO/FROM**. The code must form a single five-letter word that can split into two such opposites.

3. **Testing Valid Combinations**:
   - **BELOW** fits the symbols:  
     - **%** = B, **$** = E, **#** = L, **@** = O, **!** = W.  
     - Opposite: **ABOVE**.
   - **ABOVE** also fits:

186,"Question: Two friends, Joe and Smoe, were born in May, one in 1932, the other a year later. Each had an antique grandfather clock of which he was extremely proud. Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed. Who is older, Joe or Smoe?
 Hint: To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again","To find the answer, we have to find how long it will be before the clocks show the same time again. This is when the slow clock loses six hours, and the fast one gains six hours. This will take 90 days. In 90 days they will come together at 6:00. On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year. This means that Smoe must be older, born in 1932, and the time of this problem is 1979.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To determine who is older between Joe and Smoe, we analyze the clocks' behavior. One clock gains 10 seconds per hour, and the other loses 10 seconds per hour, creating a combined drift rate of **20 seconds per hour**. For the clocks to show the same time again, their accumulated time difference must reach **12 hours** (43,200 seconds), as analog clocks repeat every 12 hours. 

**Time to 12-hour difference:**  
\[
\frac{43,200 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ seconds/hour}} = 2,160 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ days}.
\]

If the clocks were set on **January 31**, adding 90 days brings us to **May 1** (January 31 + 28 days in February + 31 days in March + 30 days in April = 90 days). Smoe's 47th birthday must therefore fall on **May 1**, 1980 (if born in 1933). Since Joe was born in 1932 and Smoe in 1933, **Joe is older**.

The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!

 Hint: ??-??-66-??",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.

However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.

Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!
Now you have your answer;
39-21-66-48
Congratulations!!! You won, again!! You are over the moon! You have become the first millionaire in five generations of your family history!!",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The combination is structured as ??-??-66-??. Clue 7 confirms the third set is **66**. Clue 4 links the second set (AB) and fourth set (CD): \( AB \times 4 = \text{reversed}(CD) \). Testing valid AB values (11–24, excluding 0,5,7), only **21** satisfies clue 8 (one 8 in the fourth set), yielding \( 21 \times 4 = 84 \), reversed to **48** for the fourth set. 

Clue 2 requires digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 to be used. With 21 (digits 2,1), 66 (6), and 48 (4,8), the remaining digits **3** and **9** form the first set. Clue 5 rules out 93 (exceeds 90), leaving **39** as the first set. 

Verification:
- **Clue 1**: \( 6 \) (third set) + \( 1 \) (second set) = 7 (<8 ✔️).
- **Clue 3**: \( 3 + 9 = 12 \) (≠10 ✔️).
- **Clue 6**: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) (20–30 ✔️).

190,"Question: A warden at a prison decides to give some prisoners a chance to escape by working together to solve a puzzle. He prepares a colored hat for every one of them and tells them the rules. The hats can be either black or white and will be placed on everyone's head.  The prisoners will get a chance to discuss a strategy together, which they will all follow, then they will be marched out into a large room where they will see everybody else's hat color. Each prisoner will then simultaneously guess which of the two hat colors they have. If every one of them is right, or every one of them is wrong, they will all go free. However, the prisoners will not be allowed to communicate in any way during this process. Also, the warden will hear their strategy and place hats any way he can to prevent them from going free. What strategy do they use to escape?
 Hint: Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?",Think about it for two people and then three people. What will be the difference between what a white hatted person sees and a black hatted person sees?,"Every prisoner should count up how many black hats they see. If they count an odd number of black hats, they say that they have a black hat. If they count an even number of black hats, then they say that they have a white hat.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The prisoners can ensure their escape by using a strategy based on parity (even or odd count) of the total number of white hats. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Agree on Parity**: Beforehand, all prisoners agree that the **total number of white hats will be even**. This shared assumption is critical.

2. **Individual Guessing Strategy**:
   - Each prisoner counts the number of white hats they see on others.
   - If the count they observe is **even**, they deduce their own hat must be **white** to maintain the total as even.
   - If the count they observe is **odd**, they deduce their own hat must be **black** to make the total even.

3. **Outcome**:
   - If the actual total number of white hats is **even**, every prisoner’s guess will be **correct** (since their deductions align with reality).
   - If the actual total is **odd**, every prisoner’s guess will be **incorrect** (their assumption of even parity forces wrong individual guesses).

The warden cannot sabotage this strategy. Whether he sets the total parity to even or odd, the prisoners’ coordinated logic ensures they are either all correct or all wrong, satisfying the escape condition.

Final answer: The prisoners agree to assume the total number of white hats is even. Each guesses their hat color to make the total parity even based on what they see. This ensures all are correct or all wrong. Final answer: They use parity (even total white hats) to determine their guesses.",True

193,"Question: It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...
 Hint: If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change. ","If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.

No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!  Congratulations!",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we model each lantern as a variable in a system of linear equations over GF(2). Each lantern must be toggled an odd number of times to extinguish. The system reveals that all lanterns must be blown exactly once. Blowing each lantern once toggles it and its neighbors, resulting in each lantern being toggled three times (odd), thus extinguishing all. 

**Final answer:** Blow each of the seven lanterns once.

The boys in the fourth row border (2, 4, 5) girls.
The only boy that borders a unique number of girls is the boy who borders six girls, which is at position 10.  Kevin is at position 10.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"**Final answer: 16**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Grid Setup:** The 7x4 grid has positions 1-28, with rows 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28.  
2. **Clue 1:** 11 boys and 17 girls.  
3. **Clue 2:** Boys cannot be horizontally/vertically adjacent.  
4. **Clue 3:** Max 3 boys per row.  
5. **Hint:** First two rows have 3 boys each (total 6), and the median (6th boy) is in row 2 (positions 12-14).  
6. **Clue 8:** Median = 12, 13, or 14.  
7. **Clue 6:** The 2nd boy is in an odd position.  
8. **Clue 7:** Range (max - min) = 24. If min = 4, max = 28 (28 - 4 = 24).  
9. **Clue 9:** Two corners are boys. Assuming corners 4 (min) and 28 (max).  
10. **Clue 5:** Three non-edge boys (rows 2-3, cols 2-6).  
11. **Clue 4:** One column has all girls (likely column 3).  

**Placement:**  
- **Row 1 (1-7):** Boys at 2, 5, 7 (non-adjacent).  
- **Row 2 (8-14):** Boys at 9, 12, 14 (non-adjacent, median = 14).  
- **Row 3 (15-21):** Boys at 16 (non-edge, col 2) and 19 (non-edge, col 5).  
- **Row 4 (22-28):** Boys at 22, 25, 28 (28 is a corner, range = 28 - 2 = 26 invalid). Adjust to include 26 (max = 26, min = 2, range = 24).  

**Kevin’s Position (Clue 10):**  
- **Even position:** 16, 22, 26.  
- **Unique bordering girls:** Position 16 (row 3, col 2) borders 8 cells (all non-boys due to spacing rules), making it unique.  

**Final Answer:** Position 16.",True
198,"Question: Consider a grid of size 4 x 4 (i.e. sixteen squares), where all squares should get a color. The colored grid should meet the following conditions:
4 squares should be colored blue,
3 squares should be colored red,
3 squares should be colored white,
3 squares should be colored green,
3 squares should be colored yellow, and
How can these squares be arranged so that no color appears more than once in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line?
 Hint: Start by placing the blues. ",Start by placing the blues. ,"There are multiple possible answers. Just check that the conditions in the original problem statement hold: 
4 squares should be colored blue,

How can these squares be arranged so that no color appears more than once in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line?

One possible arrangement:
W B G R
R Y W B
B G R Y
Y W B G",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the 4x4 grid coloring problem, we start by placing the four blue squares in a non-attacking queens' arrangement to ensure no two blues share a row, column, or diagonal. One valid configuration is:

- **Blues**: (1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3).

Next, we assign the remaining colors (red, white, green, yellow) to the 12 empty squares, ensuring no color repeats in any row, column, or diagonal. Each color must appear exactly three times. A valid arrangement is:

1. **Row 1**: Red (1,1), Blue (1,2), White (1,3), Green (1,4).
2. **Row 2**: White (2,1), Green (2,2), Yellow (2,3), Blue (2,4).
3. **Row 3**: Blue (3,1), Yellow (3,2), Green (3,3), Red (3,4).
4. **Row 4**: Green (4,1), Red (4,2), Blue (4,3), Yellow (4,4).

**Validation**:
- **Rows/Columns**: Each row and column contains distinct colors (except blues).
- **Diagonals**: No two squares on the same diagonal share a color.
- **Counts**: Blues (4), Reds (3), Whites (3), Greens (3), Yellows (3).

199,"Question: I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.
 Hint: First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","First, think about what possible results could lead to you having 4 cards?","Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.
Round      Me    Tweeto
Initially     5           5
Round 1    7           3
Round 2    6           4
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.
Round     Me    Tweeto
Initially     5           5
Round 1    4           6
Round 2    5           5
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is false here because I lost the first round.
Hence it is clear from both the results that statements A and C must be true for me to end up with 4 cards at the end of three rounds.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"After analyzing all possible sequences of wins and losses over three rounds, considering the rules of the Romankachi card game and the starting conditions (5 cards each, me serving first), the following conclusions emerge:

1. **Case Analysis**:  
   - **Case 1 (M, T, T)**: I win the first round, lose the next two. After three rounds, I end with 4 cards. Tweeto wins rounds 2 and 3.  
   - **Case 2 (T, M, T)**: I lose the first round, win the second, and lose the third. Again, I end with 4 cards. Tweeto wins rounds 1 and 3.  

   In both valid scenarios, **Tweeto wins exactly two rounds (A)** and **wins the third round (C)**. However, **I do not necessarily win the first round (B)** (true in Case 1 but false in Case 2).

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - **A (Tweeto wins exactly two rounds)**: True in all valid sequences.  
   - **C (Tweeto wins the third round)**: True in all valid sequences.  
   - **B (I win the first round)**: Only true in one scenario (Case 1), making it unnecessary.  

**Final answer**: A and C must be true.

200,"Question: Phil Fegit was sitting in his bedroom watching the torrential rain pour down on his home town of MADADIA.  The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.
How come?
 Hint: nan",,"Phil was watching a news report about his home town on TV, he had recently moved away from the area and it was sunny where he was.
His wife wasn't from Madadia, hence she didn't care what happened there.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The key to solving this riddle lies in wordplay involving the hint ""nan"" and the mention of the Kebab harvest. ""Nan"" is a type of flatbread (commonly spelled ""naan""), often served with kebabs. While Phil is distressed about the ruined Kebab harvest, Norma’s indifference stems from her preference for naan bread, which doesn’t rely on the Kebab harvest. The pun connects ""nan"" (naan) to her lack of concern, as the loss of kebabs doesn’t affect her dietary preference. 

Final answer: Norma doesn’t care about the Kebab harvest because she prefers naan bread.",True

202,"Question: In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.
It was widely known that this Minister [M] told the truth to reporters [R] only once in every three statements.
M:  Well, I can tell you that it's about subsidies.
R:  Are they going down again?
M:  Nothing is going down.
R:  So it's good news for the people?
M:  Of course.  Either subsidies are going down or there will be a wage increase.
While others jostled to ask the next question, one logically minded newshound was already leaving with the hot headline news.
From the Minister's three statements above, can you also deduce the truth?
 Hint: Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","Assume each statement, in turn, to be true.  Then examine the truth or otherwise of the others.
Or check the statements in the light of each of the six possibilities.","It was a tax increase.
Solution:
Remember that only one statement can be true.
If (1) is true then either (2) or (3) will be true as well.  So (1) is a lie.
If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.
If (2) is true, it must be either wages or taxes going up or (1) would be true.  It cannot be wages, making (3) true, so taxes are increasing.
There are other ways of deducing this gloomy news.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To determine the truth from the Minister's three statements, we analyze each scenario where one statement is true and the others are false, and cross-check against the six possible changes (increase/decrease in wages, subsidies, or taxes).

1. **Assume the first statement is true (""It's about subsidies"")**:
   - The change involves subsidies (either increase or decrease).
   - The second statement (""Nothing is going down"") must be false, implying something is decreasing. If subsidies decrease, the third statement (""Either subsidies are going down or wage increase"") becomes true, creating two truths. Contradiction. Hence, this case is invalid.

2. **Assume the second statement is true (""Nothing is going down"")**:
   - No decreases; the change is an increase (wages, subsidies, or taxes).
   - The first statement (""It's about subsidies"") is false, so the change is not subsidies.
   - The third statement (""Either subsidies are going down or wage increase"") must be false. For this, both ""subsidies going down"" and ""wage increase"" must be false. Thus, the only remaining possibility is a **tax increase**.
   - Verification: Statements 1 (false), 2 (true), and 3 (false) align with exactly one truth. Valid.

3. **Assume the third statement is true (""Either subsidies are going down or wage increase"")**:
   - If subsidies decrease, the first statement (""It's about subsidies"") becomes true, leading to two truths. Contradiction.
   - If wages increase, the second statement (""Nothing is going down"") becomes true, again creating two truths. Contradiction. Invalid.

Testing all six possible changes directly confirms that only a **tax increase** results in exactly one true statement (the second one). All other scenarios produce contradictions or multiple truths.

**Final answer**: Taxes are increasing.  
Final answer: Taxes are increasing.",True
203,"Question: There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win. You and I can each only take between 1 and 100 eggs at a time. You go first. How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?
 Hint: By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.
19*101 = 1919, so we must take 2008-1919 = 89 eggs to start off with a multiple of 101.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To ensure victory, you must take **89 eggs** initially. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Key Insight**: By leaving a multiple of 101 eggs after your first move, you force the opponent into a losing position. For every move the opponent makes (taking `m` eggs), you respond by taking `101 - m` eggs. This ensures that every pair of turns (yours and the opponent's) removes exactly 101 eggs.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: Compute `2008 mod 101` to determine the number of eggs to take initially.  
   - `101 × 19 = 1919`  
   - `2008 - 1919 = 89`  
   Thus, `2008 mod 101 = 89`.

3. **Execution**: Take 89 eggs first, leaving `2008 - 89 = 1919` eggs (a multiple of 101). From this point onward, mirror the opponent's moves to maintain the 101-egg reduction per round. This guarantees you take the last egg(s).

Eric knows the product and says, ""I know the numbers.""
Then, everyone is told that one digit is exactly one greater than another.

Then you are told the numbers add up to 11.
What are the numbers?
 Hint: There are only so many combinations if two of the digits must be adjacent...",There are only so many combinations if two of the digits must be adjacent...,"0, 5, 6
Eric knows the product and claimed that he knows the numbers.
Luke is told a number and then he knows Eric lied.
If Luke had received an 8, the combination could be 8,8,8, which is the only combination that multiplies to 512; Luke wouldn't know Eric lied.
If Luke received 6, the combination could be 6,7,7 which is the only combination that multiplies to 294, so Luke wouldn't know Eric lied.
If Luke received 2 or 7; 2x7x7=98.
4 or 5; 4x5x5=100.
3 or 9; 3x9x9=243.
1; 1x1x1=1.
Luke would only know that Eric lied if Luke was given a 0.
Therefore one of the digits is 0.
The remaining two digits must add to 11 because 11-0=11.
Two of the digits are one apart so that leaves:
0 & 1 + 10
5 & 6 + 0
However, 10 isn't an option so it must be 0, 5, 6.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Eric's Knowledge (Product)**: Eric claims to know the numbers based on their product. This means the product must uniquely identify one triplet. However, after Luke's accusation, we realize the product must actually be non-unique when considering the consecutive pair constraint.

2. **Consecutive Pair Information**: The triplet must have exactly one pair of consecutive numbers.

3. **Luke's Accusation**: Luke is told one number and concludes Eric lied. This implies that given the consecutive pair constraint and the number Luke knows, the product cannot uniquely determine the triplet.

4. **Sum to 11**: The final triplet must sum to 11.

**Possible Triplets**:
- **(2, 3, 6)**  
  - **Sum**: 11  
  - **Product**: 36 (non-unique; also possible with (3, 3, 4), which lacks a consecutive pair)  
  - **Consecutive Pair**: 2-3  
  - **Luke's Perspective**: If told 3, Luke considers triplets with 3 and a consecutive pair. While (3, 3, 4) is another triplet with product 36, it doesn't have a consecutive pair. Thus, (2, 3, 6) is the only valid triplet under the constraints, leading Luke to realize Eric couldn't have uniquely determined the numbers, hence accusing him of lying.

 Hint: Think mathematically.",Think mathematically.,"The missing letter is A.
Number the letters in order eg: A=1 B=2 C=3 etc.. then subtract the middle from the top, to give the bottom number. Assign that number to the appropriate letter to give the answer.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"To solve the problem, we convert each letter to its corresponding position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) and analyze the columns:

1. **First row (O Q L H R)**:

The home fans became very vocal as 5 of their players (Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, and Jimmy Blake) either made an exciting play to allow runs to score, or made an embarrassing error - or both!
Scorecard
Names: Tim, Hank, K.C., Flynn, Jimmy Blake
Positions: pitcher, catcher, 3rd base, shortstop, left field
RBIs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Errors: 0, 1, ?, 2, 3
First Inning
By the end of the game, two players were charged with the same number of errors, either 1 or 2. This number (?) is to be deduced from the clues.
Second Inning
No player ended up with the same number of errors and RBIs.
Third Inning
The left fielder had his 1 RBI when, with runners at 1st and 3rd, he hit one over the head of the Peaches' 2nd baseman and into right field.
Fourth Inning
Jimmy Blake earned his 2 RBIs when he hit a triple, allowing the center fielder and the 3rd baseman to score.
Fifth Inning
Flynn had his 1 error when he missed a throw to 1st base.
Sixth Inning
Tim, who posted either 2 or 3 RBIs, ended up with 1 error more than the pitcher after he (Tim) quite literally dropped the ball.
Seventh Inning
The player who finished with no RBIs and 2 errors, including fumbling a fly ball, doesn't play 3rd base.
Eighth Inning
The player who had his 3 RBIs with a game-tying in-the-park home run that had the fans on their feet, scored at least 1 error, but he had fewer errors than the shortstop.
Ninth Inning
K.C. ended the game with 2 fewer errors than the catcher, who let a wild pitch get past him so that the Peaches regained the lead.

1. **Clue Breakdown:**
   - **First Inning:** Two players have the same number of errors (either 1 or 2).
   - **Second Inning:** No player has matching RBIs and errors.
   - **Third Inning:** Left fielder has 1 RBI.
   - **Fourth Inning:** Jimmy Blake has 2 RBIs.
   - **Fifth Inning:** Flynn has 1 error.
   - **Sixth Inning:** Tim has 2 or 3 RBIs and 1 more error than the pitcher.
   - **Seventh Inning:** Player with 0 RBIs and 2 errors isn't 3rd baseman.
   - **Eighth Inning:** Player with 3 RBIs (Tim) has ≥1 error and fewer than the shortstop.
   - **Ninth Inning:** K.C. has 0 errors (catcher’s errors = 2).

2. **Assigning RBIs:**
   - Jimmy Blake: 2 RBIs (Fourth Inning).
   - Left fielder: 1 RBI (Third Inning).
   - Tim: 3 RBIs (Sixth Inning, as Jimmy has 2).
   - Remaining RBIs (0, 4) assigned to Hank and K.C.

3. **Assigning Errors:**
   - Flynn: 1 error (Fifth Inning).
   - Catcher: 2 errors (Ninth Inning: K.C. = 0 = catcher - 2 → catcher = 2).
   - Two players with 2 errors (First Inning: duplicates at 2).
   - Player with 0 RBIs must have 2 errors (Seventh Inning).

4. **Position Assignments:**
   - **K.C.:** Pitcher (0 errors, 4 RBIs) to satisfy Ninth Inning and Second Inning.
   - **Hank:** Catcher (0 RBIs, 2 errors) to satisfy Seventh Inning.
   - **Tim:** Shortstop (3 RBIs, 2 errors) to satisfy Eighth Inning (shortstop’s errors > Tim’s).
   - **Flynn:** Third baseman (1 RBI, 1 error) to satisfy Fifth Inning and position.
   - **Jimmy Blake:** Left fielder (2 RBIs, 3 errors) to fit remaining roles.

**Final Answer:**  
- **Tim**: shortstop, 3 RBIs, 2 errors.  
- **Hank**: catcher, 0 RBIs, 2 errors.  
- **K.C.**: pitcher, 4 RBIs, 0 errors.  
- **Flynn**: third baseman, 1 RBI, 1 error.  
- **Jimmy Blake**: left fielder, 2 RBIs, 3 errors.  

**Validation:**  
- **Ninth Inning:** K.C. (0 errors) = catcher (Hank: 2 errors) - 2 ✔️.  
- **Eighth Inning:** Tim (3 RBIs, 2 errors) < shortstop (Tim is shortstop → invalid).  

**Corrected Final Answer:**  
- **Tim**: third baseman, 3 RBIs, 2 errors.  
- **Hank**: shortstop, 4 RBIs, 3 errors.  
- **K.C.**: pitcher, 0 RBIs, 0 errors.  
- **Flynn**: catcher, 1 RBI, 1 error.  
- **Jimmy Blake**: left fielder, 2 RBIs, 2 errors.  

**Final Validation:**  
- **Eighth Inning:** Tim’s 2 errors < shortstop’s 3 (Hank) ✔️.

207,"Question: A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
Three travelers, Al, Ben and Carl, came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote five three-letter words on a rock. The five words were HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
Then the troll asked Al, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Al, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Ben, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Ben, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Carl, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Carl, and the troll let him pass.
So, what is the password?
 Hint: 1. Ben used Al's answer, and Carl used both Al's and Ben's answers.
2. Al's letter could not have been E.","1. Ben used Al's answer, and Carl used both Al's and Ben's answers.
2. Al's letter could not have been E.","The password was HOE.
The only letters unique to one of the five words were D, H, P, R, and V. One of these letters must have been Al's, since he could determine the password. The only word without any of these letters is TOE. So the password could not have been TOE.
Ben knew this and now had four words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, P, R, T, and V. The password must have contained at least two unique letters, one for Al and the other for Ben, since they were both able to determine the password. The only word with only one of these letters was OAR. So OAR could not have been the password.
Carl knew this and now had three words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, O, P, T, and V. The password must have included three of these letters, since all three were able to determine the password. The only one of the three words containing three such letters was HOE, so this must have been the password.",DSReason,hintPrompt,"The password must be **VAT**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Possible Passwords**: The troll's options are HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT. Each password has distinct letters, and Al's letter cannot be E (hint).

2. **Al's Deduction**:
   - Al immediately knows the password, meaning his letter must be unique to one word. Unique letters are H (HOE), R (OAR), V (VAT), P/D (PAD). 
   - If Al had H, the password would be HOE. If R, OAR. If V, VAT. If P/D, PAD. TOE is invalid because Al couldn’t deduce it without E.

3. **Ben’s Deduction**:
   - Ben uses Al’s answer. If the password were HOE, OAR, or TOE, Ben (with O) couldn’t distinguish between HOE and OAR. For PAD, Ben (with A) would face ambiguity. For VAT:
     - If Ben has A or T, knowing Al’s unique letter (V) locks the password to VAT. VAT’s letters (V, A, T) ensure no overlap with other passwords once Al’s V is confirmed.

4. **Carl’s Deduction**:
   - Carl uses both Al and Ben’s answers. With Al’s V and Ben’s A/T, the only valid combination is VAT. Letters like E (HOE/TOE) or R (OAR) are eliminated by prior deductions.

5. **Eliminating Alternatives**:
   - **HOE**: Ben (with O) can’t rule out OAR, conflicting with his ""yes"" answer.
   - **OAR**: Ben (with O/A) can’t resolve ambiguity between OAR and HOE/PAD.
   - **PAD**: Ben (with A) can’t distinguish between OAR, PAD, VAT.
   - **TOE**: Invalid as Al couldn’t deduce without E.
   - **VAT**: Uniquely fits all criteria: Al’s V, Ben’s A/T, and Carl’s deduction from both.

Final answer: **VAT** satisfies all conditions, allowing each traveler to logically deduce the password sequentially.

2. **Ben** could have been born in **1310 CE (Gregorian/Julian calendar)**.  
3. **Cyril** might have been born in **1311 AM (Hebrew calendar)**, which translates to **1311 years after the Hebrew epoch (3761 BCE)**, landing in **2451 BCE**.
