0,"Question: It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

The year is 2003.  This is the only year from 2000 to 2007 where Christmas is on a Thursday.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,,True
1,"Question: The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'
""If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators.""
*note - the only difference from Scenario B, the original position of the 2 switches are known.
 Hint: Assuming that:
A) There is no restriction on the amount of time the prisoners could take before sending the notice to the warden that everyone has been to the switch room at least once.
B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","Assuming that:

B) There is no restriction on the number of time each prisoner can visit the switch room
C) The warden will not attempt any foul moves, such as intentionally not bringing a certain prisoner to the switch room forever.","1.        Appoint a ""scorekeeper"" and the other 22 prisoners as ""transmitters"".
2.        When a transmitter enter the switch room for the first time, he will flick switch B ON if he sees it in the OFF position.  Alternatively, he will flick switch A if he sees switch B is in the ON position and waits for his next visit.  The transmitter's mission is to find ONE opportunity to flick switch B to the ON position.  After he completes his mission, he will flick switch A for all subsequent visits.  In short, each transmitter's role is to send a signal to the scorekeeper that he has been to the switch room.
3.        The scorekeeper's role is to flick off switch B whenever he sees it in the ON position.  Each time he flicks off switch B he adds 1 to his score.  When he sees switch B is already OFF, he flicks switch A instead and does not add to the score.  As soon as he accumulates 22, he reports to the Warden.",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Step 1.  Agree on two special roles
• Exactly one prisoner is elected the Leader.  
• The other 22 prisoners are called the Non-leaders.

Step 2.  Agree on the function of the switches
• Switch A (the left-hand one, say) will be the “signal/ counter” switch.  
• Switch B will be the “waste” switch that is used only to satisfy the rule that a prisoner must always move some switch.

Both switches start in the OFF position and everybody knows this.

Step 3.  What every Non-leader does when he is taken to the switch room
a) If he has never before turned switch A on, and switch A is OFF now, he flips switch A to ON. (That is his one and only personal “I’ve been here” signal for the Leader.)  
b) In every other circumstance he ignores switch A and instead flips switch B (from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON, whichever it is at the moment).  
Thus each Non-leader turns switch A on exactly once in his lifetime; afterwards he only toggles B.

Step 4.  What the Leader does when he is taken to the switch room
• If switch A is ON, he flips it back to OFF and increases his private count by 1.  
• If switch A is OFF, he flips switch B instead.  
(Remember: the Leader is the only person who ever turns A off.)

Step 5.  Finishing condition
When the Leader’s private count reaches 22 he knows that every one of the 22 Non-leaders has already visited the switch room at least once, so he announces:
“We have all visited the switch room.”

Why the strategy is correct

1.  Each Non-leader is able to send exactly one unmistakable signal (turning A from OFF to ON) no matter how often or in what order the warden selects prisoners, because every prisoner remembers whether he has already sent his signal.

2.  Only Non-leaders ever turn A on, and only the Leader ever turns it off, so each time the Leader finds A = ON he is certain that it represents a brand-new Non-leader visit.

3.  There are exactly 22 Non-leaders, so after the Leader has seen A on and turned it off 22 times he knows with certainty that all Non-leaders have appeared at least once. (He himself has obviously appeared too, or he could not have done the counting.)

4.  Because the warden is assumed to be fair in the long run (hint C), every prisoner will eventually be taken to the switch room infinitely often, so the Leader’s count will eventually reach 22 and the announcement will be made. No incorrect announcement can ever occur, because the Leader cannot reach 22 until each distinct Non-leader has supplied exactly one signal.

Hence the prisoners will invariably succeed and be released.

Final answer:  Designate one prisoner as Leader, use switch A as the single-visit signal and switch B as a harmless “waste” switch.  Non-leaders turn A on once (otherwise toggle B); the Leader turns A off and counts.  When the Leader has turned A off 22 times he declares that everyone has visited, guaranteeing freedom.",True

The letters must all be different digits and A ≠ 0 (no leading zero).

Step 1 – try D = G·4 (rule 4).  
Because 4·3 = 12 is two-digit, the only possibilities are  
 G = 1  →  D = 4 or G = 2  →  D = 8.

•  G = 1 forces F = 0 (rule 7), and then rule 6 makes A = 4, duplicating D, so G = 1 is impossible.  
•  Therefore G = 2 and D = 8.

Step 2 – use rule 7 with G = 2.  
Either G = F + 1 (so F = 1) or G = I – 3 (so I = 5).  
Take G = F + 1, hence F = 1.

Step 3 – rule 6 with F = 1.  
F cannot be 2·B (that would need B = 0.5), so F = A – 4 ⇒ A = 5.

Step 4 – rule 1 with A = 5, G = 2.  
5 ≠ B/3, but 5 = 2 + 3, so rule 1 is satisfied with A = G + 3.

Step 5 – rule 8.  
Because A is odd, A/2 is not integral, so H = C·3.

Step 6 – rule 3 with F = 1.  
C = F·3 = 3, and then H = 3·3 = 9.

Step 7 – rule 10 with H = 9, C = 3.  
Choose J = H – 2 = 7.

Step 8 – rules 4 and 5 give D = 8 and E.  
E cannot equal D/4 (=2) because 2 is already G, so use E = J – 1 = 6.

Step 9 – rule 2 with E = 6.  
B = E + 4 is impossible (10), so take B = I – 4.

Step 10 – rule 9.  
H + 3 = 12 (>9), so choose I = D / 2 = 4.  
Then B = I – 4 = 0.

All ten digits are now fixed:

A = 5 B = 0 C = 3 D = 8 E = 6  
F = 1 G = 2 H = 9 I = 4 J = 7.

Step 11 – verify each rule (at least one option true).  
1) 5 = 2 + 3 ✔  2) 0 = 4 – 4 ✔  
3) 3 = 1·3 ✔  4) 8 = 2·4 ✔  
5) 6 = 7 – 1 ✔  6) 1 = 5 – 4 ✔  
7) 2 = 1 + 1 ✔  8) 9 = 3·3 ✔  
9) 4 = 8 / 2 ✔  10) 7 = 9 – 2 ✔

All conditions are satisfied and every digit 0–9 appears exactly once.

Final answer: 5038612947",True
4,"Question: Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?
 Hint: It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,hintPrompt,"Place 1000 equally–spaced points on a circle and label them 0,1,2,…,999 counter-clockwise.  
Choose a fixed step k (1≤k≤999) and draw straight segments

0→k→2k→3k→⋯   (indices taken mod 1000)

until you return to 0.  
The figure obtained is the regular star polygon {1000/k}.  
When does it satisfy the conditions in the question?

1. The drawing must be one continuous closed line that visits every vertex exactly once before returning to the start.  
   This happens iff k is coprime to 1000, i.e. gcd(k,1000)=1.  
   (Otherwise you come back to 0 too early and the picture splits into several smaller polygons.)

2. The picture must actually be a “star”, i.e. we must skip at least one point each time.  
   Therefore k≠1 and k≠999 (k=999 is the same as k=–1 which also gives the ordinary 1000-gon).

3. The star drawn with step k is identical (just traced the opposite way) to the one drawn with step 1000−k.  
   Hence we should count k and 1000−k only once.

Consequently

number of different 1000-point stars  
= ½ · (number of k with 1<k<999 and gcd(k,1000)=1).

The count of integers 1≤k≤999 that are coprime to 1000 is Euler’s totient

φ(1000)=1000·(1−1/2)·(1−1/5)=1000·½·4/5=400.

Remove k=1 and k=999, leaving 400−2=398 permissible step sizes.  
Dividing by 2 to identify mirror images gives

398 / 2 = 199.

Final answer: 199",True
