0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Identify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.  Name the order that the daughters were born in and the day of the week that they leave to go home.  What is the seating arrangement at the dinner table?
Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.
A designated driver remains sober in order to drive people who've had too much alcohol home.

1. (Rudimentary)  List all of the relevant categories (7 daughters, 7 boy-friends, 7 sports, 7 majors, 7 schools, 7 departure days, 14 seats at the table) and build an empty logic grid to keep track of the clues.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Transcribe every explicit clue from the story into the grid (e.g. first three daughters attend Ivy-League schools, next two attend UCLA & Berkeley, two youngest are abroad; each couple leaves on a different day, etc.).  

3. (Creative)  Notice that “all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table” and decide which sports count as ball sports (football, water-polo, baseball, golf).  This supplies a powerful seating constraint.  

4. (Creative)  Use the champagne-passing dialogue (“Mom handed the bottle to Lars on her left … Gabrielle please pass the bottle around …”) to pin down where Mom is, that Lars is immediately to Mom’s left, and that Gabrielle is next after Lars; this fixes one entire corner of the table and orients left/right.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Apply the stated seating rules (parents on the ends, every couple sits directly across from each other, genders alternate boy-girl-boy-girl down each side) to begin filling seats relative to Mom, Lars and Gabrielle.  

6. (Creative)  Exploit “Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first” to place those three in the remaining empty chairs nearest the father’s end and thereby lock in which side of the table is the ball-sport side.  

7. (Creative)  Use “the biologist is sitting between the two fighters” to put Brooke (biology) between the fencer (Edward) and the wrestler (James), fixing those three consecutive seats.  

8. (Creative)  Use “I’m sitting between the two best passers at the table” spoken by the youngest to locate the quarterback (Kyle) and the water-polo player (Hank) and, from that, identify the youngest daughter (Christie) and her exact seat.  

9. (Creative)  Combine Dad’s golf invitation (“I have a tee time …” to the golfer’s boyfriend) with the earlier mention that Lars is the golfer to match Lars with Angelina, place that couple opposite Mom and set their attributes (Harvard/business/golf).  

10. (Rudimentary)  Convert the education remarks (three Ivy-Leaguers, two UC schools, two foreign schools; one daughter at Dad’s alma mater Harvard) into a complete birth-order list tied to schools.  

11. (Rudimentary)  Extract the travel clues (business-major couple leaves first because of an east-coast storm; six successive departure days after that; who will be present to see Grandma; who can still go wedding-dress shopping) to produce a chain of departure days.  

12. (Creative)  Thread all individual travel clues together so that every couple departs on a unique, ordered weekday, arriving at the final schedule Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri-Sat-Sun-Mon.  

13. (Creative)  Combine the New-Year’s-Eve hotel remarks, the “walking-distance from our apartment” comment and the knowledge of which couples attend UCLA vs. Berkeley to tie boy-friends, daughters and schools to their correct cities.

Creative Steps: 6  
Rudimentary Steps: 4  

Steps:  
1) (Creative) Note that the digits 0 – 9 sum to 45.  Since the first‐half sum (A+B+C+D+E) must be a multiple of 6 and the second‐half sum (F+G+H+I+J) a multiple of 5, the only way to partition 45 into such multiples is 30 and 15, respectively.  Likewise, the alternating-position sums must partition 45 into 27 (multiple of 9) and 18 (multiple of 2).  

2) (Rudimentary) List all two-digit multiples required by conditions 5–9 (multiples of 3, 4, 7, 8, 10) and immediately discard any whose two digits are identical (33, 44, …, 99) because all ten digits must be different.  

3) (Creative) Condition 9 forces J = 0 (since IJ is a multiple of 10).  For JA to be prime (condition 10), A can only be 2, 3, 5, or 7.  Eliminate any AB candidates (multiples of 3) whose first digit is not one of these.  

4) (Creative) Because FE and HC must be prime (condition 10), C and E cannot be even or 5 (no prime > 5 ends in an even digit or 5).  Remove any remaining CD (×4) and EF (×7) candidates whose second digits violate this.  

5) (Creative) From condition 4, B+D+F+H+J = 18.  D, H, J are even (they finish multiples of 4, 8, 10), so B and F must have the same parity.  If they were both even, the sum would exceed 18, hence B and F are odd.  Applying this to the current lists leaves only EF = 91, giving E = 9 and F = 1; delete any candidates that place 1 or 9 elsewhere.  

6) (Rudimentary) After the previous eliminations, every surviving AB contains the digit 7, so 7 is fixed in the A-B pair.  Likewise, every surviving CD contains the digit 3, fixing 3 in the C-D pair; discard any option that moves 7 or 3.  

7) (Creative) Using condition 1 (A+B+C+D+E = 30) together with E = 9 and the partial knowledge about AB and CD, the only way to reach 30 is CD = 36 and AB = 57 (75 is impossible because 5 is already needed elsewhere).  Thus C = 3 and D = 6; eliminate any candidate contradicting these placements.  

8) (Rudimentary) Among the remaining GH (×8) possibilities, every viable one contains 4, so fix 4 in the GH pair and remove any that places 4 elsewhere.  

9) (Creative) Apply condition 3 (A+C+E+G+I = 27).  With A = 5, C = 3, E = 9, the remaining G+I must equal 10.  The only surviving multiples that satisfy all earlier constraints are GH = 24 and IJ = 80, giving G = 2, H = 4, I = 8, J = 0 and fixing AB = 57.

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 11

5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):

At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):

Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 16

Steps:  
1. (R) Read clue 8 to identify the character at the lowest level (10) and note that this same character uses a dagger.  
2. (C) Introduce the variable x for the cross-bow user’s level, then use clue 4 to set up the relations: paladin = x + 8 and Raj = x + 16, while bounding x so that no level exceeds 32 and none equals the already–known 10.  
3. (C) Combine clue 6 with clue 2 and clue 11 to state that the elf is not any of the three characters in Step 2 and must be 10 levels higher than the kobold fighter, giving three algebraic possibilities for the elf’s level (20, x + 10, x + 18).  
4. (C) Bring in the remaining numeric conditions—level 24 must appear (clue 1), two levels differ by 4 (clue 7), and one level is twice another (clue 3)—to create a compact set of tests for x.  
5. (R) Test x = 11, 12, 13, 15 against the numeric conditions and rule each value out.  
6. (R) Test x = 14 against those same conditions and rule it out.  
7. (R) Conclude x = 16, producing the level set {10, 16, 20, 24, 32}; assign the elf to level 20 (clue 7) and identify Leonard as the 16-level cross-bow user.  
8. (R) Use clue 1 to start a “five-slot” list: Penny / 24-level ogre / thief / fireball user / orc fighter.  
9. (R) Combine the level-10 dagger holder (Step 1) with clue 6 to show that the kobold fighter is also level 10; since Penny and the ogre are not level 10, assign these facts to the thief.  
10. (R) Apply clues 4 and 12 to note that neither Penny nor the ogre uses the cross-bow, forcing the orc fighter (one of the five slots) to be Leonard and to wield the cross-bow.  
11. (R) Use clue 3 (bolo level is twice the halfling level) together with the known levels to put the bolo on Penny, identify the thief as the halfling, and note that the ogre therefore holds the mace.  
12. (R) Deduce from the remaining open slot that Raj, the only unfilled high-level character, must be the 32-level fireball user, and confirm Penny as the 20-level elf who fights chimeras (clue 7).  
13. (R) Invoke clue 10 to prevent the giant fighter from using a mace; since the ogre has the mace, assign harpy fighting to the ogre and giants to Raj.  
14. (R) Apply clue 5 (hobbit is “no good” at giants) to shift the orc-fighting cross-bow role to the hobbit, thereby labeling Leonard as the hobbit; with elf, hobbit, halfling, and ogre taken, Raj becomes the gremlin, and by clue 9 the gremlin must be the sorcerer.  
15. (R) Use clue 7 (“Leonard isn’t the archbishop”) to give Leonard the merchant role and make Penny the archbishop.

7,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.",,"Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

8,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.

2. (R) Apply clue 1.3 to see that broccoli is planted one day after the work done in the west end, so broccoli can only be on the 28 th, 29 th, or 30 th, while “west” can only be the 27 th, 28 th, or 29 th.  
3. (R) Apply clue 3.3 to relate lettuce and the south garden: lettuce is planted one day after the south-side work, so lettuce can only be on the 28 th, 29 th, or 30 th and the south side on the 27 th, 28 th, or 29 th.  
4. (R) Observe that, with the above windows, Tomatoes can only fall on May 25 or 27.  
5. (R) Use clue 2.2 (“one week’s last day” = Saturday, May 25) to assign the East side of the garden to May 25.  
6. (R) Use clue 1.4 (tomatoes are not in the East) to eliminate tomatoes from the East side.  
7. (C) Combine the time-line deductions of Steps 1, 4, 5, 6 to lock in East = Radishes on May 25, Tomatoes on May 27, and—three days after May 25—Peppers on May 28.  
8. (C) Use clue 3.4 (peppers have more rows than broccoli; broccoli not West nor May 29) together with the current calendar to fix Broccoli on May 30 and Lettuce on May 29.  
9. (R) Re-apply clue 1.3: if Broccoli is May 30, the “west” work must be May 29.  
10. (R) Use clue 3.2 to restrict Lettuce to fewer than three rows (so either 1 or 2).  
11. (R) Use clue 2.4 to state that the Northwest corner must contain an even number of rows (2 or 4).  
12. (R) Use clue 1.2 about planting-depth/range to exclude certain row counts: Radishes not 1 or 5; Broccoli not 4 or 5; Tomatoes not 1 or 2.  
13. (C) Apply clue 2.3 (peppers and tomatoes are not in the Northwest) together with the current location assignments to conclude that the Northwest corner must contain Broccoli.  
14. (R) Combine Step 11 (NW must be 2 or 4 rows) with Step 12 (Broccoli cannot be 4 or 5 rows) to set Broccoli at 2 rows in the Northwest corner.  
15. (R) Because Lettuce is <3 rows and 2 rows are now used by Broccoli, assign Lettuce 1 row.  
16. (R) Use clue 2.1 to put exactly 3 rows in the South side, which is already known (from Step 7) to be Peppers; therefore Peppers = 3 rows.  
17. (R) The only remaining unused permissible row count that satisfies Step 12 for Radishes is 4 rows; assign Radishes 4 rows.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Apply clue 5 to Column G: keep only numbers whose tens digit is smaller than the units digit.  Because clues 1 and 11 allow the numeral 5 to appear only once on the whole card, that 5 must be in Column G; the only viable choice is G1 = 58.  Eliminate every other candidate on the card that contains the numeral 5.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Use clue 6 to strike out every even number from Column O, leaving only odd possibilities there.  

3. (Creative)  Exploit clue 1 (each numeral 0–9 appears exactly once in Row 1) together with clue 3 (one two-digit prime per row).  Remove any Row-1 option that is one-digit or has repeated digits, then allocate the needed digits so that Row 1 eventually contains 10 in B1, 24 in I1, and an entry containing the digit 6 in O1 while pruning conflicting primes (29, 59, etc.).  

4. (Creative)  Invoke clue 10: the sums of all five columns must share one prime factor.  The only possibility is 31, so each column sum must be a multiple of 31.  Matching the still-available values gives target sums B = 31, I = 124, N = 155, G = 248, O = 341.  From this, fix several cells: G1 = 58, O1 = 67, N1 = 39, G5 = 46, and O5 = 61.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Determine Column N.  The only combination that both totals 155 and satisfies clues 4, 8, 9 is {34, 39, 40, 42}.  Hence N5 = 34 and the other three numbers 39, 40, 42 occupy the remaining N-cells.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Examine Column I.  Two candidate sets total 124: {16,24,26,28,30} and {20,22,24,28,30}.  To keep Row 1’s digit-uniqueness (clue 1) choose the second, forcing I1 = 24.  That simultaneously settles B1 = 10.  Using diagonal-sum clue 12, place G4 = 48 and deduce B5 must be odd.  

7. (Creative)  Use clue 7 (exactly one column is in descending order) to pick Column B as that column.  Combined with clue 8 (each column has exactly one duplicated numeral), fix B2 = 9 and B5 = 1 so that B now reads 10, 9, 8, 3, 1 top-to-bottom.  

8. (Rudimentary)  Make Row 4 add to a square number per clue 2.  The only attainable square is 196, forcing the assignments B4 = 3, I4 = 30, N4 = 42, and O4 = 73.  

9. (Rudimentary)  With Column B and Column N nearly complete, the only remaining fitting values are B3 = 8 and N2 = 40.  

10. (Creative)  Apply the product-digit clues: B3 × O3 ends in 2 (clue 13) and I3 × G3 ends in 4 (clue 14).  The only consistent placements are O3 = 69, O2 = 71, G3 = 47, and G2 = 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

15,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).

16,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.

5. (Creative)  Combine clues 4 and 5 with the colors already placed:  
   • Green must be immediately left of White.  
   • Blue is already in House 2, so the only viable pair is Green → House 4 and White → House 5 (other pairings contradict color or beverage information).  
6. (Rudimentary)  From clue 5, note that the owner of Green (House 4) drinks Coffee.  
7. (Rudimentary)  Remaining colors are Red and Yellow for Houses 1 and 3.

11. (Rudimentary)  Keep clue 6 (Pall Mall → Birds) in reserve; possible houses for that pair are 3, 4, or 5 at this point.  
12. (Rudimentary)  Use clue 12: Bluemasters → Beer.  House 5 is the only house with an unassigned drink and cigar, so put Bluemasters and Beer in House 5.  
13. (Creative)  Combine clues 10 and 15: the Blends smoker must be next to both Cats and Water.  
    • End houses (1 or 5) have only one neighbor, so Blends cannot be there.  
    • If Blends were in House 3, Cats and Water would need to occupy both Houses 2 and 4, but House 2 already has Tea.

From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.
1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.
2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

Rows, top to bottom, are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  An example of coordinate nomenclature: B1 identifies column B row 1.  N3 is a free space (contains no number).  No number appears more than once.
1) All numbers in row 2 are divisible by 2; all numbers in row 3 are divisible by 3; all numbers in row 4 are divisible by 4; all numbers in row 5 are divisible by 5.
2) Row 2: the units digits are the same.
3) Row 4: the units digits are all different.
4) Row 5: the sum of the numbers is divisible by 7.
5) Column B: contains five consecutive numbers (in any order).
6) Column I: three of the numbers are odd.
7) Column G: three numbers are divisible by 3; three numbers are divisible by 4; one number is divisible by 12.
8) Column O: the sum of the five numbers is an odd number.
9) The product of I3 and G3 is between 1300 and 1400.
10) The sum of B1 and O1 is 82.
11) The difference between N1 and N5 is 1.

Steps:  
1) [Rudimentary]  Apply clue 1 to strike out every number that is not a multiple of 2 in row 2, not a multiple of 3 in row 3, not a multiple of 4 in row 4, or not a multiple of 5 in row 5.  

2) [Creative]  Combine clue 6 with the parity restrictions from clue 1: rows 2 and 4 must hold even numbers, so the three odd numbers required in column I must sit in rows 1, 3, 5.  Of the remaining possibilities, the only odd number available for row 5 is 25, so set I5 = 25.  

3) [Rudimentary]  Use clue 7 together with the fact that row 5 needs a multiple of 5 to choose G5 = 60 (the only candidate satisfying all of column G’s divisibility requirements).  

4) [Creative]  From clue 9, look for a pair (I3, G3) whose product lies between 1300 and 1400.  Within the allowable ranges, the unique pair is 27 × 51 = 1377, giving I3 = 27 and G3 = 51.  

5) [Creative]  Apply clue 13 (N4 is midway between I1 and G1).  Because I1 must be odd (row 1 has no even restriction) the midpoint will only be an integer if G1 is also odd.  Testing the odd candidates leaves the triple I1 = 23, G1 = 57, N4 = 40.  

6) [Rudimentary]  From clue 10 (B1 + O1 = 82) note that B1 cannot be below 7 and O1 cannot be below 67, otherwise their sum would be too small.  

7) [Rudimentary]  Using clue 2 and the remaining candidate for G2, observe that every entry in row 2 must end in 6; therefore no number ending in 0, 4, or 8 can stay in that row.  

8) [Rudimentary]  Work with clue 5, “column B contains five consecutive numbers,” to discard any collections in column B that are not contiguous.  

9) [Creative]  Use clue 12 (N2 is midway between B4 and O4).  After eliminations, only N2 = 36 works, which forces O4 to be either 64 or 68.  

10) [Rudimentary]  Enforce the “units digit 6” condition for row 2 (clue 2): set B2 = 6, G2 = 56, O2 = 66, which in turn fixes G4 = 52.  

11) [Rudimentary]  Re-examine clue 5 with the latest information to lock column B into the consecutive set that starts with B1 = 7.  

12) [Rudimentary]  With B1 now known, clue 10 immediately yields O1 = 75.  

13) [Rudimentary]  Apply clue 3 (row 4 must have distinct units digits).  The only fit in column I is I4 = 16, leaving I2 = 26.  

14) [Creative]  For row 5, clue 4 says the sum must be divisible by 7.  The only totals possible with the numbers collected so far are 175 or 210.  Because 25 + 60 = 85, only 210 works, so choose B5 = 10, N5 = 45, O5 = 70.  

15) [Rudimentary]  Finish satisfying clue 5 (consecutive numbers in column B) by assigning B3 = 9 and B4 = 8.  

16) [Rudimentary]  Since row 4 still needs a number whose units digit is different from 0, 2, 6, and ? … and O4 had been narrowed to 64 or 68, pick O4 = 64 to keep the digits distinct, completing row 4.  

17) [Rudimentary]  Clue 8 requires column O’s five-number sum to be odd; this forces O3 = 72.  

18) [Rudimentary]  Finally, clue 11 says N1 and N5 differ by 1.  With N5 = 45 fixed, N1 must be 44, completing the entire card.",,18,"['Total Step Count: 18  \nCreative ', ' 5  \nRudimentary Steps: 13  \n\nSteps:  \n1) [Rudimentary]  Apply clue 1 to strike out every number that is not a multiple of 2 in row 2, not a multiple of 3 in row 3, not a multiple of 4 in row 4, or not a multiple of 5 in row 5.  \n\n2) [Creative]  Combine clue 6 with the parity restrictions from clue 1: rows 2 and 4 must hold even numbers, so the three odd numbers required in column I must sit in rows 1, 3, 5.

21,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1.

23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00	Derec
6:10	Adele	0:10 later
6:40	Brand	0:30 later, 0:40 after Derec
7:30	Elena	0:50 later, 1:30 after Derec, 1:20 after Adele
7:50	Caleb	0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.
Finally, we have Caleb and Derec to fill the first and last spots.  Caleb and Nora share a birth position.  The first paragraph mentions that Cogita is Nora's older sister, so Caleb cannot be the firstborn.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10

Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.

3. (Creative)  Test 8 4 2: with A = 8, C = 2, clue #1 forces D = 1.  Because clue #5 already needs C or H to be 1, D cannot be 1; hence 8 4 2 is impossible.  Thus C = 1 and the remaining triples are 9 3 1 or 4 2 1.

The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.

1. Assign numbers 1-5 to the five pyramids and place the letters of the starter word MANGO on pyramids 1–5 respectively. (R)

3. From OCHRE and the PEACH restriction that C and H cannot share O’s pyramid, deduce the only PEACH letter that can go with O is P, so place P on pyramid 5. (C)  
4. CANDY forbids C from sharing N, so put C with M on pyramid 1 and H with N on pyramid 3. (C)

28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated",,"Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

2. Conclude that June is also telling the truth (despite the possibility that the Switcher might later move the Liar role), noting that June’s first-statement position means she could have been swapped only after she spoke. (Rudimentary)

4. Eliminate “Cupid” and “Normal” for Emma by invoking (a) the rule that Cupid cannot pair themselves and (b) Xavior’s true statement “Draco or June is Normal,” which blocks Emma from being Normal. (Rudimentary)

5. Eliminate “Detective” and “Spy” for Emma by noting her own true statement “I don’t know the Spy”; since both Detective and Spy would know who the Spy is, Emma cannot hold either role, leaving “Switcher” as the only option for her. (Creative)

2. (Creative)  Use clue 9 (“no more than three girls on any diagonal”).  If 33 were a girl the main diagonal 1-9-17-25-33 would contain four girls, so position 33 must be a boy.  

3. (Creative)  Invoke clue 8 (“at least two girls in every column”).  To reach two girls in columns 3 and 5, force girls into 10 and 24 (column 3) and into 12 and 26 (column 5).

5. (Creative)  Re-examine diagonals after the new placements.  Without a boy at 32 the short diagonal 28-32 would push its girl count above three, contradicting clue 9; therefore put a boy at 32.  

6. (Creative)  Two boys remain unplaced.  Clue 9 limits them to the set {6, 18, 30}.  Using clue 6 (sum of boys’ positions < 315), note the present boy total is 289; the added boys must contribute ≤ 25.

Without a boy at 32 the short diagonal 28-32 would push its girl count above three, contradicting clue 9; therefore put a boy at 32.  \n\n6. (Creative)  Two boys remain unplaced.  Clue 9 limits them to the set {6, 18, 30}.  Using clue 6 (sum of boys’ positions < 315), note the present boy total is 289; the added boys must contribute ≤ 25.  Choosing 6 and 18 (total 24) satisfies both conditions, so 6 and 18 are boys and 30 is a girl.  \n\n7.

(Creative)  Apply the final part of clue 1: Stacey is on the line with Rhonda and Teresa but borders neither of them.  In both candidate triples the only member not adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the other two is position 12.  Therefore Stacey’s picture is in position 12.']",7,2
32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.

To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 19

Steps:  
1. Recognise that only two rooms (one triple, one twin) are available and must accommodate all five men. (Rudimentary)  
2. From clue 1, note the two compulsory pairings: the CEO with the ABM delegate, and Edgar with the Developer. (Rudimentary)  
3. Combine clues 3 and 8 to see that, because the CEO shares with the IT Analyst and Grimaldi is either CEO or IT Analyst, Grimaldi must be in the same room as the CEO, the IT Analyst and the ABM delegate (and could be one of them). (Creative)  
4. Use clue 6 (“Edgar did not share with Carl”) to place Carl in the same room as the CEO / IT Analyst / ABM / Grimaldi group, since Edgar is in the other room. (Rudimentary)  
5. Apply clue 5: Clarkson shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both. Because Grimaldi is in Carl’s room, Thomas must be in the other room with Clarkson; therefore Thomas and Clarkson share, and Thomas is not with Grimaldi. (Rudimentary)  
6. Collect the information so far: Room 1 contains the CEO, IT Analyst, ABM delegate, Grimaldi, Carl and the Reed Right delegate (clue 4 keeps Reed Right away from Thomas); Room 2 contains Edgar, the Developer, Thomas and Clarkson. (Rudimentary)  
7. Using clue 7 (Chiptech delegate shared with Lantel delegate) and the fact that Room 1 already has three distinct occupants, deduce that Chiptech and Lantel must both be in Room 2; otherwise Room 1 would have four men, impossible for a triple room. (Creative)  
8. Because the CEO shares with the IT Analyst and also with the ABM delegate (clues 1 & 8), conclude that the IT Analyst is the ABM delegate. (Creative)  
9. Since the Reed Right delegate is in Room 1 but is not the ABM delegate, the CEO must work for Reed Right. (Rudimentary)  
10. Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right (clue 3), so within Room 1 he must be the ABM IT Analyst. (Rudimentary)  
11. The surnames Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are already assigned to Room 2 occupants, so the only surname left for the Reed Right CEO in Room 1 is Graves. (Rudimentary)  
12. Eliminate first-name possibilities for Graves (he cannot be Edgar, Thomas, Carl or Alan) to identify him as Joshua. (Rudimentary)  
13. In Room 2 Clarkson cannot be Thomas (already identified), Edgar (surname Casson), Carl or Joshua, so Clarkson’s first name must be Alan. (Rudimentary)  
14. The Director’s company cannot be Lantel or Blue Teeth (clue 2) and cannot be Reed Right or ABM (already assigned in Room 1), leaving Chiptech, so the Director works for Chiptech. (Rudimentary)  
15. The Director is not Graves, Grimaldi, Clarkson or Fielder, leaving Casson as the Director. (Rudimentary)  
16. With Graves already used, the only first name that matches “Casson” under clue 6 is Edgar, so Edgar Casson is the Director. (Rudimentary)  
17. Alan Clarkson’s company cannot be Reed Right, ABM, Lantel or Chiptech, so he works for Blue Teeth. (Rudimentary)  
18. Because the Blue Teeth delegate is the Accountant who shared with the Developer (clue 12) and Alan Clarkson is already the Blue Teeth delegate, Alan must be the Accountant. (Rudimentary)

33,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 20

5)  With column 2 now full of girls, declare the remaining vacancies in that column, 10, 18, 34, to be boys. (Rudimentary)

37,"Six sets of twins ( a boy and a girl in every case) made several errors in their history and geography examinations; and it was noted that every girl made precisely the same number of errors as her brother in the two subjects. Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.",,"Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole.

Creative Steps: 3  
Rudimentary Steps: 19  

Steps:  
1. From clue 8 fix Susan’s history errors at 7; since no one scores 9 in history, Anne must have either 11 or 12 history errors. (R)  
2. Clue 1 says Louella does not have 6 history errors; coupled with clue 10 this limits Louella to 10 or 11 history errors. (R)  
3. Assume Louella has 11 and Anne 12; this forces Susan’s geography to be one less than Louella’s and Gail’s to be one more than Anne’s—but 13 geography errors do not exist, so this branch is impossible. (C)  
4. Try Louella 10 and Anne 11; again Susan or Gail would need 13 geography errors, which is impossible, so Anne must have 12 history errors and Louella 10. (C)  
5. Using clues 8 and 10: the twins with 11 history errors have a geography total one more than Susan and one less than Gail, giving Gail 12 or 16 geography errors, Susan 10 or 14, and the 11-history twins 11 or 15 geography errors. (R)  
6. Clue 4 forbids the twins who make 11 geography errors from also making 11 history errors, so those with 11 history errors must have 15 geography errors; therefore Gail has 16 geography errors and Susan 14. (C)  
7. Clue 6 gives Edward 12 history errors, making him Anne’s brother; clue 6 also leaves Edward & Anne with 11 or 12 geography errors, and puts Luke & his sister at 10 or 11 geography errors—one of them must have 11. (R)  
8. Clue 1 (Louella not Luke’s sister) plus clues 5 & 6 let Luke (and, by clue 5, David) take either 6 or 8 history errors; pairing constraints make Gail David’s sister. (R)  
9. Clue 3 forces Anne to 11 geography errors and Louella to 12, which in turn fixes Luke at 10 geography errors. (R)  
10. Using clue 1, Sammy’s sister must be Susan. (R)  
11. From clue 12 Wendy has 10 geography errors, which pushes Diane to 15 geography errors. (R)  
12. Because Wendy’s brother shares her geography score of 10, he must be Luke; clue 12 also tells us Luke is not the boy with 8 history errors, so Luke takes the 6-history slot, leaving David with 8 history errors. (R)  
13. By elimination Sammy must have the remaining history total, 7, confirming again that he is Susan’s brother. (R)  
14. Clue 11 links Martin one step away in geography from his sister who out-scores Diane in history, forcing Martin’s sister to be Louella. (R)  
15. With Louella paired, the only brother left for Diane is George. (R)  
16. Clue 2 now identifies Edward’s surname as O’Connell and states that the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy. (R)  
17. Combine clues 7 and 9 to analyse the Waters, Seal, and McCall families and their history/geography totals. (R)  
18. That analysis forces the Seal twins to own the 14-geography score and the Waters twins the 16-geography score. (R)  
19. Hence Sammy & Susan are Seal, David & Gail are Waters. (R)  
20. The only surname left that fits Diane’s pair is Vole. (R)  
21. Clue 7 prevents Martin from being McCall, so—since Louella or Wendy must be Dean—Martin & Louella take the Dean surname, leaving Luke & Wendy as McCall. (R)  
22. Compile all remaining facts to present the final roster:  
   • David & Gail Waters – 16 G / 8 H  
   • Edward & Anne O’Connell – 11 G / 12 H  
   • George & Diane Vole – 15 G / 11 H

From clue 8 fix Susan’s history errors at 7; since no one scores 9 in history, Anne must have either 11 or 12 history errors. (R)  \n2. Clue 1 says Louella does not have 6 history errors; coupled with clue 10 this limits Louella to 10 or 11 history errors. (R)  \n3. Assume Louella has 11 and Anne 12; this forces Susan’s geography to be one less than Louella’s and Gail’s to be one more than Anne’s—but 13 geography errors do not exist, so this branch is impossible. (C)  \n4. Try Louella 10 and Anne 11; again Susan or Gail would need 13 geography errors, which is impossible, so Anne must have 12 history errors and Louella 10. (C)  \n5. Using clues 8 and 10: the twins with 11 history errors have a geography total one more than Susan and one less than Gail, giving Gail 12 or 16 geography errors, Susan 10 or 14, and the 11-history twins 11 or 15 geography errors. (R)  \n6. Clue 4 forbids the twins who make 11 geography errors from also making 11 history errors, so those with 11 history errors must have 15 geography errors; therefore Gail has 16 geography errors and Susan 14. (C)  \n7. Clue 6 gives Edward 12 history errors, making him Anne’s brother; clue 6 also leaves Edward & Anne with 11 or 12 geography errors, and puts Luke & his sister at 10 or 11 geography errors—one of them must have 11. (R)  \n8. Clue 1 (Louella not Luke’s sister) plus clues 5 & 6 let Luke (and, by clue 5, David) take either 6 or 8 history errors; pairing constraints make Gail David’s sister. (R)  \n9. Clue 3 forces Anne to 11 geography errors and Louella to 12, which in turn fixes Luke at 10 geography errors. (R)  \n10. Using clue 1, Sammy’s sister must be Susan. (R)  \n11. From clue 12 Wendy has 10 geography errors, which pushes Diane to 15 geography errors. (R)  \n12. Because Wendy’s brother shares her geography score of 10, he must be Luke; clue 12 also tells us Luke is not the boy with 8 history errors, so Luke takes the 6-history slot, leaving David with 8 history errors. (R)  \n13. By elimination Sammy must have the remaining history total, 7, confirming again that he is Susan’s brother. (R)  \n14. Clue 11 links Martin one step away in geography from his sister who out-scores Diane in history, forcing Martin’s sister to be Louella. (R)  \n15. With Louella paired, the only brother left for Diane is George. (R)  \n16. Clue 2 now identifies Edward’s surname as O’Connell and states that the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy. (R)  \n17. Combine clues 7 and 9 to analyse the Waters, Seal, and McCall families and their history/geography totals. (R)  \n18. That analysis forces the Seal twins to own the 14-geography score and the Waters twins the 16-geography score. (R)  \n19. Hence Sammy & Susan are Seal, David & Gail are Waters. (R)  \n20. The only surname left that fits Diane’s pair is Vole. (R)  \n21. Clue 7 prevents Martin from being McCall, so—since Louella or Wendy must be Dean—Martin & Louella take the Dean surname, leaving Luke & Wendy as McCall. (R)  \n22. Compile all remaining facts to present the final roster:  \n   • David & Gail Waters – 16 G / 8 H  \n   • Edward & Anne O’Connell – 11 G / 12 H  \n   • George & Diane Vole – 15 G / 11 H  \n   • Luke & Wendy McCall – 10 G / 6 H  \n   • Martin & Louella Dean – 12 G / 10 H  \n   • Sammy & Susan Seal – 14 G / 7 H']",3,19

First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks.

40,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party?

How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?",,"The Order the finished in was: Ben, Paul, Jessica, Stephen, Brianna, Clark, Luke, Anna, Kelsey, Felicia, Brad, Abby.
Here is how they got there:
On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.
On the third lap the 10th and 11th place people switched spots, putting Kelsey in 10th, and Felicia in 11th. 5th and 6th place switched, making Brianna in 5th, and Clark in 6th, and the 7th and 8th place people switched, putting Luke in 7th and Anna in 8th. Brad was passed by the two people who were directly behind him which made Kelsey in 9th, Felicia in 10th, and Brad in 11th. Jessica was also passed by Paul, the person directly behind her, putting Paul in 2nd, and Jessica in 3rd.
Their new ranks are:

5. I is not 1.",,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6.

2. (Rudimentary) Test I = 2.  This forces E = 3 and G = 6.  Because H > G (Clue 4) and the three row-sums must fit inside the overall total of 45 (Clue 1), the bottom-row maximum would be 14, which is impossible; hence I ≠ 2.

46,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML. If N is between FKO and GLM, GLM can scramble, and G can be anywhere touching FKO, except N cannot touch L. When G-[L/M]-N are consecutive in either direction, FKO can straddle that subgroup. That makes 126 arrangements - 21 for each FKO order.
Here are the 21 arrangements, using xxx for the interchangeable FKO.

1. Decide to count every seating arrangement as identical to its mirror image (e.g., ABCD = DCBA), reducing the total number of distinct linear arrangements to be considered. (Rudimentary)

2. Notice that the three ladies who speak only English – Mrs. F, Mrs. K, and Mrs. O – can always converse with one another but with nobody else unless an English-speaker is beside them, so it is advantageous to keep them consecutive as one interchangeable block “FKO.” (Creative)

3. Observe that Russian is spoken only by Mrs. H and Mrs. J; therefore H must sit next to J, and because nobody else can talk to J, the pair “JH” (with J on the extreme end so H can still talk to someone else) must form a block anchored at either end of the row. (Creative)

4. Treating “FKO” as one block and “JH” as another, count the two possible placements for “JH” around “FKO,” knowing that H must be the member of the pair adjacent to the FKO block. (Rudimentary)

5. Form a French-speaking block “GLM” (G speaks English & French, L only French, M French & German) that must sit on the other side of FKO and adjacent to someone who can speak French; in the present configuration this leaves just one slot next to FKO but opposite the JH block for “GLM.” (Creative)

6. Multiply the possibilities so far: 2 positions for JH × 6 internal permutations of FKO × 1 fixed position for GLM = 12 raw arrangements, which reduce to 6 distinct arrangements after accounting for mirror symmetry. (Rudimentary)

7. Introduce Mrs. N (English & German) without disturbing the existing blocks; she can go in five different places: two inside the FKO trio, one between FKO and H, one between FKO and G, or one beside M.  That yields 5 × 6 = 30 arrangements when FKO, JH, and GLM stay intact. (Rudimentary)

8. Analyze the effect of inserting N in positions that allow blocks to split: if N is next to M outside the GLM block, the French block can turn into “GML”; if N wedges between FKO and GLM, the French trio can be permuted further, and G can slide along the edge of FKO provided N does not end up next to L; finally, when G-(L/M)-N appear consecutively, the FKO trio can straddle that sub-group.  These observations create additional admissible patterns beyond the previous 30. (Creative)

Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man.
Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Who is fair, handsome and unscarred?",,"Cliff Hedge is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:
Case 1 :: ? (N, ?, ?) : Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) : ? (N, ?, ?) : ? (?, ?, ?)
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, ?) : Mad Ade (?, ?, ?) : ? (N, ?, ?) : ? (Y, Y, N)
Note the representation - Name (Fair, Handsome, Scarred). ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) means Mad Ade is Fair, Handsome and Unscarred.(oh, how true this is..NOT)
It is clear that either Mad Ade or the man at the extreme right is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (4), it is deduced that Cliff Hedge is standing next to unscarred man and each of the other men standing next to exactly one scarred man.

Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, Y) : Mad Ade (?, ?, Y) : ? (N, ?, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
From (3), Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man. But in Case 1, Cliff Hedge is standing next to exactly one handsome man. Hence, Case 1 is not possible and Case 2 is the correct one.
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, Y) : Mad Ade (?, ?, Y) : ? (N, ?, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)

52,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches.

Only one of these combinations is a 'silent' combination that eliminates all sound, by turning off all three active machines.
4) Label outside switches related to active machines (those marked with 'x' in the silent combination) with A, B, and C. Label outside switches related to inactive machines with D and E.

4. Rudimentary – Label the three outside switches that produced silence A, B, C (active group) and the remaining two D, E (inactive group).  
5. Creative – For the inactive group set D = OFF, E = ON so the two already-stopped saws are in different outside-switch states.  
6. Creative – For the active group set A = ON, B = ON, C = OFF, creating three distinct run histories for the active saws.  
7. Creative – Wait long enough for the saw tied to C to cool, then switch B OFF; only the saw on A is still running, C is cool, B is warm.  
8. Rudimentary – Re-enter the room.

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.

1. (Rudimentary)  From the facts that exactly three of the six men lie and that “neither set of brothers consists exclusively of liars,” conclude that neither set of brothers can consist exclusively of truthtellers either; each family must contain a mix of liars and truth-tellers.  

2. (Creative)  Test Boris’s statement “Both my brothers tell the truth.”  
 •  If it were true, all three Paleys would be truthtellers, contradicting Step 1.  
 •  Therefore Boris is a liar.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Examine Chuck’s statement “Alan and Boris are both liars.”  
 •  Because Boris is already known to be a liar, Chuck’s sentence can be true only if Alan is also a liar, and it can be false only if Alan is a truthteller.  
 •  Hence exactly one of the pair {Alan, Chuck} tells the truth and the other lies.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Count truth-values so far.  Two men (Boris and one of {Alan, Chuck}) are liars; two (the other of {Alan, Chuck} and one as-yet-unknown) are truthtellers.  Therefore among Dalman, Edwin, and Finney there must be exactly one more liar and two more truthtellers.  

5. (Creative)  Use Finney’s first remark “Edwin tells the truth.”  
 •  If Finney were a liar, Edwin would also be a liar, creating two liars in the trio of {Dalman, Edwin, Finney}, contradicting Step 4.  
 •  Hence Finney tells the truth, Edwin tells the truth, and Dalman is the single liar in that trio.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Finney’s second truthful remark “Boris is one of the Paleys” establishes that Boris is indeed a Paley.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Edwin’s truthful remark “Boris and I are brothers” makes Edwin a Paley as well.  

8. (Creative)  Dalman’s statement “Chuck and I are brothers” is false, so Chuck and Dalman are not brothers.  Because the Paley family already contains Boris and Edwin, exactly one of Chuck or Dalman is a Paley and the other a Thomson; consequently the two remaining men, Alan and Finney, must both be Thomsons.  

9. (Creative)  Finney Thomson is a truthteller (Step 5).  Alan Thomson’s remark “Both my brothers tell lies” conflicts with Finney’s truthfulness, so Alan must be the liar of the Thomson family; therefore Chuck is the Thomson who tells the truth.

55,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.

56,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.

58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?",,"There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.
Now trying different EVEN values for G, starting with 2; there were total 6 friends and 60 Golden kebab tokens. The Golden kebab tokens are divided among 5 friends and hence each friend ends up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary) Introduce variables: let G be the number of friends (G < 10) and N the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend receives in the initial equal split, so the total number of tokens is T = NG.  

2. (Creative) Translate the “divide by families” suggestion into algebra: because two pairs of sisters become one family each, the number of recipient units would drop from G to G − 2, and each family would receive N + 5 tokens, giving a second expression for the same total: T = (N + 5)(G − 2).  

3. (Rudimentary) Equate the two expressions for T and simplify:  
   NG = (N + 5)(G − 2) → NG = NG − 2N + 5G − 10 → 2N = 5G − 10 → N = (5/2)G − 5.  

4. (Rudimentary) Note that N must be an integer, so (5/2)G must be an integer; since 5 is odd, G must be even.  

5. (Creative) Observe that the same pile of tokens must be divisible by G (initial split), by G − 2 (family split), and by G − 1 (after Wendy withdraws), imposing simultaneous divisibility constraints on T.  

6. (Rudimentary) Systematically test the even values of G less than 10 (2, 4, 6, 8) against those constraints; find that G = 6 satisfies them.  

7. (Rudimentary) Substitute G = 6 into N = (5/2)G − 5 to get N = 10 and compute the total number of tokens: T = NG = 6 × 10 = 60.

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1).

-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field

So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9

1. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue [2] together with the fact that each team’s total runs is even to deduce that, for each team, exactly 3 of the 7 games must have an even run total and the remaining 4 games must have an odd run total.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Interpret clue [3] (“no two games whose run products are prime”) to notice that a product can be prime only if one factor is 1 and the other is prime, hence conclude that neither team ever scored exactly 1 run.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Combine clues [1] (4 prime–run games) and [4] (2 perfect–square–run games) to see that these account for 6 of the 7 games for each team, leaving exactly one game whose run total is neither prime nor a perfect square.  

4. (Rudimentary)  List all legal run totals from 0 through 12 (excluding the disallowed 1 and 5) and classify them as prime {2, 3, 7, 11}, square {0, 4, 9}, or neither {6, 8, 10, 12}.  

5. (Creative)  Observe that every “neither-prime-nor-square” number is even, so—given the 3-even/4-odd split—exactly two of the six prime/square games must be even and the rest odd.  Combine this with the single-shut-out condition to restrict which square numbers (0, 4, 9) each team can take.  

6. (Creative)  From the restriction in Step 5 and the single shut-out, conclude that the team with the shut-out must have square set {0, 4} or {0, 9}, while the other team’s square set must be one of {4, 4}, {4, 9}, or {9, 9}.

8. (Creative)  Knowing the Reds’ scores, deduce the Tigers’ square pair must be {4, 4}; this forces all four of their prime-run games to be odd, meaning the Tigers never scored below 3 runs in any game.  

9. (Rudimentary)  Compare the two teams’ game-by-game constraints: since the Tigers always scored at least 3, the Reds could have won at most the three games in which they scored 7, 9, or 12 runs.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Notice that the ten digits 0-9 sum to 45.  Because clue 1 says the two disjoint 4-digit groups each add up to the two-digit number AD, removing A and D from the 45 must leave a total (45 – A – D) that is twice AD.  Solving 2·AD = 45 – (A + D) restricts AD to the list 14-22.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Check each candidate sum from 14 to 22 against 2·AD = 45 – (A + D).  Only AD = 18 (A=1,D=8) and AD = 21 (A=2,D=1) satisfy the equation, so {A,D} = {1,8} or {2,1}.

67,"The penthouse suite of Auckland's Victoria Residences  has become available. Seven married couples (including Mr. and Mrs. Officer) who are current tenants (on the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th floors) are taking advantage of an open house to have a peek at what life is like at the top. Each of the men (including Frank) has recently scaled one of the ""Seven Summits"" - the highest peaks of each continent (including Puncak Jaya of Oceania). Meeting each other during this peek at the penthouse has piqued their interest in scaling all the peaks. The wives (including Linda) are not climbers, but are looking forward to travelling with their husbands to each continent.
From the information given below, can you determine the first and last name of each mountaineer, the floor on which he lives, the peak that he climbed, as well as the name and hair color of his wife?
1. Nora's husband is three floors below Mr. Simpson and four floors above the man who climbed Vinson Massif. These three men are Adam, Brian, and Charles. Their wives all have the same hair color.
2. Mr. Riley is two floors below Edmund and two floors above the man who climbed Mont Blanc (who is not Mr. Peary). These three men's wives are Heidi, Iris, and Jane. Two of these women have red hair, while the other is blonde.
3. Kate's husband is somewhere below David and somewhere above the Kilimanjaro climber (who isn't Charles). These three men are Mr. Simpson, Mr. Tailor, and Mr. Upton. Two of their wives are brunette, while the other is blonde.
4. George lives somewhere below Mr. Tailor (who isn't Edmund) and three floors above Mona's husband. These three men are the ones who climbed Aconcagua, Denali, and Vinson Massif. Each of their wives has a different hair color.
5. Mrs. Quarry is two floors below the wife of the Everest climber and two floors above Iris. None of these three is blonde.
6. Heidi lives somewhere below Brian's wife and somewhere above the Aconcagua climber's wife.",You might start by determining on which floor the Simpsons live.,"David Tailor, who lives on the 11th floor, climbed Denali. His wife, Linda, is a blonde.

Rudimentary Steps: 13  

Steps:  
1. (R)  Draw a grid including the seven available floors (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11) and the five attributes that have to be matched: first name, surname, peak climbed, wife’s name and wife’s hair colour.  

2. (R)  Enter the complete lists of possibilities in the grid: the seven first names (Adam, Brian, Charles, David, Edmund, Frank, George), the seven surnames (Officer, Peary, Quarry, Riley, Simpson, Tailor, Upton), the seven peaks, the seven wives (Heidi, Iris, Jane, Kate, Linda, Mona, Nora) and the three hair colours (blonde, brunette, redhead – with repetitions where the clues allow).  

3. (R)  Translate every numbered clue literally into grid language (higher/lower-than relations, equalities and inequalities, hair-colour sets, etc.).  

4. (C)  Notice in clue 3 that the three surnames in that chain are Simpson, Tailor and Upton, and that “David” is the only first name mentioned there – therefore David must be Mr Tailor.  

5. (R)  Recall from clue 4 that “Mr Tailor isn’t Edmund,” confirming that Edmund must have some other surname (this merely checks consistency and removes one combination from the grid).  

6. (C)  Because David is “somewhere above” the other two men in clue 3 and 11 is the only uppermost floor, place David Tailor on floor 11.  

7. (C)  Still in clue 3, the lower-than chain forces two consecutive placements below 11. With 9 and 5 unavailable, the only pair that keeps the two-step ordering intact is floors 10 and 7. Hence Kate’s husband must live on 10 and the Kilimanjaro climber on 7.  

8. (R)  Use the rest of clue 3 to pin names to those floors: Kate’s husband is the Simpson in the trio, so Brian Simpson goes to 10, leaving Adam Upton at 7 to be the Kilimanjaro climber.  

9. (R)  From clue 1 record that Adam, Brian and Charles will all have wives with the same hair colour; enter that requirement in the grid (actual colour still unknown).  

10. (C)  Work clue 2 (“Mr Riley is two floors below Edmund and two floors above the Mont Blanc climber”) against the available floor list; the only 3-member, evenly-spaced stack possible is Edmund on 8, Riley on 6 and the Mont Blanc climber on 4.  

11. (R)  Supply first names for those positions: Edmund Quarry goes on 8, George Riley on 6, the yet-unidentified man on 4 becomes the Mont Blanc climber.  

12. (C)  Bring in clue 4: George lives three floors above Mona’s husband and below Mr Tailor. With George fixed at 6 and Tailor at 11, Mona’s husband must be on 3.  

13. (R)  Clue 4 also says Tailor, George and Mona’s husband climbed (in some order) Aconcagua, Denali and Vinson; record the trio of peaks against floors 11, 6, 3, leaving the exact allocation open.  

14. (C)  Use clue 1’s spacing (Nora’s husband is three floors below Mr Simpson and four floors above the Vinson climber). With Brian Simpson on 10 and Nora’s husband Adam Upton on 7, Vinson must be four floors below 7, i.e. on 3. That fixes Mona’s husband as the Vinson climber and therefore identifies him as Charles. Because the Mont Blanc climber cannot be Mr Peary (clue 2) and Charles is now known, the only surname left for the man on 3 is Peary – so Charles Peary stands at 3 with Vinson.  

15. (R)  The only unused surname for the Mont Blanc man at 4 is Officer; place Frank Officer on floor 4 with Mont Blanc.  

16. (C)  Only Aconcagua and Denali remain for floors 6 and 11. Bring in clue 6 (“Heidi is below Brian’s wife and above the Aconcagua climber’s wife”). Heidi is Mrs Quarry at 8 and Brian’s wife Kate is at 10, so Aconcagua’s wife has to be below 8. The wife below 8 is Iris on 6, so George Riley on 6 must be the Aconcagua climber, leaving Denali for David Tailor on 11.  

17. (R)  Now the peak list is complete; from clue 4 note that the wives of the Denali, Aconcagua and Vinson climbers (Linda, Iris and Mona) have three different hair colours – mark that in the grid.  

18. (C)  Apply clue 5: Mrs Quarry (Heidi) is two floors below the Everest climber’s wife and two above Iris, and none of the three is blonde. With Heidi on 8 and Iris on 6, Everest’s wife must live on 10. Hence Brian Simpson (floor 10) is the Everest climber. Record that Kate (his wife) is not blonde, and confirm the brunette/redhead status of the three women.  

19. (R)  Combine the hair-colour information from clues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to settle every woman’s colour: Linda (blonde), Kate (brunette), Nora (brunette), Heidi (redhead), Iris (redhead), Jane (blonde), Mona (brunette).  

20. (R)  All attributes are now uniquely matched; list the seven couples to give the final solution exactly as stated:  
• David Tailor – 11 – Denali – wife Linda (blonde)  
• Brian Simpson – 10 – Everest – wife Kate (brunette)  
• Edmund Quarry – 8 – Puncak Jaya – wife Heidi (redhead)  
• Adam Upton – 7 – Kilimanjaro – wife Nora (brunette)

Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.",,"First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.
In either case, Chuck is the liar.
D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.  In these cases you ask the person who is neither the liar or the truth teller a question you know the answer to.  In cases C & D you've identified Chuck as either the liar or truth teller.  At this point you simply ask Chuck a question to identify either Alex or Bob.
So the final question and results for each case are:
A) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the truth teller?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is unreliable, Bob is the liar and Chuck is the truth teller;
""no"" means that
Alex is the liar, Bob is the truth teller and Chuck is unreliable.
B) You ask Bob ""Is Alex the liar?""
""yes"" means that
Alex is the truth teller, Bob is the liar and Chuck is unreliable;

Your objective is to end up having 4 liters of water in each pool, and one liter of water in the 9-liter jug.
You have nothing else at your disposal and you can not measure using eye or shape of jugs. You can not pour water from pools, only into them.","This needs 29 steps to fill two pools with 4-liters, and an additional 4 steps to get 1 liter in the 9-liter jug, for a total of 33 steps.","Label the 10-liter jugs as A and B, the 9-liter jug as C, and the two pools as Pa and Pb. The problem can be solved in 33 steps, as shown below. Each step is shown in one row, starting with the step number, followed by the jug we poured water from, then the quantity of water, then the jug/pool we poured water into... i.e. A ->( 1)-> Pb means we poured 1 liter of water from jug A (being 1st 10-liter jug)  to pool Pb  (being 2nd pool).

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?",,"Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.

77,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?",,"Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

1) Use clue 2 to strike every non-prime from Row 1.  
2) Use clue 3 to strike every non-composite from Row 5.  
3) Apply clue 1 to Rows 2–4, deleting numbers that prevent each column from being monotone (either entirely ascending or descending).  
4) Combine clue 4 (equal intervals in Column I) with clue 8 (I₂·G₂ = I₃·G₃) to narrow the choices in Columns I and G.  
5) With clue 10 (each column needs one multiple of 6) deduce that I₂ is 18 or 24 and G₃ is 48 or 54, trimming Column G further.  
6) Use clue 7 (B₄·O₅ = B₅·O₄) to test the remaining possibilities and discard the ones that fail for B₄, B₅, O₄ and O₅.  
7) Invoke clue 5 (four different O–column gaps) together with clue 7’s surviving products to force O₄ = 70, O₅ = 75, B₄ = 14, B₅ = 15 and hence O₁ = 61.  
8) From clue 10 note 66 is the only multiple of 6 left for Column O; place it in O₃ (not O₂, or the O-interval 5 would repeat), leaving O₂ = 63 or 64.  
9) Apply clue 9 (N₄ midway between B₄ and G₄) to set N₄ = 33 and G₄ = 52, which then fixes G₁ = 59, G₂ = 57 and G₃ = 54.  
10) Using the equal-interval requirement (clue 4) and the already fixed I₂ = 18, complete Column I as 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.  
11) Because Column N must descend (from clues already satisfied) set N₅ = 32.  
12) Employ clue 6 (Row 1 sum = Row 5 sum) to achieve the common total 189, forcing B₁ = 11, N₁ = 41 and G₅ = 46.  
13) Monotone Column B (clue 1) now requires B₂ = 12 and B₃ = 13.

1. Recognise the required structure of the tree (2 grandparents → 3 married children → 6 grandchildren) and see that the 14 provided names exactly fill those 14 positions.  (R)  

2. Note that clue 3 speaks of “Neil’s son,” so Neil must be the male grand­parent and Katherine the female grand­parent.  (R)  

3. From clue 3 (“Tammy’s brother-in-law is Neil’s son”) conclude that Tammy is married to one of Neil & Katherine’s sons and that those parents therefore have at least two sons.  (C)  

4. Use clue 5 (“Ashley’s uncle, Steve, is Erin’s brother-in-law”) to decide that  
   • Steve himself is one of Neil & Katherine’s sons (he is an uncle) and  
   • Erin must be married to another of their sons (Steve’s brother).  (C)  

5. Apply clue 6 (“The three uncles are Payton’s dad, Cristian, and Katherine’s son”) to see that the only possible uncles/sons are three distinct men: Cristian, Payton’s dad, and (because any son is automatically “Katherine’s son”) Steve. Hence Cristian and Steve are sons, and Payton’s dad is a third, still unnamed, son.  (C)  

6. Consult the remaining male grandchild–age names; the only male not yet placed among the grandparents’ sons is Jason, so Jason must be Payton’s dad. Therefore Jason is the third son.  (C)  

7. Use clue 8 (“Jason’s brother is Ashley’s dad”) together with step 6 to decide that Ashley’s dad is Jason’s brother Cristian (Steve is already known to be Ashley’s uncle). Thus Cristian is Ashley’s father.  (C)  

8. Fix the three wives.  
   • Erin is already known to be Cristian’s wife (step 4).  
   • Tammy, by step 3, is Steve’s wife.  
   • The only adult woman still unassigned is Beth, so Beth is Jason’s wife.  (R)  

9. Distribute the six grandchildren, respecting genders and the remaining clues.  
   • Cristian + Erin → Ashley & Amanda (fits clue 9).  
   • Jason + Beth → Payton & Cole (fits clues 1, 6, 10).  
   • Steve + Tammy → Makayla & Kaitlyn (fits clues 1, 2, 4).  (R)

1. (Rudimentary) Translate the problem statement into two concrete rules:  
   • Each row and column must contain the four digits 1, 2, 3, 4 exactly once (Latin-square rule).  
   • Any digit may be followed by 0, 1, or 2 zeros, so every entry is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200, 300, 400.  

2. (Creative) Observe that the magnitudes of the given row sums (640, 442, 55, 442) immediately dictate where the “hundreds” must go:  
   • The only way to reach 640 is to have 400 + 200 in that row.  
   • Both 442 rows must each contain exactly one 400.  
   • The 55 row cannot contain any hundreds at all.  

3. (Creative) Perform the same magnitude check on the column sums (316, 433, 280, 550):  
   • Column D, totalling 550, must include a 400.  
   • Column B, totalling 433, must also include a 400.  
   • No other column total is high enough to need a 400.  
   • These two 400’s must come from two different rows because of the Latin-square rule; combine this with Step 2 to decide which rows get them.  

4. (Creative) Place the two 400’s uniquely:  
   • Put 400 in Row 1, Column B to satisfy Column B’s need for 400 and help Row 1 reach 640.  
   • Put 400 in Row 4, Column D to satisfy Column D’s need for 400 and give Row 4 its required 400.  

5. (Creative) Locate the remaining hundreds (a single 200) using the updated row and column deficits:  
   • Row 1 still needs 240 more, Column C needs 280, and Column A needs 316.

4. Examine Howard’s remaining claims.

That forces Howard himself to be one of the two students who have the chemistry-and-biology pair.  ‒ Creative  

5. Because two students share the chemistry-and-biology pair and Howard is already one of them, choose Edward as the second.

89,"Mary Beem, who was a wife, mother of four and grandmother of nine, was shot to death by an angry relative. Find out the name of the relative it was by piecing together the relationships of each person with the clues below.
The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.

From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Combine clues 5 and 6: because no Monet or Degas (clue 5) and no Sisley (clue 6) are allowed in the kitchen, every kitchen print must be Pissaro.  Let K be the number of kitchen prints; then clue 5 gives the equation  Total Monet (M) = Total Degas (G) + K.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Introduce room–total variables: Kitchen = Parlor = K (clue 1), Bedroom = B, Dining = Dn, Den = De; each room has ≥2 prints and all five totals sum to 18.  

3. (Creative)  Use clue 2: the den contains no Degas or Sisley, so its prints are restricted to Monet and/or Pissaro.  

4. (Creative)  Translate clue 3 into an equation for the whole collection: Total Sisley (S) = G + De (the number of Degas prints plus the total number of den prints).  

5. (Creative)  Interpret clue 4:  
   • Exactly one room holds three Sisley prints and has more prints than the parlor.  
   • Exactly one room holds two Degas prints and has fewer prints than the parlor.  
   Because the parlor itself must have fewer prints than the 3-Sisley room, the parlor cannot be that room; because the den has no Degas, the 2-Degas room must be somewhere else.  

6. (Creative)  Since the den cannot house any Degas and the kitchen/parlor share the same size and the kitchen has no Degas, the only room left that can be the unique “two Degas” room is the dining room → Dining gets exactly 2 Degas.  Consequently the “three Sisley” room must be the bedroom.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Place the 3 Sisley prints in the bedroom (as just determined).  By clue 2 the dining room needs at least 1 Pissaro, so add 1 Pissaro to the two Degas already there.  

8. (Rudimentary)  Apply the inequalities in clue 4.  The dining room currently has 3 prints, so the parlor must have more than 3, while the bedroom (with its 3 Sisley already) must end with more than the parlor.  Choosing K = 4 satisfies both conditions: Kitchen = Parlor = 4.  

9. (Rudimentary)  Fill the kitchen with its four mandatory Pissaro prints (Step 1).  

10. (Rudimentary)  The parlor also contains exactly 4 prints but may not contain Degas (clue 5).  Reserve an unknown number m of Monet prints for the parlor and keep the remaining 4 – m spots for Pissaro or Sisley.  

11. (Rudimentary)  Use the second part of clue 1: the bedroom must contain the same number of Monet prints as the parlor.  The workable value is m = 2.  Put 2 Monet in the parlor and 2 Monet in the bedroom.  

12. (Rudimentary)  Complete the parlor’s four-print quota with 1 Pissaro and 1 Sisley.  The bedroom now has 3 Sisley + 2 Monet = 5 prints, keeping it larger than the parlor as required.  

13. (Rudimentary)  Only the den remains.  To satisfy  S = G + De  (Step 4) and  M = G + K  (Step 1) while keeping every artist’s total ≤6, place 2 Monet in the den.  The final distribution is  

   • Kitchen: 4 Pissaro  
   • Parlor: 2 Monet, 1 Pissaro, 1 Sisley  
   • Bedroom: 2 Monet, 3 Sisley

(Creative)  Interpret clue 4:  \n   • Exactly one room holds three Sisley prints and has more prints than the parlor.  \n   • Exactly one room holds two Degas prints and has fewer prints than the parlor.  \n   Because the parlor itself must have fewer prints than the 3-Sisley room, the parlor cannot be that room; because the den has no Degas, the 2-Degas room must be somewhere else.  \n\n6. (Creative)  Since the den cannot house any Degas and the kitchen/parlor share the same size and the kitchen has no Degas, the only room left that can be the unique “two Degas” room is the dining room → Dining gets exactly 2 Degas.  Consequently the “three Sisley” room must be the bedroom.  \n\n7. (Rudimentary)  Place the 3 Sisley prints in the bedroom (as just determined).  By clue 2 the dining room needs at least 1 Pissaro, so add 1 Pissaro to the two Degas already there.  \n\n8. (Rudimentary)  Apply the inequalities in clue 4.  The dining room currently has 3 prints, so the parlor must have more than 3, while the bedroom (with its 3 Sisley already) must end with more than the parlor.  Choosing K = 4 satisfies both conditions: Kitchen = Parlor = 4.  \n\n9. (Rudimentary)  Fill the kitchen with its four mandatory Pissaro prints (Step 1).  \n\n10. (Rudimentary)  The parlor also contains exactly 4 prints but may not contain Degas (clue 5).  Reserve an unknown number m of Monet prints for the parlor and keep the remaining 4 – m spots for Pissaro or Sisley.  \n\n11. (Rudimentary)  Use the second part of clue 1: the bedroom must contain the same number of Monet prints as the parlor.  The workable value is m = 2.  Put 2 Monet in the parlor and 2 Monet in the bedroom.  \n\n12. (Rudimentary)  Complete the parlor’s four-print quota with 1 Pissaro and 1 Sisley.  The bedroom now has 3 Sisley + 2 Monet = 5 prints, keeping it larger than the parlor as required.  \n\n13. (Rudimentary)  Only the den remains.  To satisfy  S = G + De  (Step 4) and  M = G + K  (Step 1) while keeping every artist’s total ≤6, place 2 Monet in the den.  The final distribution is  \n\n   • Kitchen: 4 Pissaro  \n   • Parlor: 2 Monet, 1 Pissaro, 1 Sisley  \n   • Bedroom: 2 Monet, 3 Sisley  \n   • Dining: 2 Degas, 1 Pissaro  \n   • Den: 2 Monet  \n\n   Totals by artist: Degas 2, Monet 6, Pissaro 6, Sisley 4; totals by room: 4 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 18.

1. Read clues #3 and #4 to establish the two “paired” squares: B = L and C = M (each pair must contain the same mammal, with C/M explicitly not a beaver).  – Rudimentary  

2. Combine the “goat-locations” clue (#7) with the fact that B = L and C = M.  Because the two goats must appear in two different members of {B,C,K,O} and B/L as well as C/M are duplicates, the only way to get exactly two goats there is to put them at K and O.  – Creative  

3. Apply clue #2 (E and O differ, one is a horse).  Since O is a goat, E must be the horse.  – Rudimentary  

4. Use clue #8 (lions are in two of A,E,F,M).  With E already fixed as horse, the two lions must be A and F.  – Rudimentary  

5. Invoke clue #1 (A and D differ, one is a dog).  A is a lion, so D must be the dog.  – Rudimentary  

6. Determine what C and M are.  They are (i) the same, (ii) not beavers (#4), (iii) cannot be cats because C is next to the dog in D (#9), and (iv) cannot be tigers because that would force impossible goat adjacency at both squares (#10).  The only remaining species is walrus, so C and M are walruses.  – Creative  

7. Satisfy clue #11 (all beavers and walruses form one connected cluster).  With walruses now at C and M, the only plausible adjacent squares that can link them into one component are G and J, so G and J are set as the two beavers.  – Creative  

8. From clue #3 we already know B = L and “not tiger”; since tiger, goat, beaver, walrus, horse, lion, and dog are now all accounted for or ruled out, B and L must be the two cats.  – Rudimentary  

9. Enforce clue #6 (tigers in different columns).  With no tiger yet in column 2 or 3 and placement possibilities shrinking, choose N (column 2) as a tiger.  – Rudimentary  

10. Apply the cat-versus-dog restriction (#9).  Because cats sit at B and L, any dog in H or P would touch a cat; thus the second dog cannot be H or P, leaving I as the only legal square for the second dog.  – Creative

From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.

5. Translate clue 5: discover Mr. Smith neither won largest-fish nor used spinner bait, while the largest-fish category was won with spinner bait.  
6. Combine earlier facts: because Vick and Sam have no spinner bait they cannot be the largest-fish winner; because the weighted jig never wins, Mike (who does win) cannot be the jig user.  
7. Use clue 6: Mr. Jones wins most-fish and uses neither spinner nor deep crank; thus Black must be the spinner user and largest-fish winner, making Kevin the only possible Mr. Black.  
8. Apply clue 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and uses no deep crank, so deep-running crank must belong to Mr. Smith; Terry doesn’t use the worm, hence Vick uses the worm and Sam uses the weighted jig (with no category win).  
9. Notice that the plastic worm must belong to McNess or Jones; since Vick is not McNess, Vick must be Mr. Jones.

6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.

7:30, Brandon Jaspersen, Corte Madera, Bungee jumper
7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.
Since Cathy is from Berkeley, Alice cannot be from Daly City (5), and is therefore from Palo Alto. Likewise, Kreiger, who must be from Daly City, cannot be Francine, and must be named Evan. This leaves Francine at 8:00.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 19

1. (Rudimentary) Apply clue 10 to place the hypnotherapist at 7:15.  
2. (Rudimentary) From clue 8 observe that Jaspersen’s segment occurs 45 minutes after the beekeeper’s, so Jaspersen must be in the second half of the show (7:30, 7:45 or 8:00).  
3. (Rudimentary) Since the beekeeper precedes Jaspersen by 45 minutes, the beekeeper must be in the first half, and can only be at 6:45 or 7:00.  
4. (Rudimentary) Use clue 3 (Krieger at 7:45). Because Jaspersen is in the second half but not 7:45, Jaspersen must be at 7:30.  
5. (Rudimentary) Consequently, the beekeeper is fixed at 6:45.  
6. (Rudimentary) Clue 1 says the first three guests include the antique-car collector. With 6:45 (beekeeper) and 7:15 (hypnotherapist) already taken, the antique-car collector must be at 7:00.  
7. (Rudimentary) From clue 7 the financial adviser’s surname is Lautremont or Novak. Because Jaspersen (7:30) and Krieger (7:45) are ruled out, the only remaining open time is 8:00, so the financial adviser is scheduled then.  
8. (Creative) Clue 7 also forbids Morley from being the financial adviser and clue 4 forbids Morley from the first two slots; therefore Morley must be at 7:15.  
9. (Creative) With Morley now at 7:15, apply clue 4 (“Alice after Oakland and before Morley”): Alice’s slot is 7:00 and the Oakland guest is at 6:45.  
10. (Creative) Using clue 1 again (first-three-guest set contains Ivens and Berkeley), and knowing 7:00 is now taken by the antique-car collector, deduce that Ivens is the 6:45 guest and Berkeley is the 7:15 guest.  
11. (Rudimentary) Clue 6 lists the six special identifiers; eliminating those already placed shows the 6:45 and 7:15 guests must be Cathy and Damien (order still unknown).  
12. (Creative) Apply clue 9 (“crepe chef before Sausalito and after Brandon”): The only way to fit the open slots is Brandon at 7:30, the crepe chef at 7:45, and Sausalito at 8:00.  
13. (Rudimentary) The bungee jumper, now tied to 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto (clue 6), so must be from Corte Madera.  
14. (Rudimentary) Alice (7:00) must therefore be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, and so cannot have the surname Novak (clue 6).  
15. (Rudimentary) Hence Lautremont is the surname in the 7:00 slot (Alice), and Novak is assigned to the remaining 8:00 slot.  
16. (Rudimentary) Using clue 2 (Damien before Lautremont), conclude Damien is the 6:45 guest, leaving Cathy at 7:15.  
17. (Creative) Because Cathy (Berkeley) is female, and clue 5 requires Berkeley and Daly City guests to be of opposite sex, Alice cannot be from Daly City; therefore Alice must be from Palo Alto.  
18. (Rudimentary) Daly City remains unassigned; it therefore belongs to Krieger (7:45). Since Krieger is already known not to be Francine, his first name must be Evan.

1. Creative – Recognize the governing constraint: in every word each of the four letters must come from a different cube, because a single cube can show only one face at a time.  
2. Rudimentary – Note that a cube has six faces, so exactly 24 letter-faces are available in total; list the distinct letters occurring in the 15 given words and see that there are 24 of them, so every distinct letter must occupy exactly one face.  
3. Creative – Translate the problem into a graph-colouring task: make one node for every distinct letter and connect two nodes if the corresponding letters appear together in any word; then try to colour the graph with four colours so that no word contains two letters of the same colour and no colour class exceeds six letters (the six faces of a cube).  
4. Rudimentary – Build the adjacency graph from the word list (either by hand or with a program) to obtain the full set of incompatibility edges.  
5. Creative – Use a colouring strategy: start with the most highly connected letters (those appearing with many others) and place them on different cubes first, then continue greedily while keeping the “≤ 6 letters per colour” restriction in mind.  
6. Rudimentary – Continue assigning the remaining, less-connected letters one by one, backtracking if a placement later proves impossible, until all 24 letters are successfully coloured with four colours that respect the size limit.  
7. Rudimentary – Translate each colour class into the corresponding cube, writing down the six letters that end up on each cube.  
8. Rudimentary – Double-check that every listed word can indeed be produced by choosing one letter from each of the four resulting cubes; after verification, record the final cube layouts:

106,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)

(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

1. Deduce from Manny’s remark that Manny’s number has to be odd; only then can he be certain Moe and Jack cannot share the same value (because 14 – odd is odd, which cannot be split into two identical integers).  
2. Note that if Moe’s number were 7, 9, or 11 he would already have known, even before Manny spoke, that all three numbers are different, contradicting the story; therefore eliminate 7, 9, 11 for Moe.  
3. Observe that if Moe held 1, 3, or 5, Manny’s number could equal Moe’s (both odd), so Moe still could not be sure the numbers were all different; eliminate 1, 3, 5.  
4. See that with Moe holding 4, 8, or 12, there are still odd pairs for Manny and Jack that sum to the necessary remainder, so Moe could not guarantee Manny and Jack differ; eliminate 4, 8, 12.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Translate the “complete 8-person loop” into an alternating sequence of four men and four women:  
   M1 → G1 → M2 → G2 → M3 → G3 → M4 → G4 → (back to M1).  
   This structural model makes every later placement a matter of filling slots.

2. (Creative)  Exploit rotational symmetry by fixing Peter in the first male position, M1.  
   Because the loop can be rotated without changing the logic, anchoring Peter removes redundant cases.

3. (Creative)  Apply “Joseph loves a girl who loves the man who loves Elaine.”  
   That forces Elaine to be exactly two persons after Joseph in the loop, giving two possible orderings:  
   A) Peter → G1 → Albert → G2 → Joseph → G3 → M4 → Elaine → …  
   B) Peter → Elaine → Albert → G2 → M3 → G3 → Joseph → G4 → …

4. (Rudimentary)  Observe that the still-unnamed male in each partial chain must be Paolo (the only remaining man).  
   Insert Paolo accordingly in both cases.

5. (Rudimentary)  Use “Liza is loved by the guy who is loved by the girl who is loved by Paolo.”  
   That places Liza two persons after Paolo in each tentative chain, updating both A and B.

6. (Rudimentary)  Apply “Linda hates Paolo,” which rules out Linda being the woman who loves Paolo.  
   This fixes Linda’s slot in each chain (G2 in A, G3 in B).

7. (Rudimentary)  The only woman not yet named in either chain is Amy, so fill the remaining female slot with Amy.

8. (Rudimentary)  Check the final condition: “Linda is hated by the man whom Amy loves.”  
   Only chain A satisfies this; chain B violates it.

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  
Creative Steps: 3  
Rudimentary Steps: 4  

Steps:  
1. The dog evaluates the “do-not-eat” option: if it leaves the flower alone there is a 50 % chance it will die from the virus. (Rudimentary)  

2. The dog realises that, because it can never observe whether the flower is poisoned, its own choice (eat vs. not-eat) cannot be conditioned on the flower’s actual decision; therefore, from the dog’s point of view, its action is independent of whatever the flower does. (Creative)  

3. The flower, knowing the dog’s limitation, recognises the same independence: it understands that whether or not it manufactures poison will have no influence on the dog’s eventual action. (Creative)  

4. Because manufacturing poison is costly and does not affect the dog’s behaviour, the flower’s best (rational) response is to refrain from producing poison. (Creative)

FACTS
1, There are total of 15 balls.
2, For each ball potted, the player will receive one point.
3, They all will play each other once.
4, A game will end when all the balls are potted.
5, The winner will be the player who scored the most points.
OUTCOMES
1, Hayden Seek finished with 18 points.
2, Al Gore-Rhythm finished with odd number of points.
3, Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points in the match between them.
4, There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm.
5, Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game.
6, Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff.
7, Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome.
Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5
Hayden Seek 4 and Al Gore-Rhythm 11
Al Gore-Rhythm 10 and Dan Druff 5
Annie Buddyhome 6 and Hayden Seek 9
Al Gore-Rhythm 11+10+8= 29 points (odd)
Annie Buddyhome 8+7+6=21 points
Hayden Seek 5+4+9=18 points (given)
Dan Druff 7+10+5=22 points

2. Use clue 4 to strike out every non-prime number from Row 5.  
3. Exploit the “one triangular number per column” rule (clue 14) to place 55 in column G and 66 in column O, since these are the only triangular numbers available for those columns.  
4. Apply clue 7 to recognise that column O must consist of the equally-spaced sequence 63-64-65-66-67 from top to bottom.  
5. With O3 now fixed at 65, use clue 8 (B3 × O3 between 600 and 700) to deduce B3 = 10 (because 10 × 65 = 650).  
6. Still using clue 14, delete the other triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 15 from column B so that it retains only a single triangular entry.  
7. Invoke the column-B sum requirement of 60 (clue 5) to rule out any remaining numbers below 10 in that column.  
8. Apply the midpoint relations in clue 12 to discard combinations that violate the required averages.  
9. Use the “exactly one multiple of 11 per row and column” rule (clue 13) to force G1 = 55; this in turn makes B1 = 13 and B5 = 11.  
10. Combine clues 1, 6, 9, 13 and 14 to settle column I: I1 = 21 (greater than 19 but still satisfying the 11-divisibility rule’s distribution) and I3 = 22, with the other I-entries adjusted accordingly.  
11. From clue 12, set N1 = 31 and G3 = 47 because 31 is midway between I4 and G4, while 47 is midway between N1 and O1.  
12. Use clue 13 again to put the remaining multiple of 11 in column N, giving N2 = 44.  
13. Apply the cross-sum equality of clue 9 to obtain I5 = 19 and G5 = 53.  
14. With the first midpoint condition of clue 10 and the numbers already fixed, deduce I4 = 16 and N4 = 46, which leaves I2 = 18.  
15. Invoke the second midpoint condition (clue 11) to fix N5 = 37 and G2 = 56.  
16.

124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

1. (Creative) Observe that the cube ends with both gray (black + white) and dark-blue (black + blue) regions.  Therefore black must have been applied after both white and blue, so black cannot be first and neither white nor blue can be last.  

2. (Creative) Note that if red had been on the front face before black was applied, the front would now show maroon (red + black).  Since the final front is black with a gray circle, black must have been applied before red; hence black is not last and red is not first.  

3. (Rudimentary) Because white, blue, and black have been ruled out as “last,” the only remaining color that can be last is red.  

4. (Rudimentary) To satisfy “after both white and blue” and “before red,” black must occupy the third position, leaving only the first two positions for white and blue.  

5. (Rudimentary) Evaluate the four given exclusive statements.  With red last, statement 4 (“White was added last”) is false; with black not first, statement 1 is false; with red not before blue, statement 2 is false.

125,"For a TV entertainment show on Madadian TV entitled ""I am a Celebrity, get me a Kebab!!"" the producer, Mad Ade (no relation) must choose a group of two Directors and two Musicians. At least one of them must be an Actor and at least one a Singer.
Available Directors are Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh and Zoltan Pepper.
Available Musicians are Howard Eyeno, Eve O'Looshun, Di O'Bolic and Brighton Early.
Ty Tanick, Howard Eyeno and Eve O'Looshun are Actors.
Winnie DePooh and Brighton Early are Singers.
Howard Eyeno will not sit in the same room with Ty Tanick, and will take part only if Holly Wood is there.
Winnie DePooh refuses to take part with Eve O'Looshun.
Zoltan Pepper refuses to take part with Brighton Early.
How many acceptable groups can the producer put together?",,"There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians. However, some of them are not acceptable, because they do not include both an actor and a singer. This brings the possible combinations down to 36. When you eliminate the combinations that represent people who refuse to work together, you end up with 9.The acceptable groups are:
1) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Howard Eyeno, and Brighton Early;
2) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Eve O'Looshun, and Brighton Early;
3) Holly Wood, Ty Tanick, Eve O'Looshun, and Brighton Early;

8) Jed I. Knight, Ty Tanick, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early;
9) Ty Tanick, Winnie DePooh, Di O'Bolic, and Brighton Early.
Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else. Winnie DePooh doesn't get a similar advantage by being the only director/singer because he refuses to work with Eve O'Looshun, which limits his availability.

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:
A-V
B-W
C-Q
D-M
E-K
F-U
G-N
H-P
I-O
J-R
L-X
S-T

""These thirteen pairs consist of all 26 letters of the alphabet,"" said the troll. ""The password contains thirteen letters, no two of which are the same. Each pair consists of one letter that is in the password and one other letter. If you wrote out the ""other"" letters in alphabetical order and then wrote each ""password"" letter under each one's corresponding ""other"" letter, you would have the correct spelling of the password.""
Then the troll wrote five short words on the rock: FACE, QUEST, QUICK, SWITCH, and WORLD. ""Each short word contains exactly the same number of letters with the password,"" he said.
So, what is the password?",Q cannot exist in the password without U.,"The password is UNPREDICTABLY.
Exactly one of S and T must be in the password. So QUEST, and so each word, must have at least one letter in common with the password.
Suppose each word has one common letter . Then none of Q, U, and E can be in the word, so C, F, and K must be in the word. But now FACE has at least two letters in common.
Suppose each word has two common letters. The second common letter in QUEST cannot be Q. Suppose it is U. Then C and K must be in the password and F cannot. But now QUICK has at least three common letters.
Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.
Like QUEST, SWITCH contains both S and T. I and C are in the password, so W and H cannot. Since neither W nor O can be in the password, the three common letters in WORLD must be R, L, and D, so J, X, and M cannot.

Steps:  
1. [Creative]  Notice that the pair S-T contains both S and T, so exactly one of those two letters must be in the password.  Because QUEST contains both S and T while every listed word is said to share the same number of letters with the password, each word must share at least one letter with the password.  

2. [Creative]  Assume each short word shares exactly one letter with the password.  Under that assumption Q, U, E cannot be shared with QUEST, forcing C, F, K to be shared instead; this gives FACE at least two shared letters, contradicting the assumption.  Therefore one shared letter is impossible.  

3. [Creative]  Assume each word shares exactly two letters with the password.  The second shared letter in QUEST cannot be Q, so test U: that puts C and K in the password and excludes F, giving QUICK at least three shared letters—contradiction.  Testing E instead gives FACE at least three shared letters—again a contradiction.  Hence two shared letters are impossible.  

4. [Creative]  Assume each word shares exactly four letters with the password.  Then Q, U, E would all have to be in the password and C, F, K all out, leaving FACE with at most two letters in common—a contradiction.  Thus four shared letters are impossible.  

5. [Creative]  By elimination, every short word must share exactly three letters with the password.  

6. [Creative]  Determine which three letters QUEST shares.  They cannot be S/T + Q + E (or Q + U) because each such choice violates the “three letters for FACE or QUICK” condition.  The only viable trio is S/T together with U and E; hence Q is not in the password.  

7. [Creative]  Because Q is the “other” letter in pair C-Q, C must be the password letter, while F and K (from pairs F-U and E-K) cannot be in the password.  

8. [Creative]  FACE now must share A as its third common letter, making V (pair A-V) an “other” letter.  QUICK must share I as its third common letter, making O (pair I-O) an “other” letter.  

9. [Creative]  SWITCH, like QUEST, contains both S and T.  With I and C already confirmed in the password, W and H must be “other” letters.  Since neither W nor O can be in the password, WORLD’s three shared letters must be R, L, D, forcing J, X, M to be “other” letters.

128,"The rugby season may be over, but the wheeling and dealing is just reaching a high point. Recently, each of six teams acquired a different, valuable, player to beef up its roster. Each player specializes in a different position (one is a prop), and, coincidentally enough, each was acquired from a different one of the other teams. Each felt a pang of regret at leaving his former team, but is eagerly awaiting the first scrum of the season with his new mates. From the following clues, can you match each player with his position, new team and former team?
1. The one from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets.
2. The Mountaineers, Troopers and Typhoons signed the fullback, the player who left the Downers and Cowan, in some order.
3. The Downers, Scarlets and Jets lost Tuitupou, the center and the player who signed with the Typhoons, in some order.

7. The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker last week.
8. Rokocoko isn't the fullback.
9. The wing's wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets.
10. Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets.
11. The fly half, who isn't going to the Mountaineers, isn't Cowan.",,"The player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets (clue 6). This player is either Rokocoko or McGuyver (clue 5); the other left the Mountaineers.
A third player is the hooker, who left the Downers (clue 7).
The wing signed with the Scarlets. Since the player from the Mountaineers didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 1), this is a fourth player.
Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.
The center didn't leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers (clue 3), so he is the 6th player, leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver as the fullback and the fly half, in some order.
At this point we know the following information about the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) the hooker, left the Downers
4) the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) the center
Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.

Steps:  
1. From clue 6 note that “the player who left the Troopers signed with the Jets.” Combine this with clue 5 (“Rokocoko and McGuyver left the Mountaineers and the Troopers, in some order”) to conclude that one of them left the Troopers for the Jets and the other left the Mountaineers. (Rudimentary)  

2. Take clue 7 (“The hooker cleared his stuff out of his former Downer locker”) to establish a third, separate player: the hooker left the Downers. (Rudimentary)

3. Use clue 9 (“The wing’s wife was delighted that her husband signed with the Scarlets”) together with clue 1 (“The one from the Mountaineers didn’t sign with the Scarlets”) to decide the wing, who signed with the Scarlets, is a fourth distinct player who did not come from the Mountaineers. (Rudimentary)

4. Apply clue 2 to see that Cowan is neither “the player who left the Downers” nor “the wing who signed with the Scarlets,” so Cowan must be a fifth different player. (Rudimentary)

5. Employ clue 2 again and clue 11 to rule out Cowan as fullback or fly-half. (Rudimentary)

6. Combine clues 3 and 4: the center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), therefore the center signed with the Downers and Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). Because Cowan isn’t the center (clue 2), Cowan must be the prop. (Rudimentary)

7. From clue 3 the center didn’t leave the Troopers or the Mountaineers, making him the sixth unique player and leaving Rokocoko and McGuyver to be the fullback and fly-half (order unknown). (Rudimentary)

8. Use clue 2 again: Jeeper (just placed with the Typhoons) must be one of the trio in that clue. Since he isn’t Cowan and cannot be the fullback, he must be the hooker who left the Downers. (Rudimentary)

9. By clue 10 Grippley did not sign with the Scarlets, so he cannot be the wing; he must therefore be the center, which leaves Tuitupou as the wing. (Rudimentary)

10. Recognize that the person who left the Mountaineers obviously didn’t sign with the Mountaineers; thus Cowan (already known to be the prop) must have signed with the Mountaineers, and whoever left the Mountaineers must have signed with the Troopers. (Rudimentary)

11. From clue 2 the fullback did not sign with the Jets, so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly-half signed with the Jets. (Rudimentary)

12. Apply clue 8 (“Rokocoko isn’t the fullback”) to settle that McGuyver is the fullback (Troopers) and Rokocoko is the fly-half (Jets). (Rudimentary)

13. Consult clue 3 again: Tuitupou must have left either the Downers, Scarlets, or Jets. Because Jeeper left the Downers and Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets. (Rudimentary)

14. With Tuitupou leaving the Jets, clue 3 forces the Scarlets to have lost the center (Grippley). (Rudimentary)

15. By elimination, the only team Cowan could have left is the Typhoons. All roles, new teams, and former teams are now fixed, giving the final listing:
   • Rokocoko – fly-half – from Troopers → Jets  
   • McGuyver – fullback – from Mountaineers → Troopers

Combine clues 3 and 4: the center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), therefore the center signed with the Downers and Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). Because Cowan isn’t the center (clue 2), Cowan must be the prop. (Rudimentary)\n\n7.

Since he isn’t Cowan and cannot be the fullback, he must be the hooker who left the Downers. (Rudimentary)\n\n9. By clue 10 Grippley did not sign with the Scarlets, so he cannot be the wing; he must therefore be the center, which leaves Tuitupou as the wing. (Rudimentary)\n\n10.

Consult clue 3 again: Tuitupou must have left either the Downers, Scarlets, or Jets. Because Jeeper left the Downers and Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.

1. Use “Liz walked twice as far as the girl who saw the deer” together with the available distances {3,4,5,6,7}.  Because only 6 km is double an available distance (3 km), conclude Liz = 6 km and the deer photographer = 3 km. *(Creative)*  

2. Apply “The girl who got a shot of the fox travelled one kilometre less than Jenny.”  Among the remaining distances {4,5,7}, only the ordered pair (4,5) fits a one-kilometre gap, so Jenny = 5 km and the fox photographer = 4 km. *(Creative)*  

3. Combine “The girl in the bushes was not the one who walked 5 km” with “The girl on the riverside walked either one kilometre more or less than the one who was in the bushes.”  
   – 5 km is disqualified for bushes.  
   – 6 km(±1) gives 5 km or 7 km as the partner value; 5 km is taken (Jenny), so pair (6 km, 7 km) must be (riverside, bushes) or (bushes, riverside).  
   – Because 7 km cannot be riverside (it would force bushes = 6 km, violating “bushes ≠ 5 km” relation), set riverside = 6 km (Liz) and bushes = 7 km. *(Creative)*  

4. Exploit “The girl who captured the rabbit walked farther than Marge, but not as far as the one who got the bear cubs.”  
   – 7 km is the only distance longer than Liz’s 6 km, so bear cubs = 7 km (already bushes).  
   – Marge therefore must be below 6 km, and the rabbit photographer must be 6 km.  
   – Thus Liz (6 km) photographed the rabbit; Marge’s distance becomes 4 km. *(Creative)*  

5. Use the mountain clues:  
   “The girl who hiked up the mountain walked farther than at least one other girl but not the farthest” and “The mountain climber walked either one kilometre more or less than Marge.”  
   – Marge is 4 km, so the mountain distance is 3 km or 5 km.  
   – 3 km is already the minimum, violating ‘not the farthest but farther than at least one,’ so mountain = 5 km (therefore Jenny = mountain). *(Creative)*  

6. Bring in “Sam did not get a picture of the bird” together with unassigned animals.  Since Jenny (5 km, mountain) still lacks an animal and bird has no conflicts with her clues, assign bird to Jenny; Sam therefore cannot have bird. *(Rudimentary)*  

7. Apply the meadow clues:  
   “The meadow explorer was not the one to take a picture of the bird” and “The girl in the meadow walked one kilometre more or less than the mountain climber.”  
   – Mountain = 5 km, so meadow is 4 km or 6 km.  
   – 6 km is Liz on the riverside, leaving 4 km.  
   – 4 km matches Marge (not bird), so Marge = meadow. *(Creative)*  

8. Use “The bear cubs and the fox were not captured in the forest.”

134,"Madadia is split, like other countries, into cities, towns and villages. Some are large and some are small. Postman Patel delivers the mail in the village of ""Lardville"".
Now Lardville is so small there is only one street with only ten houses, numbered from 1 to 10.
In a certain week, Patel did not deliver any mail at two houses in the village; at the other houses he delivered mail three times each. Each working day he delivered mail at exactly four houses.
The sums of the house numbers where he delivered mail were:
on Monday: 18
on Tuesday: 12
on Wednesday: 23
on Thursday: 19
on Friday: 32
on Saturday: 25
on Sunday: he never works just in case any murder suspects try to use this as an excuse.
Can you work out which two houses received no mail this week?",,"If postman Patel would have delivered mail three times at each house, then the total sum of the house numbers per day would be (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)x3=165. Now that sum is 18+12+23+19+32+25=129. The difference is 165-129=36; divided by 3 this is 12. The sum of the house numbers where no mail was delivered is therefore 12. The following combinations are possible:
2+10
3+9
4+8
5+7
Each day at four houses the mail was delivered. On Tuesday the sum was 12. 12 can only be made from four house numbers in 2 ways:
1+2+3+6
1+2+4+5
The same holds for Friday with the sum of 32:
5+8+9+10
6+7+9+10
From this we can conclude that the house numbers 1, 2, 9 and 10 for sure have received mail, which means that the combinations 2+10 and 3+9 are not possible. Also the combination 5+7 is not possible, because mail was delivered either at house 5 or at house 7.

Cleaning Days -- 	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Number of Messages -- 	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Rooms Cleaned -- 	Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen
Clues:
#1) Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.
#2) Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
#3) She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.

**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.

Chap 1 -- Des, Freud, I Kant, Jung, Sense
Chap 2 -- Des, Freud, I Kant, Jung, Sense, etc.
Cross off what you know is NOT the correct answer from the clues, and when you find a chapter number that fits a title, circle it, or write the information on the piece of paper in a different section to keep track.  Do the same with the other correlations that can be surmised by looking at the clues:
(Chapter Names) -- (Students Names)
(Student Names) -- (Chapter Numbers)
Keep in mind that for example, if you find a chapter number for a title, the other chapter numbers can NOT have that title, so that gives you another answer to mark off to narrow the correct answer down.","Answers:
Chapter 1 -- ""Jung At Heart"" -- Caleb
Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 12

Steps:  
1. Convert Clue 1 into the ordered block “Sense of Hume-or  →  Alex’s chapter  →  Descartes Before DesHorse,” and list the immediate corollaries (Sense cannot be chapter 5, Alex cannot be chapters 1 or 5, Descartes cannot be chapter 1, and Alex’s chapter is neither Sense nor Descartes).  

2. Convert Clue 2 into the restrictions “Jung At Heart occurs somewhere before Toby’s chapter,” “Toby is not chapter 1,” and “Jung is not chapter 5 (nor Toby’s own chapter).”  

3. Convert Clue 3 into the rule “Kiera’s chapter number = (Freudian Slippers’ chapter number) + 3,” which implies Freudian Slippers cannot be chapters 3, 4, 5 and Kiera cannot be chapters 1, 2, 3.  

4. Apply Clue 4: Joan is not chapter 4, and Joan’s chapter is consecutive with I Kant Understand It.  If Kant were chapter 5, Joan would have to be chapter 4 (impossible), so Kant is not chapter 5.  Because Sense is already barred from chapter 5 (step 1), Descartes must be chapter 5.  

5. Use the ordered block from step 1 with Descartes already fixed at chapter 5 to set Alex’s chapter at 4 and Sense of Hume-or at 3.  

6. Since Kiera cannot be chapters 1–3 (step 3) and Alex occupies chapter 4 (step 5), Kiera must be chapter 5 (therefore reading Descartes Before DesHorse).  

7. Kiera’s placement at chapter 5 forces Freudian Slippers to be three chapters earlier, i.e., chapter 2.  

8. Considering Clue 2 with the remaining open positions, Jung At Heart and Toby must occupy chapters 1 and 2 in that order; otherwise Jung would not precede Toby.  Therefore Jung At Heart is chapter 1.  

9. With chapters 1, 2, 3, 5 already titled, the lone remaining title, I Kant Understand It, belongs to chapter 4 (Alex’s chapter).  

10. From Clue 4, Joan’s chapter must be consecutive with Kant.  Kant is chapter 4 and Joan cannot be chapter 4, so Joan must be chapter 3 (Sense of Hume-or).

147,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E

1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.

4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?",,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:

3. (R) Use clue 7 to fix the centre column: blue shirt, 31 years old, 42 trains.  
4. (C) Apply clue 1 (trains = planes – 44).  Of the plane totals given, only 86 produces an allowed train total (42), so Bob must have 86 planes and 42 trains.  
5. (R) Since 42 trains are already fixed in the centre column, place Bob in the centre with the blue shirt and age 31.  
6. (R) From clue 3, the far-right person is 8 years younger than Bob and has 174 planes ⇒ far-right age = 23.  
7. (R) From clue 4, Josh wears yellow and has 37 fewer trains than Bob (42 – 37 = 5).  Only the far-right column can take 5 trains, so place Josh on the far right with a yellow shirt, 174 planes and age 23.

9. (R) From clue 10, the orange-shirt 45-train person is next to the 31-year-old but not next to the 26-plane spotter; therefore the orange shirt must be in column 4.

11. (R) Identify the only plane total still compatible with Tom (not already taken): 123 planes.  
12. (R) Use clue 6 to place Steven with 105 trains and 250 planes; the only open column is column 2.  
13. (C) Apply clue 5: the green-shirt person is 19 years younger than the person to his left.  If Steven (column 2) wears green, the person to his left is Doug (column 1).  Choose Steven’s age 21 and Doug’s age 40 to satisfy 40 – 21 = 19.  
14. (R) Assign Steven the green shirt and age 21.

152,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

153,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.

Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.

154,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'

As I wanted to know the names of the respective owners of the books I asked them about the owners of the books. The following are the answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy.
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.

I knew that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.

Grobi:
1...is round in shape.
2...is six inches in diameter.
3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.

163,"Well... The Winning Combination is back.. but with a twist!  You are a millionaire... but you have now become very greedy and a cheater.  You spend lots of money on selfish things, and are finding yourself very short of money.  The show has refused to let you back on after you meanly insulted the host.
But you are sneakier than that.  Now, your son has applied to be a contestant and has successfully made it on.  He, however, has nowhere near the brain power as you, so you have figured out another device, being the greedy person you are, to help your son out and claim half a million more.
He is secretly wearing a very cleverly disguised earpiece which you will talk to him through.  Whilst you sit at home, with a pen and paper, he will recite the clues into your ear and you must solve them for him!
You grip your pen... with headphones and microphone in place, and wait for him to start reciting.
The combination is spaced out like this... ??-??-??-??.  A 'set' refers to a set of two numbers.
""OK, Dad...
1. The sum of the digits in the third set is less than 14 but greater than 10.
2. The third set of numbers is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
3. If you multiply the second set of numbers by 2 and add 7, then you will get the first set of numbers.
4. The sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.
5. There are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination.  Every other number is in the combination.
6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Use clue 2 and the given total of 28 ribbons to convert the fraction “one-quarter of the total” into the concrete value 7; conclude that Pretty in Pink won 7 ribbons in all and that Ravishing Red + Yummy Yellow + Simply Silver together also total 7 ribbons.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Introduce variables for the still-unknown totals of Ravishing Red, Yummy Yellow and Simply Silver (say r, y, s) with the equation r + y + s = 7, and variables m for Mrs. Thelma Thorne and v for Very Violet, remembering all six totals must sum to 28 and must be different.  

3. (Creative)  Combine the uniqueness requirement (clue 1) with the small integer possibilities that add to 7 to list the only feasible distinct triples (r, y, s) and, at the same time, note from clue 5 that Yummy Yellow already owns exactly one blue ribbon, forcing its total to be as small as possible; infer y = 1.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 6 (“Simply Silver won an equal number of blue and red ribbons”) to conclude that s must be an even number; with y = 1 and the need for distinct totals, take s = 2.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Use r + y + s = 7 to get r = 4 for Ravishing Red’s total.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Translate clue 3 (“Very Violet won the same number as Mrs. Thelma Thorne and Simply Silver together”) into the equation v = m + s; substitute s = 2 and 7 + (r=4) + (y=1) + s=2 + m + v = 28 to solve for the only pair of distinct integers that work, giving m = 6 and v = 8.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Convert each rose’s fractional colour information into equations:  
 • Ravishing Red: red = ¾·4 = 3, blue = 1.  
 • Mrs. Thelma Thorne: blue = ⅓·6 = 2, red = 4.  
 • Simply Silver: red = blue and total = 2 → 1 blue, 1 red.  
 • Yummy Yellow: “just one blue ribbon” implies 1 blue, 0 red.

165,"Biggie Nuff, Baron of Grey Matter, now living in Shapeless, Mass., was dying from a newly developed allergy to water, and wanted his will to reflect the common inheritance law of his father's native country.  Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.
In due time, Biggie died, and the authorities read his will, holding dispensation of the estate until the child was born.  Five months after Biggie's death, Faerie delivered ... normal, healthy twins, a boy (whom she named Manny) and a girl (whom she named Goodie).
The estate's executor immediately appealed to the Shapeless magistrate to rule on the proper division for the estate.  After a great deal of arguing and deep thought, plus several failed attempts to raise Biggie's spirit with a seance, the judge rendered a fair decision.
How did they divide Biggie's estate?",,"The judge reasoned that Biggie intended to give his wife half as much as a son, or twice as much as a daughter.  Therefore, he ruled that Manny gets 4/7 of the estate, Faerie gets 2/7, and Goodie gets 1/7.

166,"The American Jukebox Twist Contest has been the talk of local high schools for weeks, so it's no surprise that Arnold's Diner is jammed full with twisting teenagers hoping to take home the trophy.  The competition is going to be fierce, as eight pairs of champion twisters, each from a different school, have entered.  As the makeshift dance floor fills with poodle skirts and blue suede shoes, each couple was asked to request a different song to be played during the marathon, which is expected to last long into the night.  From the information provided, name the young man and young woman who make up each couple, determine the high school each pair attends and the song they requested.
You will need to draw out a rectangular 2 x 4 grid (A - D on top, E - H on bottom) with the center line representing a row of tables in order to help determine who was in what position on the dance floor.

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary)  Draw the 2 × 4 floor grid (A-D on the top row, E-H on the bottom row) so that “across” means directly over/under and “diagonally opposite” means A-H and D-E.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Enter the direct pairings from Clue 3:  
   • Donald’s couple → “The Peppermint Twist”  
   • Wendy’s couple  → “Twisting the Night Away”  
   • Cindy’s couple  → “Twistin’ USA” and Lincoln High  

3. (Creative)  Combine Clue 2 with what is now known about Cindy:  
   • The songs for C, F, H are “Twist and Shout,” “Dear Lady Twist,” and “Twistin’ USA.”  
   • Because Cindy already has “Twistin’ USA,” her couple must be in F.  
   • Hence “Twist and Shout” and “Dear Lady Twist” occupy C and H, and the Lakewood couple (the one that asked for “Twist and Shout”) is therefore in C.  

4. (Rudimentary)  From Clue 8, “Dear Lady Twist” belongs either to Nancy/Westerberg or to the Washington couple; therefore the couple in H (the one with “Dear Lady Twist”) is either Nancy/Westerberg or the Washington pair.  

5. (Creative)  Use Clue 6 (A-D-E-H must be Laverne, Jenny, Washington, and “Twist, Twist Senora”):  
   • H already has “Dear Lady Twist,” so it cannot be “Twist, Twist Senora.”  
   • Thus H must be the Washington couple (ruling out Nancy there).  

6. (Creative)  Apply Clue 8 again: Nancy/Westerberg must be directly across from Washington.  Across from H is D, so place Nancy and Westerberg High in D.  Because D must still satisfy Clue 6, assign the remaining special entry, “Twist, Twist Senora,” to D.  

7. (Creative)  Work with the four corner positions and Clue 5:  
   • Since H is Washington, Roosevelt must pair with Ricky on the opposite diagonal A-H, so Roosevelt High is at A and Ricky is the boy in H.  
   • The other diagonal (D-E) therefore contains Bill and the Jefferson couple.  Bill is made the boy in D (with Nancy), leaving Jefferson High for E.  

8. (Rudimentary)  Clue 8 also states that the couple in A requested “Let’s Twist Again,” so the Roosevelt pair in A gets that song.  

9. (Rudimentary)  From Clue 4, Curt & partner, the Roosevelt couple, and Sheryl & partner are on the same side of the tables.  Roosevelt is in A (top row), so Curt’s and Sheryl’s couples must also occupy top-row positions B, C, or D.  

10. (Creative)  Use Clue 7 (“Cindy is immediately next to, and due right of, Steve and his partner”): with Cindy fixed in F, Steve & partner must be in E.  Hence Steve is the boy in the Jefferson couple.  

11. (Rudimentary)  Finish Clue 6: among A, D, E, H we still need Laverne and Jenny.  Because H already has Veronica (with Ricky) and D has Nancy, place Laverne with Steve in E and Jenny with the boy in A.  

12. (Rudimentary)  Apply the name restrictions from Clue 1 (George isn’t with Wendy; Tony isn’t at Roosevelt) and the still-unassigned people to complete the pairings:  
    • B: Donald & Sheryl  
    • C: Curt & Laurie  
    • F: George & Cindy  
    • G: Tony & Wendy  

13. (Rudimentary)  Distribute the remaining songs:  
    • B gets “The Peppermint Twist” (Clue 3)  
    • G gets “Twisting the Night Away” (Clue 3)  
    • E gets the last unclaimed tune, “The Twist.”  

14. (Rudimentary)  Verify that every clue is satisfied (Sheryl not beside Nancy or Laverne, Tony not Roosevelt, George not with Wendy, etc.), yielding the final arrangement:  
    A  – Danny & Jenny – Roosevelt – “Let’s Twist Again”  
    B  – Donald & Sheryl – Riverdale – “The Peppermint Twist”

2. (Rudimentary) From the grid eliminations, deduce that Brian must be wearing the orange shorts.  
3. (Rudimentary) Note that once orange is taken, the only remaining color Brian could not take is blue, so Ethan must be the one in blue.  
4. (Rudimentary) Apply Clues 7 and 9 to see that Chuck’s color choices reduce to only orange or green.  
5. (Rudimentary) Apply Clue 12 to rule out orange for Chuck, forcing Chuck’s color to be green.  
6. (Rudimentary) With orange, blue and green assigned, the only consistent remaining assignments are David = red, Frank = violet, Alvin = yellow.  
7. (Rudimentary) Record the complete color assignment: Alvin = yellow, Brian = orange, Chuck = green, David = red, Ethan = blue, Frank = violet.  
8. (Creative) Decide to reconstruct the race by working backward through the position-changing clues, now substituting names for colors.  
9. (Rudimentary) Use Clue 15: “yellow (Alvin) beats orange (Brian) beats green (Chuck)” to derive their relative order near the finish.

The first and third statements are incompatible; they cannot of course both be true, and they can only be lies if on one of the days mentioned Steve tells the truth. But, they have no such day in common. Therefore one of them must be true, and the other must refer to that day. Looking at the second statement (which must be a lie, as there can at most be one true statement and we have one), the first day cannot be Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the first statement cannot be true, since the third cannot refer to it by day. Therefore, the third statement is true, and must (from the first statement) be a Monday or Tuesday. Statement two, however, rules out Monday, leaving only Tuesday as the 'day of truth'.

Hence they cannot both be true, and they cannot both be false unless Steve’s single truth-day appeared in both statements, which is impossible.

2. Because only one statement can be true and one of the edge statements already is, the middle (second) statement (“Today is either Sunday, Saturday or Thursday”) must be false.  (Rudimentary)  

3. From the falsity of the second statement, conclude that the second day is not Sunday, Saturday, or Thursday; therefore it must be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday. That in turn means the first day (one day earlier) cannot be Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday.  (Rudimentary)  

4.

Now, the total weight of all the wedges at the grocery divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so the ""Chillirella"" wedge must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.

3. (Rudimentary)  Apply the rule “A must be followed by B or E” to discard patterns (a) and (c) because in each of them A is followed immediately by F.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Use the rule “Only D can precede A” to modify the two patterns that still contain “_A_” in an incorrect position: convert (e) and (f) into DA_X_F and _F_XDA respectively by inserting D immediately before A.

Both of the clocks worked fairly well considering their age, but one clock gained ten seconds per hour while the other one lost ten seconds per hour. On a day in January, the two friends set both clocks correctly at 12:00 noon. ""Do you realize,"" asked Joe, ""that the next time both of our clocks will show exactly the same time will be on your 47th birthday?"" Smoe agreed.

On a calendar, there are 90 days between noon January 31, and noon May 1 in years with no leap year. If Smoe had been born in 1933, his 47th birthday would have been in 1980, a leap year.

1. Translate every sentence in the riddle into explicit constraints that relate an elf’s name, colour, toy-type, and toy-count. (Rudimentary)  

2. Observe that exactly five elves are mentioned by name (Cher, Johnny, Jane, Sue, Marcia); therefore there are five distinct counts, five colours, and five toy-types. (Rudimentary)  

3. Because Santa’s pack held 30 toys and each elf made a different number greater than 2, list the possible unordered sets of five distinct integers > 2 whose sum is 30. (Examples: {3,4,5,8,10}, {3,4,6,7,10}, {3,5,6,7,9}, …). (Rudimentary)  

4. Apply the special ratio clue “The elf who always dressed in green made one-third as many as Sue.”  
   • Green is already fixed as Johnny’s colour, so Johnny’s number = (1/3) × Sue’s number.  
   • Johnny must make ≥ 3 toys, and no two counts are equal, so the only workable pair in the candidate sets is Johnny = 3 and Sue = 9.  
   • Eliminate every number set that does not contain the pair (3, 9).  
   • The only surviving set is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}. (Creative)  

5. Fix Johnny’s assignment: Johnny (green) → 3 racing cars. (Rudimentary)  

6. Note “Five toys were made by Jane,” so Jane’s count is 5. (Rudimentary)  

7. From “Cher made one more than the elf who dressed in red,” deduce that the red-clad elf’s count is 5 and Cher’s is 6; hence the red elf must be Jane and Jane cannot be Cher. (Rudimentary)  

8. From “Cher made one less than the elf who made the sleds,” conclude the sled-maker’s count is 7. (Rudimentary)  

9. Use the given colour clue “Cute Marcia elf was dressed in orange” to lock Marcia’s colour as orange. (Rudimentary)  

10. With the five counts now fixed (3,5,6,7,9), verify they sum to 30, satisfying the total-toy condition. (Rudimentary)  

11. Apply “The elf who dressed in yellow made each and every train.” Because Cher is still missing a colour and already owns the 6-toy slot, assign Cher the yellow clothes and the toy type ‘trains’. (Rudimentary)  

12. Apply “The elf who made the spinning tops made the most toys of them all.” The highest count is 9, so Sue, who makes 9 toys, must make spinning tops. (Rudimentary)  

13. Use “Another perky smiling elf made each and every ball.” With cars, trains, sleds, and tops already claimed, the remaining toy type (balls) must go to the remaining unassigned toy type holder—Jane. Thus Jane (red) → 5 balls. (Rudimentary)  

14. The sled count (7) is still unassigned; link it to Marcia, the only elf without a toy type yet, giving Marcia (orange) → 7 sleds. (Rudimentary)

You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Combine clues 1 and 8.  Eleven photos are boys, and the median boy is at position 12, 13, or 14.  That forces exactly five boys to appear in positions 1–11; to keep within the “no more than three boys per row” restriction, the only way is to put three boys in row 1 and three boys in row 2 (the first two rows now account for six of the eleven boys, five of them before the median).  

2. (Creative)  Use clue 7 (range of boy positions is 24).  If the first boy were placed as late as position 4, the last boy would have to be at 28 and there would be room for only two boys in row 1, contradicting Step 1.  Hence the first boy must be in positions 1-3, and position 28 must be a girl to keep the range exactly 24.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 6 (the second boy is at an odd position).  Since position 4 is even, the second boy cannot sit there, so position 4 is fixed as a girl; the earliest the third boy can now appear is position 5.  

4. (Creative)  Examine the corners with clues 5 and 9.  Placing boys at corners 1 and 25 would force more than three boys on the border, violating clue 5.  Therefore position 1 is a girl, while the remaining two required corner boys must be at positions 7 and 22.  Consequent adjacency rules force positions 6, 14, 15, and 23 to be girls.  

5. (Creative)  To reach the needed three boys in row 1 and honor clue 6, place the second boy of that row at position 5.  Clue 8 then requires a boy at one of the middle spots 12-14; putting a girl at 12 and a boy at 13 meets that condition.  

6. (Rudimentary)  Keep the edge-boy count within the limit of clue 5.  This fixes position 20 as a girl, boys at positions 8 and 21, and position 9 as a girl.  At this point 16 of the 28 positions are determined.

197,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!

199,"I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.",,"Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.

Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.

If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.

Positions: pitcher, catcher, 3rd base, shortstop, left field
RBIs: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Errors: 0, 1, ?, 2, 3
First Inning
By the end of the game, two players were charged with the same number of errors, either 1 or 2. This number (?) is to be deduced from the clues.
Second Inning
No player ended up with the same number of errors and RBIs.
Third Inning
The left fielder had his 1 RBI when, with runners at 1st and 3rd, he hit one over the head of the Peaches' 2nd baseman and into right field.
Fourth Inning
Jimmy Blake earned his 2 RBIs when he hit a triple, allowing the center fielder and the 3rd baseman to score.
Fifth Inning
Flynn had his 1 error when he missed a throw to 1st base.
Sixth Inning
Tim, who posted either 2 or 3 RBIs, ended up with 1 error more than the pitcher after he (Tim) quite literally dropped the ball.
Seventh Inning
The player who finished with no RBIs and 2 errors, including fumbling a fly ball, doesn't play 3rd base.
Eighth Inning
The player who had his 3 RBIs with a game-tying in-the-park home run that had the fans on their feet, scored at least 1 error, but he had fewer errors than the shortstop.
Ninth Inning
K.C. ended the game with 2 fewer errors than the catcher, who let a wild pitch get past him so that the Peaches regained the lead.

207,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:
1. heart, heart, club
spade, spade, club
diamond, diamond, club
2. heart, heart, diamond
spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
3. spade, spade, diamond

heart, heart, diamond
club, club, diamond
5. diamond, diamond, heart
club, club, heart
spade, spade, heart
6. diamond, diamond, spade

heart, heart, spade
Game 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit.

2. (Creative) Consider each remaining possibility for the first leading suit (hearts, spades, diamonds) and, using the “follow-suit/else high-suit” rule, deduce which suits could serve as the single high-suit card in that first trick:

   • Leading spades ⇒ high suit must be diamonds.  
   • Leading diamonds ⇒ high suit could be hearts or spades.

221,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.
Nobby Shifty:
A) I was not the one who was on duty that evening.
B) Norris was on duty.
Morris the Daft:
A) Nobby was the one on duty that evening.
B) I hoped Torks G'Arbage would escape.
Robby O'Mental:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) I was not surprised that Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape.
Considering that, in total, three statements are true and five statements are false, which guard is guilty?",,"Robby left the door open.
The one truth given is that all 4 guards hoped that Torks G'Arbage would escape, so statement B from Morris is a truth.
There are only 3 truthful statements.
If Norris had done it, then Nobby made 2 truthful statements and Robby's statement A would be true; making a total of 4 truths, so it can't be Norris.
If Nobby had done it, statement A from Norris would be true, both of Morris's statements would be true, and Robby's statement A would be true; again a total of 4, so it can't be Nobby.
If Morris had left the cell open, both of Norris's statements would be true, as would Nobby's statement A, Morris's statement B, and Robby's statement A; a total of 5 truths.
In Robby's case, in detail:

230,"Walter, Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke crossed a river in a tiny rowboat. They all started on the same side of the river. They made three trips from the starting side to the destination side, and two trips from the destination side to the starting side. Here are some facts:
1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?",,"Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.
Fact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi.

Jack: We'll all get different grades. If I get an A, then Lucy will get a D.
Jean: If Lucy gets a C, then Jack will get a D. Jack will get a better grade than Paul.

2. Focus on the equation c / b = c.  For a real number x, the only common way x / y = x is satisfied is when x = 0 (or y = 1).  Because the symbols are all different, letting “/” keep its usual meaning makes the most immediate sense; that forces c = 0.  (Creative)

3. Substitute c = 0 into a + c = a.  The equation is now a + 0 = a, so the scrambled “+” must be the operation whose ordinary identity element is 0.

239,"A tourist group of 86 people broke up into two groups. The smaller group went to the beach, and the bigger group went to see a water mill. The following statements are all true. How many people were in each group?
a) A quarter of the people in one of the groups is more than the number of people in the other group.
b) One of the groups contains 6 times as many women as men.
c) One of the groups contains only married couples.
d) The number of people in one of the groups is divisible by 4.
e) One of the groups contains 8 times as many people who are younger than 50 as those who are at least 50 years old.",,"The first thing is to make this question an equation. The equation is x+y=86. x is the larger group and y is the smaller group. So, y=86-x. So, x+86-x=86. If the first statement is true then ¼(x)>y. Since y=86-x, then ¼(x)>86-x. Now find out the greatest possible number that will satisfy the equation ¼(x)>86-x. The largest number y could be is 17. The smallest number x could be is 69.
If c) is true, then one of the groups must be even since ""couples"" are the multiples of 2 (1 couple consists of 2 people, 2 couples consists of 4 people). Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

5. Translate Clue 5 into the equation  T + R₂ + R₃ + R₄ = 25.  (Rudimentary)  

6. Substitute the relations from Steps 2–4 into Step 5, obtaining a single equation that links four variables:

7. Use Clue 3 (L₄ + X + Y + R₄ = 8) to rewrite the left + right sum of Row 4 as  
   L₄ + R₄ = 8 – (X + Y).  (Rudimentary)  

8. Combine Step 6 with Step 7 to express the Row 2–Row 3 sum:

9. List all sets of four distinct digits totalling 8, the only possibilities being {0,1,2,5} and {0,1,3,4}.  (Rudimentary)  

10. For each set, examine every choice of the two middle digits (X,Y), compute X + Y, and see what L₂ + M₃ must equal from Step 8, checking that all digits stay distinct.  (Rudimentary)  

11. Discover that only the set {0,1,2,5} with X and Y = 0 and 1 can work, because it gives X + Y = 1 and forces L₂ + M₃ = 14, a sum that can be achieved with unused digits 6 and 8 while also keeping 1 and 2 non-adjacent.  (Creative)  

12. Fix Row 4 as 2  0  1  5 (L₄ = 2, X = 0, Y = 1, R₄ = 5), ensuring 1 and 2 are separated by 0.  (Rudimentary)  

13. Choose the unused pair (L₂, M₃) = (6, 8) to satisfy L₂ + M₃ = 14.  (Rudimentary)

244,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.

Steps:  
1. (Rudimentary)  Build a 3 × 4 grid labelled #1 – #12 and list the three attribute sets (shape, flavour and row/column position) to be matched.  

2. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 7: “The triangular-shaped chocolate is #1.”  Record that #1 is triangular.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Still from clue 7, record that #9 is not rhombus-shaped and note the other incidental information in the clue (two white chocolates are in rows 1–2, #5 is not cremino, etc.) for later use.  

4. (Creative)  Interpret clue 1.  The four items described there must sit in the same row.  Examining the restrictions coming from the other clues (only one dark and one milk per row, future vertical relations, etc.) shows that the only row capable of accommodating all four simultaneously is the middle row (#5-#8).  Therefore the flower, the dark-chocolate-orange, the “just-below-the-white” piece and the heart-shaped milk-cognac must all be in positions 5-8.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Because the heart chocolate is milk-cognac, place it somewhere in #5-#8; likewise place the flower, the dark-orange and the “below-white” piece into the remaining middle-row squares, leaving their exact order open for the moment.  

6. (Creative)  Use clue 3.  “The cremino chocolate is just to the left of the heart-shaped one and just above the trapezoid.”  Coupling this with the provisional middle-row structure derived in Step 4 forces the pattern …-cremino-heart… across squares #7-#8, which in turn places the trapezoid directly beneath the cremino at #11.  Hence #7 is the round cremino, #8 the heart milk-cognac and #11 the trapezoid.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Bring in clue 4.  Since the dark-orange piece has already been located in the middle row (#6 fits), the hexagon must be directly below it (#10), and the dark-hazelnut must be in the same bottom row and to the right of #10, i.e. at #9.  

8. (Rudimentary)  Apply clue 2 (exactly one dark and one milk per row, never adjacent) to check consistency and to tag the outstanding basic dark and milk pieces.  This pins #4 as the remaining milk-base piece (plain milk) and confirms that no two milk or two dark chocolates sit side-by-side.  

9. (Rudimentary)  Use clue 5.  Only the six “central” squares (#2, #3, #6, #7, #10, #11) are eligible.  Square-shaped (not dark) therefore goes to #2; caramel (not in the same row or column as #2) must then be #11, matching what Step 6 already suggested.  

10. (Rudimentary)  Follow clue 6: round (already #7) must be left of the pentagon and right of the gianduia, all in different rows.  The only consistent way with what is now on the grid is gianduia at #2, round at #7, pentagon at #12.  

11. (Rudimentary)  Return to the outstanding parts of clue 7: the two white-chocolate pieces must be in rows 1 and 2.  The only available matches are #3 (rectangular white) and #5 (flower white-hazelnut).  Record them.  Note also that clue 5’s condition that the square chocolate is not dark is already satisfied.  

12. (Rudimentary)  Fill the few remaining empty attributes so that each shape and flavour is used exactly once, checking against all clues for consistency.  This finalises the grid exactly as in the supplied answer:

This pins #4 as the remaining milk-base piece (plain milk) and confirms that no two milk or two dark chocolates sit side-by-side.  \n\n9. (Rudimentary)  Use clue 5.  Only the six “central” squares (#2, #3, #6, #7, #10, #11) are eligible.  Square-shaped (not dark) therefore goes to #2; caramel (not in the same row or column as #2) must then be #11, matching what Step 6 already suggested.  \n\n10. (Rudimentary)  Follow clue 6: round (already #7) must be left of the pentagon and right of the gianduia, all in different rows.  The only consistent way with what is now on the grid is gianduia at #2, round at #7, pentagon at #12.  \n\n11. (Rudimentary)  Return to the outstanding parts of clue 7: the two white-chocolate pieces must be in rows 1 and 2.  The only available matches are #3 (rectangular white) and #5 (flower white-hazelnut).  Record them.  Note also that clue 5’s condition that the square chocolate is not dark is already satisfied.  \n\n12. (Rudimentary)  Fill the few remaining empty attributes so that each shape and flavour is used exactly once, checking against all clues for consistency.  This finalises the grid exactly as in the supplied answer:  \n#1 Triangular – Dark chocolate  \n#2 Square – Gianduia  \n#3 Rectangular – White chocolate  \n#4 Oval – Milk chocolate  \n#5 Flower – White chocolate-hazelnut  \n#6 Rhombus – Dark chocolate-orange  \n#7 Round – Cremino  \n#8 Heart – Milk chocolate-cognac  \n#9 Hemispherical – Dark chocolate-hazelnut  \n#10 Hexagonal – Tiramisu  \n#11 Trapezoid – Caramel  \n#12 Pentagonal – Milk chocolate-cherry']",2,10
248,"You are a spy trying to gain access to a high profile building that contains very classified information. The only thing standing between you and those secrets is a keypunch security system containing the digits 1-9 that will open the door to the building. Your spy agency has provided you details about the order of the keys you need to enter:
1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.
4. The sum of the first 5 digits pressed is 19; the sum of the last 5 digits pressed is 27.
As you wonder why your agency couldn't just write down the sequence for you, you crack the code and enter the building.
What sequence of keys did you press on the security system to get into the building?",You can figure out the 5th digit to enter from clue 4 and some algebra.,"5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3, 6, 9
From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4. So 8 must be pressed 6th meaning 9 is to be pressed last. This leaves 6 to be entered 8th and 3 to be entered 7th.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  
Creative Steps: 1

Steps:  
1. (Creative)  Add the two given partial sums (19 + 27 = 46) and observe that this equals “(first 4 digits) + (last 4 digits) + 2 × (5th digit).”  Compare this to the total of all nine different digits (1–9) which is 45, allowing the deduction that the 5th digit must be 1 (because 46 − 45 = 1).  

2. (Rudimentary)  Use the fact that 1 is now fixed at position 5 and the rule “no two consecutive digits are adjacent” to decide that 2 cannot occupy position 4 (it would sit next to 1).  Therefore 2 is 2nd and, by the given constraint, 4 is 4th.  

3. (Rudimentary)  Because 7 is numerically consecutive to both 6 and 8, and 6/8 will later occupy positions 6 and 8, 7 cannot be adjacent to either of them; hence 7 can only be 1st or 3rd.  

4. (Rudimentary)  Apply the first–five–digits sum (19) now known to be: digit₁ + 2 + digit₃ + 4 + 1 = 19, giving digit₁ + digit₃ = 12.  This forces the unordered pair {5, 7} into positions 1 and 3.  

5. (Rudimentary)  Check the adjacency rule again: if 5 were 3rd it would stand next to 4 (4th) and violate the “no consecutive digits” rule.  Therefore 5 is 1st and 7 is 3rd.  

6. (Rudimentary)  List the unused digits; only 3, 6, 8, 9 remain for positions 6–9.  

7. (Rudimentary)  Test the two allowed placements for 8 (6th or 8th).  If 8 were 8th, 9 would have to be 6th (to avoid consecutive adjacency 8–9), but 6th is reserved for either 6 or 8—impossible.  Thus 8 is 6th, 9 is 9th, leaving 3 and 6 for positions 7 and 8.  Since 6 and 7 would be adjacent if 6 were 7th, place 3 at 7th and 6 at 8th.
