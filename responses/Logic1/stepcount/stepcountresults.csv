0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Identify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.  Name the order that the daughters were born in and the day of the week that they leave to go home.  What is the seating arrangement at the dinner table?
Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.
A designated driver remains sober in order to drive people who've had too much alcohol home.

Steps:  
1. Extract the seven sets of variables that must all be matched up: daughter’s name, boyfriend’s name, boyfriend’s sport, daughter’s major, daughter’s university, birth order, departure day, and seat at the table.  

2. Use the narrative that the oldest three daughters attend Ivy-League schools, the next two attend UCLA and Berkeley, and the two youngest attend foreign universities (Oxford and Tokyo) to create three ordered school blocks that must line up with birth order.  

3. Note that the father’s Harvard alma-mater reference singles out exactly one Ivy-League daughter as a Harvard student; mark that school for one of the first three birth positions.  

4. Translate the description of the table (“parents at the two ends … couples seated across from each other … boys next to girls … Angelina and Danica next to their parents”) into a seven-row seating grid with one fixed column for each gender and the parents anchored at the ends.  

5. Apply the clue that “all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table” to put football, baseball, golf, water-polo (ball), and water-polo player’s seat in the same column, leaving fencing, wrestling, and swimming in the opposite column.  

6. Insert Christie, Electra, and Edward into the first empty seats mentioned (“took their seats first”) in the order given, giving an initial anchor for the girls’ side and for Edward’s position across from Electra.  

7. Interpret the youngest daughter’s line “the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I’m sitting between the two best passers at the table” to place (a) the biology major between the wrestler and the fencer and (b) herself between the football quarterback and the water-polo driver, pinning four more sports and two majors to precise seat locations.  

8. Combine Farrah’s jealous outburst and later comments to confirm that Farrah is seated beside her own boyfriend, tightening the identity of the football player and Farrah’s seat.  

9. From “the daughter in the middle seat … we’re getting married” mark the fourth couple down from either end as the engaged pair, giving them fixed mating seats, boyfriend and girlfriend.  

10. Follow the champagne-passing passage (“Lars … Gabrielle next to you … Gabrielle, please pass … no alcohol for my three babies”) to position Lars on Mom’s immediate left, Gabrielle on Mom’s immediate right, and to tag the two youngest daughters as under-21 non-drinkers.  

11. Couple the New-Year-at-the-Sheraton statements to link two specific couples by destination (Waikiki vs. Los-Angeles) and to attach those two couples to their respective home cities, thereby hinting at which two universities lie near each hotel (Tokyo and UCLA).  

12. Use the business-major’s storm-avoiding travel (“we have to leave tomorrow … huge storm in the Eastern U.S.”) to tie the business major and her boyfriend to the earliest departure day and an East-Coast school.  

13. Attach the wrestler’s confirmation (“Sir, we’re leaving before Sunday also”) to give the wrestling couple the second-earliest travel day.  

14. Interpret the swimmer / water-polo player conversation about Oxford arrival times to assign Oxford University to the swimming couple and to pin their later common arrival day despite a two-day earlier departure.  

15. Group the physics major’s statement about staying for Grandma but leaving before wedding-gown shopping with the father’s golf invitation to deduce that the golf boyfriend is seated next to the physics major’s boyfriend and that both must depart on Monday (golf-game day) and Tuesday respectively.  

16. Combine the father’s foursome (“it’s a foursome then!”) plus Ian’s lament to identify which two boyfriends already confirmed for golf are Hank and Kyle, matching them to water polo and football and thus to their girlfriends Danica and Farrah.  

17. Reconcile all travel-day clues (“each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave”) with the business-major’s Thursday departure so that the remaining six couples’ days fall Fri–Wed in birth order consistency, assigning: Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed.  

18. Cross-check every constraint—school blocks, majors, sports, seating, departure days, engagement, age status, golf foursome—until a single consistent roster emerges, giving the final table:  
   • Danica–Hank (water-polo, history, Yale, Tuesday)  
   • Electra–Edward (fencing, philosophy, Princeton, Wednesday)  
   • Angelina–Lars (golf, business, Harvard, Friday)  
   • Gabrielle–James (wrestling, political science, UCLA, Saturday)  
   • Farrah–Kyle (football, physics, Berkeley, Monday)  
   • Brooke–Michael (baseball, biology, Tokyo, Thursday)  
   • Christie–Ian (swimming, mathematics, Oxford, Sunday)

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

B) Make lists of the multiples of 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 (for Conditions 5 through 9).  Delete multiples whose digits are the same (33, 44, 66, 77, 88, 99).
C) To satisfy Condition 9, J must be 0.  Delete multiples that require 0 in a different location.  For JA to be prime (Condition 10), A must be: 2, 3, 5, or 7.  Delete multiples of 3 that have another digit for A.

Steps:  
1.  Use the fact that the ten digits 0-9 sum to 45.  
    • (A+B+C+D+E) must be a multiple of 6 and (F+G+H+I+J) a multiple of 5, yet together they must total 45, so the only possibility is 30 + 15.  
    • Likewise (A+C+E+G+I) is a multiple of 9 and (B+D+F+H+J) a multiple of 2; the only pair adding to 45 is 27 + 18.

2.  List every two-digit multiple needed in conditions 5-9 (multiples of 3, 4, 7, 8, 10) and strike out any whose two digits are identical (e.g., 33, 44, 66).

3.  Condition 9 forces J = 0 (since IJ is a multiple of 10).  
    Because JA must be prime (condition 10), A can only be 2, 3, 5, or 7.  
    Eliminate any candidate multiples that violate either fact.

4.  FE and HC must also be prime (condition 10).  
    Therefore C and E cannot be even or 5.  
    Discard every multiple of 4 (for CD) or 7 (for EF) that places an even digit or a 5 in the C or E positions.

5.  Use the required sum B+D+F+H+J = 18 (from step 1).  
    D, H, J are even (needed for the even-number multiples), and J = 0, so B and F must share the same parity.  
    If they were even the total would exceed 18, so both must be odd.  
    Filtering the “7-multiple” list under this restriction leaves exactly EF = 91, so E = 9 and F = 1.

6.  Remove every remaining two-digit candidate that would reuse the digits 1 or 9 in another place.  
    What is left shows that every possible AB still involves the digit 7, and every possible CD still involves the digit 3.

7.  Re-apply the 30-sum requirement on A+B+C+D+E.  
    With E = 9 already fixed, the only way to reach 30 is CD = 36 and AB ∈ {57, 75}.  
    Hence C = 3 and D = 6.

8.  Eliminating any option that now conflicts with the fixed 5, 6, 7 digits leaves only GH choices that contain a 4.  
    The sole surviving multiple of 8 is GH = 24, so G = 2 and H = 4.

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8  
Steps:  
1.  Re-interpret “drawing a star” as choosing a fixed step size k: starting from some vertex, repeatedly advance k vertices modulo n and draw the segment; k must stay constant throughout.  
  
2.  Examine the 5-point case to motivate the rules:  
    • k = 1 (or 4) just traces the pentagon, so it is invalid.  
    • k = 2 gives the familiar star and k = 3 is its mirror image, so there is exactly one distinct 5-point star.  
  
3.  Examine the 6-point case: any admissible k would have to be 2 or 3, but each shares a common factor with 6, so the path closes too early (triangle or line) and no 6-point star exists.  
  
4.  Examine the 7-point case: k = 2 and k = 3 are both coprime to 7, each produces a full seven-vertex tour, and they are not mirror images of each other; hence there are exactly two 7-point stars.  
  
5.  Generalize the observations:  
    • A step size k works iff gcd(k, n) = 1 (otherwise the path closes early).  
    • k = 1 (the adjacent vertex) never works.  
    • k and n − k give mirror-image drawings, so we will later divide the count by 2.  
  
6.  Count the permissible k for n = 1000 = 2³·5³.  Numbers coprime to 1000 are exactly the numbers not divisible by 2 or 5.  
    – There are 500 even numbers (multiples of 2) from 1 to 1000.  
    – There are 200 multiples of 5.  
    – Their overlap (multiples of 10) counts 100 numbers, so the total numbers sharing a factor 2 or 5 is 500 + 200 − 100 = 600.  
    – Thus 1000 − 600 = 400 numbers are coprime to 1000.  
  
7.  Remove mirror duplications by halving: 400 / 2 = 200 candidate step sizes.  
  
8.  Exclude k = 1 (the adjacent-vertex case), leaving 200 − 1 = 199 distinct ways to draw a 1000-point star.",,8,"['Total Step Count: 8  \n', '  \n1.

5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):

At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):

Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

Steps:  
1. Examine the three “special” positions (left end, middle, right end).  
   • Their bordering-suit information (clues 1–5) can involve only two suits in total.  
   • Among the five ranks only Ace and Queen can both satisfy at least one bordering-suit clue, so they must occupy two of those positions.  
   • Because Ace is forbidden from the far left (clue 8), place Queen in the center and Ace on the far right; the card next to the Ace must therefore be a Heart (Ace can border neither black nor diamond cards – clue 5).  
   ⇒ Layout so far: _  _  Q  _  A, with the fourth card a Heart.  

2. Use the “only one ascending triple” condition (clue 7).  
   • Exactly one rank lower than Queen can be left of her (otherwise two triples would appear), so the triple must be Queen–?–Ace.  
   • To prevent Jack-King-Ace or Ten-King-Ace from creating a second triple, King must be to the far left.  
   • To avoid Ten-Jack-Ace making another triple, Jack must precede Ten.  
   ⇒ Complete rank order: K  J  Q  T  A.  

3. Apply the “King next to a diamond” rule (clue 1).  
   • King’s only neighbour is the Jack, so that Jack must be a Diamond.  
   ⇒ Partial suit map: K _ , J ♦ , Q _ , T ♥ , A _.  

4. Bring in the outside information: you personally hold an unknown face card.  
   • It cannot be the Jack (its suit is already fixed).  
   • If it were the Queen, her suit would still be ambiguous and you could not have reached a unique answer.  
   ⇒ Therefore the card in your hand is a King.  

5. Identify which King you hold.  
   • The table King is not a ♦ (clue 6) or a ♥ (clue 3); those two suits are impossible for your own King as well.  
   • If your King were ♣, then King-Jack would already satisfy the Jack’s “next to a spade” clause, leaving the two cards beside Ten undetermined – you would lack enough information to solve the puzzle.  
   • Hence you must hold the King of Spades, leaving the table King to be the King of Clubs.  

6. Finish the suit assignment.  
   • With K♣ on the left and J♦ beside it, the only neighbour that can supply the Jack’s required Spade adjacency (clue 3) is the Queen, so Q♠.  
   • The Ten is already a Heart, so the Ace (its neighbour) must be a Club to keep the Ace free of black and diamond neighbours (clue 5).

Bring in the outside information: you personally hold an unknown face card.  \n   • It cannot be the Jack (its suit is already fixed).  \n   • If it were the Queen, her suit would still be ambiguous and you could not have reached a unique answer.  \n   ⇒ Therefore the card in your hand is a King.  \n\n5. Identify which King you hold.  \n   • The table King is not a ♦ (clue 6) or a ♥ (clue 3); those two suits are impossible for your own King as well.  \n   • If your King were ♣, then King-Jack would already satisfy the Jack’s “next to a spade” clause, leaving the two cards beside Ten undetermined – you would lack enough information to solve the puzzle.  \n   • Hence you must hold the King of Spades, leaving the table King to be the King of Clubs.  \n\n6. Finish the suit assignment.  \n   • With K♣ on the left and J♦ beside it, the only neighbour that can supply the Jack’s required Spade adjacency (clue 3) is the Queen, so Q♠.  \n   • The Ten is already a Heart, so the Ace (its neighbour) must be a Club to keep the Ace free of black and diamond neighbours (clue 5).  \n   ⇒ Opponent’s hand: K♣  J♦  Q♠  T♥  A♣, containing two Clubs.  \n\nTherefore the suit that appears twice is CLUBS.']"
6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 16

Steps:
1. Use clue 8 to place the lowest-level character at level 10 and give that character the dagger.
2. Let the crossbow user’s level be x; by clue 4 the paladin is x + 8 and Raj is x + 16, restricting x to 11–16 (so no level exceeds 32 or falls below 10).
3. Combine clues 2, 6 and 11 to note the elf is neither the paladin, nor Raj, nor the crossbow user, and is exactly 10 levels above the kobold fighter.
4. Bring in the remaining numerical conditions (24-level ogre from clue 1, a 4-level gap in clue 7, and the halfling/bolo “double” relation in clue 3); test the possible x values, discard x = 11, 12, 13, 15 and 14, and conclude x = 16.
5. Fix the five levels as 10 (dagger), 16 (crossbow), 20 (elf), 24 (ogre/paladin), 32 (Raj).  By clue 7 the elf fights chimeras and (because Penny never uses the crossbow—clue 12) the crossbow user is Leonard.
6. Translate clue 1 into a working roster: Penny; the 24-level ogre-paladin; the thief; the fireball user; and the orc fighter.
7. From clue 6 the kobold fighter must be 10 levels below the elf, i.e. at level 10; clue 8 already tied level 10 to the dagger, so the dagger user (not Penny and not the ogre) is the kobold fighter and therefore the thief.
8. Because neither Penny (clue 12) nor the ogre (clue 4) uses the crossbow, the orc fighter must be the crossbow user; hence Leonard is the level-16 crossbow-using orc fighter.
9. Apply clue 3: the bolo user’s level is twice the halfling’s.  With available levels of 10 and 20, the level-10 thief must be the halfling and the level-20 elf (Penny) must be the bolo user.
10. The ogre (level 24 paladin) therefore cannot be the bolo user and takes the last unused weapon, the mace.
11. Clue 1 names a separate fireball user, and Raj is the only player still unassigned a weapon, so Raj becomes the fireball user.
12. Clue 10 forbids the giant fighter from wielding a mace, so the mace-wielding ogre cannot fight giants; Raj (fireballs) therefore fights giants, leaving the ogre to fight harpies.
13. Clue 5 says the hobbit does not fight giants, so Raj cannot be the hobbit; Leonard, already fixed as the orc fighter, becomes the hobbit.
14. The only race left for Raj is gremlin; clue 9 bars a gremlin from being archbishop or merchant, so Raj’s remaining possible occupation is sorcerer.
15. Clue 7 ruled Leonard out as archbishop, so he must be the merchant, which makes Penny (already the elf) the archbishop.
16. The final unchecked statement, clue 13, says Howard does not fight harpies; this is satisfied by giving the harpy-fighting ogre role to Sheldon and leaving Howard as the level-10 halfling thief who fights kobolds.

7,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.",,"Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

Steps:  
1. Use clue 2 to place the fishing spot Big Rock Isle on May 19.  
2. Use clue 4 to establish that the Monkey Trout was caught on May 17.  
3. Apply clue 1: the third fishing day’s fish (May 17) must be either the 8-inch smallest or the 24-inch second-largest.  
4. Combine clue 2 (fish over 20 inches at Old Cutbank on the fourth trip day) with step 3 to decide that May 17’s fish is 24 inches and that the May 17 location is Old Cutbank.  
5. Apply clue 3 to link the 24-inch fish to Mad Ade’s Little Mouse fly, fixing Little Mouse on May 17.  
6. Record the size-parity rule from clue 5 (even sizes on even-numbered days, odd on odd-numbered days, one exception) for later use.  
7. From clue 2 (“Humpback or the 24-inch monster on the 21st”) and step 4, conclude that the Humpback trout is on May 21.  
8. Clue 4 states that the Humpback came from Big Little Falls; therefore Big Little Falls is the May 21 location.  
9. Clue 5 puts a 19-inch fish from Bottle Well on the first or second day; the parity rule forces the 19-inch Bottle Well catch to May 15.  
10. From clue 3 the Dolly Varden must precede the 24-inch fish, and clue 1 forbids Bottle Well, so the Dolly Varden is assigned to May 14.  
11. Apply clue 3’s Stonefly–Mayfly relation: Stonefly Nymph two fishing days before the Mayfly. This fixes Stonefly Nymph on May 15 and Mayfly on May 18, and clue 3 adds that Mayfly was used at Dish Creek.  
12. Clue 4 requires at least four fishing days between the Stonefly Nymph (May 15) and the Humpy fly, so the Humpy fly is placed on May 21.  
13. Clue 3 says all flies after the wet fly on May 19 are dry; hence May 19 must use the remaining wet fly, the Yuk Bug.  
14. From clue 1 the Elk Hair Caddis must occur before both the Brookside catch and the Deep Channel catch; the only open date for it is May 14.  
15. With every other fly placed, the Parachute Adams is assigned to May 20.  
16. Using clue 1 again, identify the Brookside (the 8-inch smallest fish) as the May 18 catch on the Mayfly at Dish Creek.  
17. Because Brookside precedes Deep Channel and Elk Hair Caddis is already on May 14, the remaining unfilled spot Deep Channel is paired with the Parachute Adams on May 20, leaving Little Curl as the location for May 14.  
18. Clue 4 ranks the Monkey Trout (24"") between the Rainbow and the Lake Trout; therefore the only place for the Lake Trout is May 19, and its size must be the largest, 27 inches.  
19. With 24"" and 27"" assigned, the only odd-day size left for May 21 is 17 inches, so the Humpback trout is 17"".  
20. Deep Channel (May 20) inherits the remaining unused size, 22 inches.  
21. Clue 2’s comparison of Little Curl, Dish Creek, and Big Little Falls sizes makes the Little Curl fish larger than Dish Creek’s 8 inch Brookside but smaller than the 17 inch Humpback; thus Little Curl’s Dolly Varden is 16 inches.  
22. Clue 5 says the Rainbow is larger than the Cutthroat; with Rainbow now 22 inches (May 20) and Cutthroat 19 inches (May 15), the condition is satisfied, confirming those assignments.  
23. Compile the final schedule:  
   • May 14 – Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16 in, Little Curl  
   • May 15 – Stonefly Nymph, Cutthroat, 19 in, Bottle Well  
   • May 17 – Little Mouse, Monkey Trout, 24 in, Old Cutbank  
   • May 18 – Mayfly, Brookside Trout, 8 in, Dish Creek  
   • May 19 – Yuk Bug, Lake Trout, 27 in, Big Rock Isle  
   • May 20 – Parachute Adams, Rainbow Trout, 22 in, Deep Channel

Clue 3 says all flies after the wet fly on May 19 are dry; hence May 19 must use the remaining wet fly, the Yuk Bug.  \n14. From clue 1 the Elk Hair Caddis must occur before both the Brookside catch and the Deep Channel catch; the only open date for it is May 14.  \n15. With every other fly placed, the Parachute Adams is assigned to May 20.  \n16. Using clue 1 again, identify the Brookside (the 8-inch smallest fish) as the May 18 catch on the Mayfly at Dish Creek.  \n17. Because Brookside precedes Deep Channel and Elk Hair Caddis is already on May 14, the remaining unfilled spot Deep Channel is paired with the Parachute Adams on May 20, leaving Little Curl as the location for May 14.  \n18. Clue 4 ranks the Monkey Trout (24"") between the Rainbow and the Lake Trout; therefore the only place for the Lake Trout is May 19, and its size must be the largest, 27 inches.  \n19. With 24"" and 27"" assigned, the only odd-day size left for May 21 is 17 inches, so the Humpback trout is 17"".  \n20. Deep Channel (May 20) inherits the remaining unused size, 22 inches.  \n21. Clue 2’s comparison of Little Curl, Dish Creek, and Big Little Falls sizes makes the Little Curl fish larger than Dish Creek’s 8 inch Brookside but smaller than the 17 inch Humpback; thus Little Curl’s Dolly Varden is 16 inches.  \n22. Clue 5 says the Rainbow is larger than the Cutthroat; with Rainbow now 22 inches (May 20) and Cutthroat 19 inches (May 15), the condition is satisfied, confirming those assignments.  \n23. Compile the final schedule:  \n   • May 14 – Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16 in, Little Curl  \n   • May 15 – Stonefly Nymph, Cutthroat, 19 in, Bottle Well  \n   • May 17 – Little Mouse, Monkey Trout, 24 in, Old Cutbank  \n   • May 18 – Mayfly, Brookside Trout, 8 in, Dish Creek  \n   • May 19 – Yuk Bug, Lake Trout, 27 in, Big Rock Isle  \n   • May 20 – Parachute Adams, Rainbow Trout, 22 in, Deep Channel  \n   • May 21 – Humpy, Humpback Trout, 17 in, Big Little Falls']"
8,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 9  
Steps:  
1. Ask the middle god, “If I were to ask you whether the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?”  
2. Rely on the hypothetical form: True or False will answer with the same word (ja/da) when the embedded statement is true and the opposite word when it is false; Random answers arbitrarily.  
3. If the reply is ja, conclude the god on the right cannot be Random (either the left is Random or the speaker is Random).  
4. If the reply is da, conclude the god on the left cannot be Random (either the right is Random or the speaker is Random).  
5. Choose a god now known not to be Random (left or right, as established) for the second interrogation.  
6. Ask that god, “If I were to ask you whether you are the True god, would you say ja?”

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North

Steps:
1. Apply clue 1.1: because peppers are planted three days after the radishes, the radishes must be on May 25 or 27 and the peppers on May 28 or 30.  
2. Apply clue 1.3: broccoli is planted the day after work is done in the west end, so broccoli can only be on May 28-30 and the west plot on May 27-29.  
3. Apply clue 3.3: lettuce is planted the day after the south plot, so lettuce can only be on May 28-30 and the south plot on May 27-29.  
4. With those ranges, the only vegetable that can still fit May 27 (besides possibly the radishes) is tomatoes, so tomatoes are limited to May 25 or 27.  
5. Use clue 2.2: the east side is planted on Saturday, May 25.  
6. Use clue 1.4: tomatoes cannot be in the east; therefore the east-side planting on May 25 cannot be tomatoes.  
7. Since May 25 is east and not tomatoes, it must be radishes (leaving tomatoes for May 27).  
8. With radishes on May 25, clue 1.1 fixes peppers exactly three days later on May 28.  
9. Use clue 3.4: broccoli is not on May 29 and not in the west, and peppers have more rows than broccoli; the only remaining date for broccoli is May 30, leaving lettuce on May 29.  
10. From clue 1.3, the west plot is the day before broccoli, i.e., May 29; hence the west plot contains the lettuce.  
11. Apply clue 3.2: lettuce has fewer than three rows, so it is either one or two rows.  
12. Apply clue 2.4: the northwest corner has an even number of rows (2 or 4).  
13. Apply clue 1.2: radishes are not 1 or 5 rows, broccoli is not 4 or 5 rows, tomatoes are not 1 or 2 rows.  
14. Apply clue 2.3: peppers and tomatoes are not in the northwest corner; the only remaining vegetable that can go there is broccoli.  
15. Because broccoli cannot have 4 or 5 rows (step 13) but the northwest corner must have an even number of rows (step 12), broccoli must be 2 rows.  
16. With 2 rows taken, lettuce (limited to 1 or 2 rows) must therefore be 1 row.  
17. From clue 2.1, the south side has exactly 3 rows; since the south side date is May 28, the south plot must be the peppers, which therefore have 3 rows.  
18. The remaining unused row counts and positions force radishes to have 4 rows (east, May 25) and tomatoes to take the only remaining row count (5) and the only remaining side (north, May 27).

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.

6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.

Steps:  
1. Use clue 5 (tens digit < units digit in G) together with clues 1 and 11 (only one “5” on the card) to decide that the lone number containing a 5 must be placed in G1, then eliminate every other candidate containing the digit 5 from all locations.  
2. Apply clue 6 and strike out every even number from Column O, leaving only odd candidates there.  
3. Apply clue 1 to Row 1 so that the ten different numerals 0-9 each appear once; this forces B1 to hold a 1, I1 a 2, and O1 a 6, while specific candidates (30, 23, 63, 73, 29, 59) are removed with help from clue 3.  
4. Use clue 10 to look for a common prime factor of the five column sums; only 31 works, so make each column total a multiple of 31 (B 31, I 124, N 155, G 248, O 341).  This commits G1 = 58, O1 = 67, N1 = 39, and—using clue 9—G5 = 46 and O5 = 61, while also noting that all remaining two-digit primes must sit in G or O.  
5. Finish Column N: the only set giving the needed 155 total and still obeying clues 4, 8, 9 is {34, 39, 40, 42}; therefore N5 = 34.  
6. Examine Column I: two candidate sets total 124, but to preserve the unique-digit requirement of Row 1, choose the set that contains 24 at I1; put B1 = 10 to keep Row 1 complete, and, using clue 12 (odd diagonal sums), force G4 = 48 and make B5 odd.  
7. Identify the sole column in strict descending order (clue 7) as Column B; with clue 8’s “exactly one repeated numeral” restriction, assign B2 = 9 and B5 = 1.  
8. Use clue 2 (Row 4 must sum to a perfect square); 196 is the only square attainable, so set B4 = 3, I4 = 30, N4 = 42, O4 = 73.  
9. With Column B partially filled and Column N constrained, the remaining legal values give B3 = 8 and N2 = 40.  
10. Employ clue 13 (units digit of B3 × O3 is 2) to pick O3 = 69, which fixes O2 = 71; clue 3 then forces G3 = 47, leaving G2 = 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.

1. Test the possibility H = 8.  Running the chain of rules shows it forces contradictions, so conclude H cannot be 8; simultaneously eliminate the now‐impossible values C ≠ 1, C ≠ 0, B ≠ 9, D ≠ 1, D ≠ 2, and F ≠ 1.  
2. Because H is not 4, 8, or 9, fix H = 1 (the only remaining admissible choice for H) and retain H ≠ 4, H ≠ 9.  
3. With H = 1, apply rules 6 and 7: G cannot be 0, and I cannot be 6 or 7; rule 10 simultaneously removes B = 0.  
4. The only unused value consistent with I’s options is I = 0 (I is also ruled out from being 8), so set I = 0.  
5. Rule 8 with H = 1 and I = 0 eliminates J = 2, 5, or 8 from consideration.  
6. The sole remaining digit compatible with J is 3, so fix J = 3 and strike A = 3, B = 3, and E = 3 from further use.  
7. Rule 10 with J = 3 compels B = 2; consequently F cannot be 2.  
8. Rule 9 with I = 0 and J = 3 forces A = 8; at the same time A cannot be 4 or 7.  
9. Eliminate D = 9 (it no longer fits any allowable option left for D).  
10. Rule 3 with the current inequalities mandates E = 9 and removes E = 5 or 6.  
11. Only 4 is now feasible for D, so set D = 4 and, by rule 4, forbid F = 4.

15,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.

Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:

Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).

2. Apply clue 3: note that Charlie lost the game whose lone surviving ship was a Submarine.  
3. Apply clue 4: note that Fred lost to a player whose last name is Black.  
4. Combine clues 4 and 8: Bart is a winner whose surviving ship was a Carrier; because Bart is not Black (clue 4) and did not defeat Alexis (clue 1), Bart must be in a fourth, as-yet-unnamed game.  
5. Apply clue 10 (plus earlier information): Georgia’s full name is Georgia Roon; she is a winner, not against Charlie, Patty, or Alexis, so she occupies the fifth and last game slot.  
6. Set up the skeleton of the five matches with all presently known winners, losers, and ships (all blanks shown where information is still missing).  
7. Use the five-item list in clue 7:  
   • Patty is the identified loser, so she must have lost to Bart.  
   • Stacie is an identified winner and did not defeat Alexis, therefore Stacie defeated Fred.  
   • “The kid surnamed Brown” is an identified winner and must therefore have defeated Alexis.

16,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.

Steps:  
1. Lay out five ordered house positions (1-to-5) and note every category that must be filled: color, nationality, drink, cigar, and pet.  
2. Apply clue 9 (“The Norwegian lives in the first house”) → Nationality of House 1 = Norwegian.  
3. Apply clue 14 (“The Norwegian lives next to the blue house”) → Color of House 2 = Blue.  
4. Apply clue 8 (“The owner living in the center house drinks milk”) → Drink of House 3 = Milk.  
5. Combine clues 4 & 5 (“The green house is on the immediate left of the white house” and “The green-house owner drinks coffee”).  
   • Because House 2 is blue and House 3 already has its drink fixed (milk), the only left-of-white placement possible is Green = House 4 and White = House 5.  
   • Therefore Color of House 4 = Green, Color of House 5 = White, and Drink of House 4 = Coffee.  
6. Apply clue 1 (“The Brit lives in the red house”) → Pair “Brit + Red” but no red house is fixed yet. The only remaining uncolored house is House 3, so Color 3 = Red and Nationality 3 = Brit.  
7. Apply clue 3 (“The Dane drinks tea”) → Nationality 2 = Dane, Drink 2 = Tea.  
8. Apply clue 7 (“The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill”) → The only uncolored house left is House 1, so Color 1 = Yellow and Cigar 1 = Dunhill.  
9. Apply clue 11 (“The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill”) → Pet 2 = Horse (because House 1 is the Dunhill smoker’s house).  
10. Apply clue 6 (“The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds”) → Assign Cigar 3 = Pall Mall and Pet 3 = Birds (only house still lacking both entries).  
11. Apply clue 2 (“The Swede keeps dogs”) → The only unassigned nationality is Swede and the only unassigned house is House 5, so Nationality 5 = Swede and Pet 5 = Dogs.  
12. Apply clue 12 (“The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer”) → House 5 must take Cigar 5 = Bluemasters and Drink 5 = Beer.  
13. Apply clue 13 (“The German smokes Prince”) → The last unassigned nationality (German) and cigar (Prince) must go to House 4. Thus Nationality 4 = German and Cigar 4 = Prince.  
14. Apply clues 10 & 15 together:  
    • Cigar 2 is still open, so assign Cigar 2 = Blends.  
    • Clue 10 (“Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats”) and the only neighboring houses to House 2 are 1 and 3. House 3 already has birds, so Pet 1 = Cats.  
    • Clue 15 (“Blends lives next to the one who drinks water”) ⇒ House 1 must also have Drink 1 = Water.  
15. Survey the pets: Cats, Horse, Birds, ?, Dogs → the only pet not yet assigned is Fish, and the only house still lacking a pet entry is House 4. Therefore Pet 4 = Fish, making the German the fish owner.

17,"Johnny was given 16 coins by his older, somewhat meaner brother, Mark.  He told him that he could keep them all if he could place all 16 on the table in such a way that they formed 15 rows with 4 coins in each row.
After 10 minutes, Johnny walked away with the coins and Mark, after complaining futilely to his mother, left with nothing.
How did Johnny place the coins?",Stars and pentagons,"If you draw a 5-pointed star with all sides of equal length, you will create a pentagon in the middle with all 5 sides of equal length. Then draw another 5 pointed star, upside-down, using the 5 points of the interior pentagon as the points of the inner star,  This will give you another 5-sided pentagon in the interior of the second, smaller star.
Now, take your 16 coins and place 5 on the outside points of the outside star.  Then place 5 more on the points of each of the two pentagons you have created.  Finally, place the last coin in the dead center of this drawing.
The lines are as follows:
5 lines for the actual drawing of the outside star
5 lines for the actual drawing of the inside star

18,"Zachary has a private zoo.  He has five groups of animals in his zoo:  snakes, birds, mammals, insects, and spiders.  Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.  From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.
1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.
2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.
3) The most populous group has 10 more members than the least populous group.
4) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs.
5) There are as many snake heads as there are spider heads.",,"A) Since there are 3 extra heads (2 snake and 1 bird), there are only 97 animals (clue 1).  Find a set of five different numbers whose sum is 97 (clue 2) and whose size difference between the least populous and most populous group is 10 (clue 3).

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

21,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00	Derec

Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).

The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

Steps:
1. Represent the twelve clock marks from 6:00 to 7:50 (inclusive) by the integers 0–11, each unit equaling ten minutes.

2. Require five birth times that produce ten different pair-wise time gaps with exactly one gap (60 min = 6 units) missing; the only ways this can happen are the sets {0, 1, 4, 9, 11} and its reverse {11, 10, 7, 2, 0}.

3. Note that three stated birth times are 6:00, 6:10 and 7:50, i.e. points 0, 1, 11, so the usable set must be {0, 1, 4, 9, 11} in that order.

4. Convert those points back to clock times: 0→6:00, 1→6:10, 4→6:40, 9→7:30, 11→7:50, giving the 1st through 5th birth slots.

5. Translate the “all five wrong under both alphabetical and reverse-alphabetical assumptions” into position bans:  
   • Caleb, Derec – not 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

1. Use the Derby rule (only 3-year-olds may compete) to infer that the horse that ran—and lost—last year must now be 4 years old.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 13  

Steps:  
1. From clue 5 (C × H is prime), note that one factor must be 1, so either C = 1 or H = 1.  
2. From clue 6 (A / G = G / C ⇒ A·C = G²) and the restriction that all digits are distinct, the only digit triples {A,G,C} that work are 9-3-1, 4-2-1, and 8-4-2.  
3. Test 8-4-2: with A = 8 and C = 2, clue 1 (A + D is a square) forces D = 1. But 1 is already needed for C or H (step 1), so 8-4-2 is impossible.  
4. The viable {A,G,C} pairs left are 9-3-1 and 4-2-1; in both, C = 1.  
5. Assume 9-3-1. Then clue 1 (A + D square) and clue 2 (G + J triangular) force D and J to be 0 and 7 in some order, while E and F must both be odd (clue 4). Four odd digits (9,3,1,7) are already taken, leaving only 5 for both E and F, which is impossible; reject 9-3-1.  
6. Therefore {A,G,C} = 4-2-1; fix A = 4, G = 2, C = 1.  
7. With G = 2, clue 2 (G + J triangular) gives J = 8 (the only remaining digit making 2 + J a triangular number).  
8. Consider digit 6: D can’t be 6 (4 + 6 ≠ square), E or F can’t be 6 (their product must be odd), and H can’t be 6 (6 × 1 is not prime). Hence 6 must go to B or I.  
9. Clue 3 (B + I even) and the fact that 6 is the sole available even digit mean B and I must be {0,6}.  
10. With A = 4, choose D so that 4 + D is a square; among unused digits, D = 5 satisfies 4 + 5 = 9.  
11. Clue 7 (E + I = B + H) and {B,I} = {0,6} imply E and H differ by 6. The remaining digits that do so are 3 and 9.  
12. Assign H = 3 and E = 9 (either order works, but this one is chosen), leaving F the only remaining unused digit 7; this also keeps E × F odd (clue 4).

1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

Steps:
1. Start with MANGO: assign M-A-N-G-O to pyramids 1-2-3-4-5 respectively.

2. LEMON shares M, N, O with MANGO, so L and E must join A or G.  
   PEACH forbids E with A, therefore place E on pyramid 4 (with G) and L on pyramid 2 (with A).

3. In OCHRE, C and H cannot sit with O (already on pyramid 5).  
   From PEACH the only remaining letter that can accompany O is P, so put P on pyramid 5.

4. From CANDY, C cannot be with N, so put C with M on pyramid 1 and H with N on pyramid 3.  
   FORTY stops Y from sharing O, so place Y on pyramid 4; put D (the last letter of CANDY) with O on pyramid 5.  
   To finish OCHRE, add R to pyramid 2.

5. FORTY needs F and T on pyramids 1 and 3; LIGHT forbids H with T, so set T on pyramid 1 and F on pyramid 3.  
   LIGHT then forces I onto pyramid 5.

6. JABOT requires J and B on pyramids 3 and 4; BELOW forbids B with E, so B goes to pyramid 3 and J to pyramid 4.  
   BELOW also supplies W, which must fit on pyramid 1.

7. HELIX places X on pyramid 1.  
   Only one slot remains on pyramid 3; it must be a letter common to VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, i.e. U.  
   With U fixed, V from VIEUX is placed on pyramid 2.

8. QUICK forbids Q with I (pyramid 5), so Q joins pyramid 2.  
   QUEST forbids S with E (pyramid 4), so S goes to pyramid 5.  
   The lone remaining unassigned letter is K, which therefore belongs on pyramid 4.

28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior

*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated",,"Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.
Ivy & Carl were swapped",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8  

Steps:  
1. Only one person can be the Liar, so Carl’s claim “Ivy is the Liar” means exactly one of Carl or Ivy is lying; therefore everyone not named Carl or Ivy (Draco, Xavior, Emma) is speaking truthfully.  

2. No statement contradicts June, so she is also taken to be telling the truth (even though she spoke first and could have been switched).  

3. June’s true line “Emma knows Draco’s role” forces Emma to be in a Cupid-made pair; the truthful possibilities reduce to Emma paired with either Draco or June.  

4. Because Cupid cannot pair them-self, Emma cannot be Cupid; Xavior’s true statement “Draco or June is Normal” also prevents Emma from being Normal.  

5. Emma truthfully says “I don’t know the Spy,” eliminating Detective and Spy for her; the only remaining role for Emma is Switcher.  

6. If Emma is the Switcher, the only way she can know Draco’s role is that June must be Cupid and must have paired Emma with Draco. Hence June = Cupid and Draco is Emma’s partner.  

7. Given June is Cupid, Xavior’s truthful “Draco or June is Normal” fixes Draco as the single Normal player.  

8. With Draco = Normal, June = Cupid, Emma = Switcher and only one Liar allowed, the leftover roles distribute uniquely: Xavior (still truthful) is the Detective, leaving Ivy as the Liar and Carl as the Spy; Emma must have switched Ivy and Carl.",,8,"['Total Step Count: 8  \n\n', '  \n1.

29,"One day, an eccentric billionaire decided to give a destitute man a break. But not a total break, as we shall see. So, he invites him into a room in his mansion with seven doors. There is also a large-screen projector that projects the following five images, repeatedly, one at a time:
A human brain, Earth, the incomplete phrase: 'Fair and ____,' the letters AZCONMUT and a cheese sandwich on plain white bread with the edges perfectly cut off.
The poor man was allowed an entire day to study the images, after which he would have to choose the door that corresponded to the commonality of the images. The next day the man walked through the correct door, and the billionaire made him rich. What door did the man choose?","Take a snack break, have one of the images.","The man chose door number FOUR. Here's why:
The image of the human brain made the man think of 'four corners of the mind.'
He recognized the capital letters AZCONMUT to be the abbreviations of the 'Four corner states' Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. He completed the phrase
'Fair and ____' with the word SQUARE, which also has also four corners. When he got hungry, he ordered the same sandwich in the last image. But instead of eating right away, he studied it, until he got the point that it too had four corners. Thus, the poor guy walked into a mansion poorer than poor, and walked out with a cheese sandwich, and enough dough to buy a small country. What he actually did with the money is anybody's guess.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5

4. He notices the cheese sandwich with its crusts neatly cut off is a perfect square, which likewise has four corners, repeating the “four” motif.
