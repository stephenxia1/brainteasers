0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Identify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.  Name the order that the daughters were born in and the day of the week that they leave to go home.  What is the seating arrangement at the dinner table?
Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.
A designated driver remains sober in order to drive people who've had too much alcohol home.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

Steps:  
1. Note that the ten different digits 0-9 add to 45.  
   • For Conditions 1 and 2 the two five–digit sums must partition 45 into a multiple of 6 and a multiple of 5; the only way is 30 + 15.  
   • For Conditions 3 and 4 the two five–digit sums must partition 45 into a multiple of 9 and a multiple of 2; the only way is 27 + 18.  

2. List every two-digit multiple relevant to Conditions 5–9 (multiples of 3, 4, 7, 8, 10) and discard any whose two digits are identical (33, 44, 66, 77, 88, 99).  

3. Because IJ must be a multiple of 10, set J = 0.  
   Since JA has to be prime, A can only be 2, 3, 5, or 7.  
   Remove from the lists any two-digit multiple that puts 0 anywhere but J or puts some other digit, not 2/3/5/7, in A.  

4. Because FE and HC must also be prime, neither C nor E may be even or 5.  
   Delete any candidate multiples of 4 (for CD) and 7 (for EF) that give an even digit or 5 for C or E.  

5. From Condition 4, B + D + F + H + J = 18.  
   D, H, J are even (they finish even multiples), so to keep the total even B and F must be either both even or both odd; if both were even the total would be 20, so B and F are odd.  
   After eliminating candidate multiples with an even B or F, the only viable multiple of 7 left is 91, fixing E = 9 and F = 1; eliminate any option that places 1 or 9 elsewhere.  

6. Among the remaining choices every possible AB now contains 7, and every possible CD contains 3.  
   Discard any candidate that tries to use 7 or 3 in some other position.  

7. Using the 30-sum requirement from Condition 1, the only way to reach it is with CD = 36 and AB = 57 (or 75, which conflicts with earlier eliminations).  
   Hence C = 3 and D = 6; strike out any remaining option that would reuse 5, 6, 7 incorrectly.  

8. Only pairs left that satisfy GH multiple-of-8 use the digit 4, so GH must be 24.  
   Delete any alternative that would move 4 elsewhere.  

9. Apply the 27-sum requirement from Condition 3: with C = 3 and E = 9, we need A + G + I = 15.  
   The sole surviving combination of unused digits that works with the remaining two-digit multiples is AB = 57, GH = 24, IJ = 80.

3. Make a third, shorter pass; with the current restrictions the only new deduction is that B cannot be 8.  

4. Focus on D, now limited to {1, 2, 4, 8}.  Test each value by following the forced implications through the equations:  
   • D = 1 ⇒ contradiction (J would have to be both 4 and 0).  
   • D = 2 ⇒ duplicates digit already needed for G.  
   • D = 4 ⇒ forces a duplicate for A or I.  
   • D = 8 works; it forces G = 2 (from D = G × 4), F = 1 (from G = F + 1), and A = 5 (from A = G + 3).  

5. Turn to E, now restricted to {0, 3, 6, 7}.  Test each:  
   • E = 0 ⇒ J would be 1, duplicating F.  
   • E = 3 ⇒ C would be 2, duplicating G.  
   • E = 7 ⇒ J would be 8, duplicating D.  
   • E = 6 works; it forces J = 7 (from E = J – 1), H = 9 (from J = H – 2), and C = 3 (from H = C × 3).

4,"Typical ""stars"" are drawn in connected, but not repeated, line segments. For example, a 5-point star is drawn as such - line segments AC, CE, EB, BD, DA. The segments must always alternate a constant number of points (in the above case, skipping 1 point in between).
Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work. Think of factors and mirror images.  Try drawing out examples.,"199.
First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10

Steps:
1. Recognise that a “star” is produced by repeatedly connecting each vertex to a fixed-distance neighbour (the same “skip length’’ each time); different skip lengths give different drawings.

2. Test this idea on n = 5: skipping 2 works (AC, CE, …) while skipping 3 is just its mirror image – hence only one 5-point star.

3. Test n = 6: skipping 1 yields a hexagon, skipping 2 a triangle, skipping 3 a straight line, and mirrors give nothing new – so no 6-point star exists.

4. Test n = 7: skipping 2 and skipping 3 each give a valid continuous star, while the other skips are mirrors or failures – giving two distinct 7-point stars.

5. Abstract the observations: every drawing has a mirror image, so when counting we will eventually divide by two; furthermore skip = 1 (adjacent vertices) must always be excluded because it produces the regular n-gon, not a star.

6. Notice that if the skip length shares a common factor with n, the path closes early and does not visit every vertex; hence only skip lengths that are coprime to n can work.

7. Combine these facts: the valid skips are all numbers less than n that are coprime to n, except 1, and then we halve the count to remove mirror duplicates.

8. Factorise n = 1000: 1000 = 2³ × 5³.

9. Count integers 1–1000 that are NOT coprime to 1000: multiples of 2 (500) plus multiples of 5 (200) minus their overlap (100) give 600; therefore 400 numbers are coprime to 1000.

10. Apply the counting rule: start with 400 coprime skips, remove mirror duplicates (÷2 → 200), then exclude skip = 1 (and its mirror) to obtain 199 distinct stars for 1000 points.",,10,"['Total Step Count: 10\n\n', '\n1.

5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 13  
Steps:  
1. From clue 8, fix the lowest skill level at 10 and tie it to the dagger user.  
2. Use clue 4 to set a chain of levels: crossbow = x, paladin = x + 8, Raj = x + 16; since levels top out at 32 and bottom out above 10, x ≤ 16.  
3. Combine clues 2, 6 and 11 to note that the elf is not in the chain of step 2 and is exactly 10 levels above the kobold fighter.  
4. Test all admissible x values against numeric clues 1, 3 and 7; only x = 16 satisfies every requirement, so the levels are 10, 16, 20, 24, 32.  
5. Match the levels: 16 = crossbow, 24 = paladin (and ogre by clue 1), 32 = Raj, 20 = elf; clue 7 ties the 20-level elf to chimeras and (with clue 12) makes the 16-level crossbow user Leonard.  
6. From clue 1 list the five “special” characters: Penny, the 24-level ogre–paladin, the thief, the fire-ball user, and the orc fighter.  
7. Because elf (20) = kobold + 10 (clue 6) and dagger = level 10 (clue 8) while neither Penny nor the ogre uses the dagger, the thief must be the level-10 dagger-wielding kobold fighter.  
8. Penny and the ogre cannot have the crossbow (clues 12 and 4), so the orc-fighting crossbow user is Leonard.  
9. Clue 3 says bolo-user = 2 × halfling’s level; no one is level 12, so the ogre can’t have a bolo; therefore Penny has the bolo at level 20 and the level-10 thief must be the halfling.  
10. With bolo and crossbow assigned, the ogre’s remaining weapon becomes the mace.  
11. The only unclaimed weapon is fireballs, so Raj uses them.  Penny is already fixed as the 20-level elf who fights chimeras.  
12. Clue 10 forbids the giant fighter from using a mace, so the ogre (mace) fights harpies, leaving Raj (fireballs) to fight giants.  
13. Clue 5 bars the hobbit from giants, so the hobbit must be Leonard (orc fighter); the remaining race for Raj is gremlin, and by clue 9 that gremlin can’t be archbishop or merchant, so Raj is the sorcerer.  Leonard, not being archbishop (clue 7), is the merchant, which leaves Penny as the archbishop.  Clue 13 is automatically satisfied, completing the full assignment:

Howard – halfling, level 10 thief, dagger, kobolds  
Leonard – hobbit, level 16 merchant, crossbow, orcs  
Penny – elf, level 20 archbishop, bolo, chimeras  
Raj – gremlin, level 32 sorcerer, fireballs, giants

7,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.",,"Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th (4).
Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day. (1)
17th is 8 or 24.
On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. (2)
17th is 24 and Cutbank.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse (3).
With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. (5)
He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st.
Humpback is 21st. (2)
Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. (5)
Humpback is Big Little Falls.
The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. (5)
First day is 14th, so 19 incher had to be second day, 15th.
15th then is Bottle.
Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden (3).
Mouse is 24 inch fish on 17th.
Dolly is 14th or 15th.
Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly nymph. (3)
Mayfly can only be 18th, as Mouse is 17th.
Stonefly is 15th.
Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek.
At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. (4)
Stonefly is 15th, so Humpy is 21st.
Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. (3)
Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

Steps:  
1.  From clue 2 set the fishing spot for 19 May to Big Rock Isle.  
2.  From clue 4 set the species for 17 May to Monkey Trout.  
3.  Clue 1 says the 3rd fishing-day fish (17 May) is either the smallest or 2nd-largest, so its size is 8″ or 24″.  
4.  Clue 2 says the 4th trip-day fish (17 May) was “over 20 in” at Old Cutbank on a wet fly; therefore 17 May is 24″ at Old Cutbank.  
5.  Clue 3 ties the 24-inch fish to the Little Mouse fly, so Little Mouse belongs to 17 May.  
6.  Record clue 5’s even-day/even-size, odd-day/odd-size pattern for later use.  
7.  Clue 2 lets May 21 be either the 24-incher or a Humpback; 24″ is already on 17 May, so 21 May is Humpback.  
8.  Clue 4 links the Humpback on the last day to Big Little Falls, so 21 May’s spot is Big Little Falls.  
9.  Clue 5 puts the 19-inch Bottle Well fish on day 1 or day 2; choose day 2, so 15 May is Bottle Well and 19″.  
10. Clue 3 says the 24-inch Little-Mouse fish came after a Dolly Varden, so Dolly Varden is earlier than 17 May and not the 15 May Bottle Well fish, leaving 14 May or 15 May.  
11. Clue 3: the Mayfly is 3 calendar days after the Stonefly Nymph; counting the calendar yields Mayfly on 18 May and Stonefly Nymph on 15 May.  
12. Still in clue 3, Mayfly was used at Dish Creek, so 18 May’s spot is Dish Creek.  
13. Clue 4 demands ≥4 fishing days between Stonefly Nymph (15 May) and the Humpy (21 May); this requirement is satisfied.  
14. Clue 3 says all flies after the wet fly used on 19 May are dry; the only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so 19 May carries the Yuk Bug.  
15. Clue 1: the Elk Hair Caddis precedes the Brookside and both precede Deep Channel; the only day available for Elk Hair Caddis is 14 May, so assign it there.  
16. The sole unassigned fly, Parachute Adams, therefore goes to 20 May.  
17. Clue 1 also says Dolly Varden is not the Bottle Well fish, so Dolly Varden is fixed to 14 May.  
18. The smallest Brookside (8″) must be after Elk Hair Caddis (14 May) and before Deep Channel; it can be on 18 May or 20 May pending other data.  
19. Clue 2 compares Little Curl > Dish Creek < Big Little Falls; making Dish Creek 8″ satisfies this, so Brookside 8″ is on 18 May and 14 May’s place becomes Little Curl.  
20. With Brookside on 18 May, Deep Channel (the site after Brookside) is forced to 20 May.  
21. Clue 4 says the Monkey Trout (24″) is longer than the Rainbow but shorter than the Lake Trout; the only odd, longer size available is 27″, so 19 May is Lake Trout (27″) and 20 May is Rainbow (22″).  
22. By elimination the 19-inch Bottle Well fish (15 May) must be a Cut Throat.  
23. The even/odd size rule now fixes 21 May at 17″ and 14 May at 16″, matching earlier assignments.  
24. Check the Little Curl comparison: Dish Creek 8″ < Little Curl 16″ < Big Little Falls 17″ ― satisfied.  
25. Check clue 5’s Rainbow > Cut Throat requirement: Rainbow 22″ (20 May) is indeed larger than Cut Throat 19″ (15 May).  All conditions are now met, giving the final grid:  
• 14 May – Elk Hair Caddis, Dolly Varden, 16″, Little Curl  
• 15 May – Stonefly Nymph, Cut Throat, 19″, Bottle Well  
• 17 May – Little Mouse, Monkey Trout, 24″, Old Cutbank  
• 18 May – Mayfly, Brookside Trout, 8″, Dish Creek  
• 19 May – Yuk Bug, Lake Trout, 27″, Big Rock Isle

8,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  

Steps:  
1. Ask the middle god Question 1: “If I were to ask you whether the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?”  
2. Use the hypothetical-question technique: any non-Random god will answer “ja” when the embedded statement is true and “da” when it is false, independent of which word means yes.  
3. Interpret the reply to Question 1:  
   • “ja” ⇒ the right-hand god is definitely not Random.  
   • “da” ⇒ the left-hand god is definitely not Random.  
4. Address that known non-Random god with Question 2: “If I were to ask you whether you are the True god, would you say ja?”  
5. Decode the reply to Question 2 with the same rule: “ja” shows the god is True; “da” shows the god is False.  
6. Put Question 3 to this now-identified god: “If I were to ask you whether the middle god is Random, would you say ja?”

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.
Summary:
Tomatoes, Five, 27th, North
Peppers, Three, 28th, South
Radishes, Four, 25th, East
Lettuce, one, 29th, West
Broccoli, two, 30th, Northwest",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 18  

Steps:  
1. From clue 1.1 note that peppers are planted exactly three days after the radishes.  
2. Convert that relation to dates: radishes can only be on the 25th or 27th, making peppers fall on the 28th or 30th respectively.  
3. Clue 1.3 says the west plot is worked one day before broccoli is planted, so broccoli can be on the 28-30 May range and “west” one day earlier (27-29 May).  
4. Clue 3.3 says lettuce is planted one day after the south plot, so south is on 27-29 May and lettuce on 28-30 May.  
5. Clue 2.2 fixes the east plot to Saturday, 25 May; clue 1.4 bans tomatoes from the east. Hence east-25 must hold radishes; tomatoes must use the only other early slot, 27 May; therefore peppers must be 28 May (three days after the 25th radishes).  
6. Clue 3.4 states broccoli is not on the 29th, not in the west, and peppers have more rows than broccoli. Given peppers are on the 28th, broccoli must be 30 May, forcing lettuce to 29 May (one day after the south date).  
7. Re-apply clue 1.3: since broccoli is 30 May, the west plot (one day earlier) is 29 May, matching lettuce’s date; therefore lettuce occupies the west plot.  
8. The south plot must be the day before lettuce, i.e. 28 May; thus peppers (already fixed on the 28th) are in the south plot.  
9. Clue 3.2 restricts lettuce to fewer than three rows ⇒ 1 or 2 rows.  
10. Clue 2.4 requires the northwest plot to contain an even number of rows ⇒ 2 or 4 rows.  
11. Clue 2.3 excludes peppers and tomatoes from the northwest plot, so broccoli is the only vegetable that can go there.  
12. Therefore broccoli is in the northwest plot and must have an even number of rows (2 or 4).  
13. Apply clue 1.2: radish rows > broccoli rows and tomato rows > radish rows. If broccoli were 4 rows the needed larger numbers would be impossible, so broccoli must be 2 rows.  
14. Lettuce must have <3 rows and cannot use 2 (already used by broccoli), so lettuce takes 1 row.  
15. Clue 2.1 fixes the south plot at exactly 3 rows, so peppers (in the south) have 3 rows.  
16. With broccoli at 2 rows and peppers at 3, clue 1.2 forces radishes to 4 rows and tomatoes to 5 rows.  
17. Sides now assigned are: East-Radishes, West-Lettuce, South-Peppers, Northwest-Broccoli; the only unassigned side for tomatoes is the North.  
18. Final arrangement:  
   • Radishes – 4 rows – 25 May – East  
   • Tomatoes – 5 rows – 27 May – North

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.  I can not exceed H, so J would have to be 3 (8 already assigned to H).  G can not exceed H, so I would have to be either 6 or 7.  I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

Steps:  
1. Try placing 8 at H and trace the implied inequalities; the attempt fails, so rule out H = 8 and simultaneously eliminate C = 1 or 0, B = 9, D = 1 or 2, and F = 1.  
2. Conclude that the only consistent value left for H is 1; therefore H ≠ 4 or 9.  
3. With H = 1, the inequalities force G ≠ 0 and force I ≠ 6 or 7; this also makes B ≠ 0.  
4. The only remaining place for 0 is I, so set I = 0 and exclude I = 8.  
5. Using I = 0 and the inequalities, eliminate J = 2, 5, 8.  
6. The only viable value for J is 3; this, in turn, rules out A = 3, B = 3, and E = 3.  
7. With J = 3 and rule 10 (“J > A → … else B = 2 or 3”), deduce B = 2 (and thus F ≠ 2).  
8. Rule 1 (“A > B → C = 5 or 7, else …”) together with B = 2 forces A to take the larger choice, giving A = 8 (so A ≠ 4 or 7).  
9. Rule 2 with B = 2 shows D cannot be 9.  
10. Considering the remaining options for E under rule 3, fix E = 9 and remove E = 5 or 6 from contention.  
11. With E = 9 and rule 4, determine D = 4 and eliminate F = 4.  
12. Rule 4 now leaves F = 6 as the only possibility; consequently G ≠ 6.  
13. Rule 5 then forces G = 5, ruling out C = 5.

15,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.
The last names are Azzuro, Black, Blanc, Brown, Chartrel, Lavender, Peach, Roon, Tanger, and Yeller.","From clue 1, Alexis' last name is Chartel, and she lost.  From clue 3. Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).
In summary:
Bart Tanger beat Patty Lavender by a Carrier.

Steps:  
1. Use clues 1, 3, 4, 8 and 10 to identify the five separate matches and the basic facts for each: Alexis Chartel lost; Charlie lost in the Submarine game; Fred (not Blanc) lost to the child surnamed Black; Bart (not Black) won with the Carrier in a different game; Georgia Roon won, but not against Alexis or Charlie.  

2. Consult the five-item list in clue 7 to match winners and losers to those five games: Patty’s listed loss must be to Bart; Alexis (not defeated by Stacie) must have lost to the winner listed as Brown; Fred (not Blanc) must have lost to Stacie Black; the “Blanc” loser in clue 7 must be Charlie, making Georgia Roon the Patrol-Boat winner.  

3. Apply clue 2 (Azzuro’s surviving ship shorter than the winner over Yeller) together with the still-unused ship lengths: designate Fred as the Yeller who lost to Stacie Black, forcing Stacie’s ship to be the Battleship (longer than Charlie’s Submarine).  The only remaining winner slot for the surname Azzuro is the one that beat Charlie, so that victor (still unnamed) keeps the Submarine.  With Carrier and Battleship already taken, the only ship left for Brown’s win over Alexis is the Destroyer.  

4. Use clue 5 (Lavender vs Tanger) and clue 9 (Peach shares Lavender’s result) to place last names in the Bart-Patty game: Bart Tanger (winner) versus Patty Lavender (loser).  Since Lavender lost, Peach must also lose, so Lila Peach becomes Georgia Roon’s defeated opponent.  

5. Bring in the gender restriction of clue 6 and the note in clue 2 that Azzuro is “not Jason” to pin down the remaining first names: the Azzuro who beat Charlie must be Roger (the other boy), while the Brown who beat Alexis must therefore be Jason (leaving Lila as Peach).

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

21,"The ABC Express pulled out of the station late one night and began its winding journey up the coast to its destination under heavy darkness. Owing to the late hour, there were only a handful of passengers aboard the small train. At the stroke of midnight, the lights illuminating the interior of the two cars were suddenly extinguished. When they flicked back to life a few moments later, the passengers were alarmed to see one of their number lying on the ground motionless.
The conductor phoned the local police department, and though it was very late, the dispatcher assured the worried conductor that they were sending their very best detective. A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1.

23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00	Derec
6:10	Adele	0:10 later
6:40	Brand	0:30 later, 0:40 after Derec

7:50	Caleb	0:20 later, 1:50 after Derek, 1:40 after Adele, 1:10 after Brand.
The missing interval is one hour.
Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).  The only ways to arrange them to get ten different intervals for the births are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 and the reverse: 11, 10, 7, 2, and 0.  The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.
Finally, we have Caleb and Derec to fill the first and last spots.  Caleb and Nora share a birth position.  The first paragraph mentions that Cogita is Nora's older sister, so Caleb cannot be the firstborn.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

1. Convert the 6:00–7:50 window into twelve ten-minute “tick marks,” numbered 0-through-11, and note from the description that the only interval that fails to appear among the gaps is 60 minutes.  

2. Ask which 5 of those 12 tick marks can produce the ten distinct gaps 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes.  The combinatorics shows only two viable quintuple-sets: {0, 1, 4, 9, 11} (in increasing order) and its reverse {11, 10, 7, 2, 0}.  

3. Match the three explicit times already given (6:00, 6:10, 7:50 → ticks 0, 1, 11) with the two candidate sets; they fit the first set, so the usable time-order is 0, 1, 4, 9, 11 → 6:00, 6:10, 6:40, 7:30, 7:50.  

4. Translate the “five wrong either way” clue (alphabetical and reverse-alphabetical naming would each miss every position) into placement restrictions:  
   • Caleb and Derec cannot be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.  
   • Adele and Elena cannot be 1st or 5th.  
   • Brand cannot be 2nd or 4th.  

5. Apply the 50-minute Brand–Elena separation; the only 50-minute gap inside {0,1,4,9,11} is between ticks 4 and 9, so Brand and Elena must occupy the 3rd and 4th times (6:40 and 7:30) in some order.  

6. With Brand and Elena occupying slots 3 and 4, the only remaining middle position (slot 2, tick 1 = 6:10) must go to Adele, satisfying all her restrictions.  

7. The first (6:00) and last (7:50) positions are left for Caleb and Derec.  Because Caleb is to share Nora’s birth position and the story tells us Nora is not the eldest among her siblings (Cogita is older), Caleb cannot be firstborn; therefore Derec is first (6:00) and Caleb is last (7:50).

24,"Seven horses in a farm in Kentucky,
Of three blacks, the oldest is a daddy;
Of two browns, the 3 year old male is called BILLY,
And the horse SNOWY is white as a lily.
Of two half-sister mares, the black won in the Derby,
She's a shade lighter than her daughter, BEAUTY;
BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie,
But faster than either ROCKY or SUNNY.
Three of the horses are ready for the Derby,
A horse must be three years to be an entry;
Maybe this year the farm gets lucky,
Their stallion's loss last year was a pity.
CHALLENGE: Describe the horse that lost in last year's Derby.","For purposes of this riddle the following terms are defined as:
Mare- female horse
Stallion- mature male horse
Derby- a race for three year old horses.","SNOWY, a 4 year old male white horse lost last year.
The Derby is for three year old horses. Therefore only a current four year old horse could have lost last year.
SNOWY is the only horse which could have been three last year (four this year).
The farm is preparing three of the seven horses for this years Derby. There must therefore be at least three 3-year old horses among the seven. BILLY is 3-years old. Necessarily, BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY must be 3 years old both. (They are of the same age).
Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year. This would mean that no horse would be four years old as BEAUTY and LUCKY would be one and a half years old. BEAUTY's mom won in the DERBY as a three year old, she could not win and lose at the same time. (The riddle suggests that the farm did not win last year so the mom must be over 5 years old).
In sum, if BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY are three years old, their aunt must be six. BEAUTY's mom must be five or more. The oldest black must be older than the black mom. Only SNOWY could be four this year.
SNOWY is white (given), 4 years as deduced, and male from the fact that it was a stallion which lost last year.

Steps:  
1. Note the rule: only 3-year-old horses may run in the Derby, so the horse that lost last year (ran as a 3-year-old) must be 4 years old now.  
2. Observe from the poem that the farm is preparing “three of the horses” for this year’s Derby, so there must be at least three 3-year-olds in the current group.  
3. Identify the first 3-year-old explicitly named: BILLY (“the 3-year-old male”).  
4. Use the line “BEAUTY and her cousin LUCKY, both half the age of their auntie” to see that BEAUTY and LUCKY share the same age and are half of their aunt’s age.  
5. Show that the aunt cannot herself be 3 (else the ‘half-age’ statement would force BEAUTY and LUCKY to be 1½, impossible for Derby entries), so the aunt must be 6 and hence BEAUTY and LUCKY are 3.  
6. Conclude the three current Derby entries are BILLY, BEAUTY, and LUCKY, satisfying the farm’s “three horses … ready for the Derby.”  
7. Note that BEAUTY’s mother already “won in the Derby,” so she must be older than 3 now (at least 5).  
8. Note that “the oldest black” is even older than BEAUTY’s mother, making the oldest black ≥ 6.  
9. From the ages already assigned (three 3-year-olds, one ≥ 6 aunt, mother ≥ 5, oldest black ≥ 6) the only unassigned age left in the 7-horse set that can be 4 is for SNOWY.  
10. Recall SNOWY is explicitly stated to be white; additionally, the losing horse was described as “their stallion,” so SNOWY must be male.

For the product of two numbers to be a prime number (clue #5), one of those two numbers must be 1.  Therefore, either C or H must be 1.
To achieve the required proportion (clue #6), the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations:  931 or 421 or 842.
If [AGC] = 842, then D would have to be 1 (clue #1).  Since either C or H must be 1, then D can not be 1.  Since D can not be 1, then A can not be 8.  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 842.  The only remaining possibilities for [AGC] are 931 and 421.  In either case, C = 1.
If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10

1: M
2: A
3: N

The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.

The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.

28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated",,"Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.

Steps:
1. Use Carl’s claim (“Ivy is the Liar”) together with the fact that there is exactly one Liar to conclude that exactly one of the pair {Carl, Ivy} is lying; therefore everyone who is not Carl or Ivy (namely Draco, Xavior, and Emma) must be telling the truth in all of their statements.  

2. Show that June’s statements are also true: although June spoke first and could theoretically have been the original Liar before a switch, the one-Liar restriction combined with Step 1 rules that out, so June’s current statements are truthful as well.  

3. From June’s truthful line “Emma knows Draco’s role,” infer that Emma is in a pair.  Enumerate all five possible ways that the line could be true or false; eliminate the three possibilities that require June or Emma to lie; conclude that Emma is indeed paired (with either Draco or June).  

4. Eliminate the possibilities that Emma is Cupid or Normal:  
   • Cupid cannot pair them-self, so Emma cannot be Cupid if she is in the pair.  
   • Xavior truthfully says “Draco or June is Normal,” so Emma cannot hold the Normal role.  

5. Eliminate the possibilities that Emma is Detective or Spy by using Emma’s own truthful statement “I don’t know the Spy.”  Either of those roles would give her knowledge of the Spy, so they are impossible.  The only remaining role for Emma is Switcher.  

6. Re-examine June’s line “Emma knows Draco’s role.”  The two surviving scenarios are  
   (a) Emma is Detective paired with June, or  
   (b) June is Cupid who paired Draco and Emma.  
   Since Step 5 ruled out Emma being Detective, scenario (b) must be correct: June is Cupid and she paired Draco with Emma.  

7. Apply Xavior’s truthful statement “Draco or June is Normal.”  June is now fixed as Cupid, so Draco must be Normal.  

8. Assign the three remaining roles:  
   • Xavior’s truthful denial “I’m not the Spy” leaves him as the only candidate for Detective.  
   • Carl’s truthful line “Xavior knows who was switched” fits Xavior being Detective and confirms that Carl has knowledge of the switch, making Carl the Spy.  
   • The single remaining unfilled role, Liar, therefore goes to Ivy, and the swap that lends Carl his Spy knowledge must have been between Ivy (original Liar) and Carl (original Spy).",,8,"['Total Step Count: 8\n\n', '\n1.

2. Apply the “no more than three girls in any diagonal” rule (clue 9).  
   • If position 33 were a girl there would be four girls on its long SW–NE diagonal, so position 33 must be a Boy.

   • Row 2 already has four girls, so positions 14, 22, 28 (row 4) must be Boys.  
   • Putting a girl at 32 would create a four-girl diagonal, so position 32 is also a Boy.  

5. Complete the gender count while satisfying clue 6 (total of 18 Boys whose position numbers sum to < 315).  
   • Fifteen Boys are placed; two more are needed.

Complete the gender count while satisfying clue 6 (total of 18 Boys whose position numbers sum to < 315).  \n   • Fifteen Boys are placed; two more are needed.  \n   • To keep every diagonal within the three-girl limit, the only available squares for additional Boys are 6, 18, 30.  \n   • Current Boy total = 289; adding 6 + 18 keeps the Boy sum at 313 (< 315).  \n   • Declare 6 and 18 Boys and leave every remaining unassigned square (15, 20, 21, 30, 34, 35) for Girls.  \n\n6. Locate Stacey using clues 1 and 2.  \n   • Search all straight-line triples for positions whose numbers sum to a prime; the finished grid leaves only {8, 9, 12} (sum 29) and {9, 10, 12} (sum 31).  \n   • Stacey must not border either friend, so in both triples the non-bordering square is 12.  \n   • Therefore Stacey’s picture is at position 12.']"
32,"These five businessmen represented different companies at a recent trade fair. Unfortunately, the hotel they were all due to stay in had accidentally double booked their rooms. They tried other hotels in the area, but all were fully booked. Consequently, they all agreed to share the only two rooms available in the hotel - one twin and one triple.
From the clues, can you work out each man's name, company and official title?
1. When the five men realized their dilemma, they drew straws to see who would share with whom. The outcome for four of them was that the CEO shared with the businessman from ABM Inc. and Edgar shared with the Developer.
2. Alan does not work for Reed Right and is not the Director. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth.
3. Neither Clarkson nor Grimaldi works for Reed Right. Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO.
4. The businessman from Reed Right did not share a room with Thomas.
5. Clarkson, who does not work for Lantel, shared with either Thomas or Grimaldi but not both.
6. Edgar's surname is either Casson or Graves. Edgar did not share with Carl.
7. The businessman from Chiptech shared with the businessman from Lantel.
8. The CEO shared with the IT Analyst.
9. Casson works for either Blue Teeth or Chiptech.
10. Neither Joshua nor Alan works for ABM Inc.
11. Fielder shared with the Director.
12. The Accountant from Blue Teeth shared with the Developer.
First names: Alan, Carl, Edgar, Joshua, Thomas.
Last names: Casson, Clarkson, Fielder, Graves, Grimaldi.
Company: ABM Inc., Blue Teeth, Chiptech, Lantel, Reed",,"First Name, Last Name, Company, Position:
Carl Grimaldi, ABM Inc., IT Analyst
Edgar Casson, Chiptech, Director
Joshua Graves, Reed Right, CEO
Alan Clarkson, Blue Teeth, Accountant
Thomas Fielder, Lantel, Developer
To solve this teaser, you first need to determine who shared which room with whom. Three delegates shared the triple and two shared the twin. The CEO shared with the businessman from ABM in one room and Edgar shared with the Developer in the other (1). Since Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO (3) and the CEO shared with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi is in the same room as whoever is the CEO, IT Analyst and ABM delegate although Grimaldi could have been one of these people. Edgar did not share with Carl (6) so Carl is in the same bedroom as, and possibly is, the CEO, IT Analyst, Grimaldi and/or the ABM delegate. Grimaldi and Thomas were in different rooms so Thomas shared a room with Clarkson (5) and the Reed Right delegate was in a different room to Thomas. At this stage we know:
Room 1
CEO
IT Analyst
ABM delegate
Grimaldi
Carl
Reed Right delegate
Room 2
Edgar
Developer
Thomas
Clarkson
Since the Chiptech delegate shared with the Lantel delegate (7), both of these must have been in room 2 otherwise there would be four delegates in room 1 which is not possible.
Now this has been ascertained, the puzzle can be solved:
The CEO shared with the IT Analyst so the IT Analyst must work for ABM (Clues 1 and 8) so the CEO must work for Reed Right. Since Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must be the IT Analyst. Clarkson, Fielder and Casson are in room 2 so the CEO must be Graves. Graves is not Edgar (1), Thomas (4), Carl (IT Analyst) or Alan (2) so must be Joshua. Clarkson is not Thomas (5), Edgar (6), Carl or Joshua (in room 1) so must be Alan. The Director does not work for Lantel or Blue Teeth (2), Reed Right or ABM (room 1) so must work for Chiptech. This is not Graves or Grimaldi (room 1), Clarkson (2) or Fielder (11) so must be Casson. Since Graves; first name is Joshua, Casson must be Edgar (6). Alan Clarkson does not work for Reed Right or ABM (room 1); Lantel (5) or Chiptech so must work for Blue Teeth. Since he is not the Developer (12) he must be the Accountant. This leaves Thomas Fielder who is the Developer for Lantel.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 15

Steps:
1. Establish the basic room structure from clue 1: one room contains the CEO together with the ABM delegate, the other contains Edgar together with the Developer.  
2. Apply clues 3 and 8: because Grimaldi is either the IT Analyst or the CEO and the CEO shares with the IT Analyst, Grimaldi must be in the same room as the CEO, the IT Analyst and the ABM delegate.  
3. Use clue 6: Edgar does not share with Carl, so Carl is in the same room as the CEO/IT Analyst/ABM/Grimaldi group.  
4. Combine clues 5 and 4: Grimaldi and Thomas are in different rooms, therefore Thomas shares with Clarkson, and the Reed Right delegate is also in the opposite room from Thomas (i.e., in the room with Carl and Grimaldi).  This gives a provisional room layout:  
   • Room 1 – CEO, IT Analyst, ABM delegate, Grimaldi, Carl, Reed Right delegate  
   • Room 2 – Edgar, Developer, Thomas, Clarkson  
5. Apply clue 7: the Chiptech delegate must share with the Lantel delegate, so both Chiptech and Lantel delegates belong to Room 2.  
6. Use clues 1 and 8 together: since the CEO shares with both the ABM delegate and the IT Analyst, the IT Analyst must work for ABM and, consequently, the CEO must work for Reed Right.  
7. From clue 3: because Grimaldi does not work for Reed Right, he must therefore be the IT Analyst (and hence the ABM delegate).  
8. Note the surnames present in Room 2 (Clarkson, Fielder, Casson). The only remaining surname for the CEO in Room 1 is Graves, so the CEO’s surname is Graves.  
9. Eliminate first-name possibilities for Graves using clues 1, 2, 4 and the room allocations: the CEO is not Edgar, Thomas, Carl or Alan, leaving Joshua; therefore the CEO is Joshua Graves.  
10. Identify Clarkson’s first name: Clarkson is not Thomas (already Fielder), not Edgar, not Carl, and not Joshua (CEO), so Clarkson must be Alan; thus Alan Clarkson is in Room 2.  
11. Determine the Director’s company by clue 2: the Director cannot work for Lantel or Blue Teeth, and (by room information) not for Reed Right or ABM, so the Director must work for Chiptech.  
12. Decide who is the Director: among the Chiptech delegates in Room 2, it cannot be Graves or Grimaldi (they’re in Room 1), nor Clarkson (ruled out by clue 2), nor Fielder (clue 11 says Fielder shared with the Director), leaving Casson; hence Casson is the Director from Chiptech.  
13. Resolve Edgar’s surname using clue 6: because Graves’ first name is Joshua, Edgar must be Casson; therefore Edgar Casson is the Chiptech Director.  
14. Assign Alan Clarkson’s company and position: he cannot be with Reed Right, ABM, Lantel or Chiptech, so he works for Blue Teeth. Since Blue Teeth’s representative in Room 2 is not the Developer (clue 12), Clarkson is the Accountant; thus Alan Clarkson is Blue Teeth’s Accountant.

33,"Patrice and seven of her friends organized the Ultimate Table Tennis Challenge to determine who the best Ping-Pong player among them was. The challenge consisted of three rounds of singles matches (two players competing per match). In each round, the first player to win FIVE games won the match and eliminated the opponent from the competition. The winners of the four first round matches advanced to the second round and the two second round winners advanced to the championship match. Each match was played at a different location, including the Beachcomber Swim Club. All first round matches were played on outdoor tables, both second round locations were indoor tables and the final round was played in the table tennis stadium at the New York Athletic Club. No two people won the same number of games, so players eliminated in the same round were ranked by the total number of games won. Identify each competitor's final ranking (first through eighth), full name (one last name is Chang), and the total number of games he or she won. In addition, figure out each location of each match, the competitors and their scores.
1. The winner of the match at the Southville YMCA lost at least three games on the indoor table in Uncle Phil's basement before meeting McNeilly in the finals.
2. The first round opponent of the eventual champion was neither Fitzroy (who lost in the first round) nor the person who lost at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy.
3. The championship round took the maximum possible number of games in a match.
4. The seven matches, in some order, were: Jamie's first round victory, the match in which White won exactly 2 games, the match at Eastlake Municipal Park, the match that Lottie lost, the only match Diaz played, the match Toskhaya lost and the match in which somebody won exactly one game.
5. Bill never played Dave.
6. Averson didn't play Jamie in the first round.
7. A total of 55 games were played in the whole challenge, 30 of which were the first round matches.
8. McNeilly, who isn't Lottie or Kristin, never played Samuel or Gianelli.
9. The four who advanced to the second round were: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina in the first round and someone whose indoor match was at the Islip Town Hall.
10. McNeilly's opponent in the first round won more games than Diaz.
11. Kristin never played at the Southville YMCA.
12. Regina won more games than the person eliminated at Eastlake Municipal Park.
13. Kristin won more games than Bill, who won at least five.

The final match was played at the New York Athletic Club (intro). The loser in the championship round lost 4 games (3) for a total of 9 games in the final round (intro and 3).
There were 30 matches in the first round (7); with 20 of them being wins (intro) therefore the total of lost games in the first round are 10. From clue 4, we know that somebody won exactly 1 game. From the intro we know no one won the same number of games, therefore the number of games lost in the first round is 1, 2, 3, and 4, can't have 5 because that means they would have advanced to the next round.
This leaves 55 (total games played (clue 7)) - 30 (1st round - clue 7) - 9 (Final round - clue 3) = 16 games in 2nd round. 10 of these 16 games are the winner's games, which leaves 6 games for the losers in round 2. The 2 loser's games can't be 3 & 3, because this would mean both players would have a total of 8 games each. No two players won the same number of games (intro). They can't be 5 & 1 because that would leave a tie and only 1 can advance. They can't be 6 & 0 because 5 wins advances someone, so no one can win 6. This leaves 2 & 4 as the games won by the losers in the second round.
This means the total numbers of matches won from 1st ranked to 8th ranked are: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2 and 1 for a total off 55 games (7).
From clue 1 we know that the Southville YMCA was used in round 1, Uncle Phil's Basement is used in round 2 and McNeilly is in the final game, which means McNeilly won a match in round 1 and in round 2 for a total of either 14 (if he loses the finals) or 15 (if he wins the finals) games.
Islip Town Hall is used in the 2nd round (9), which leaves Eastlake Municipal Park, The Beachcomber Swim Club and Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy being used for the other 3 matches in the first round.
From clue 9, we know the four first round winners are: White, Lottie, the one who played Regina in the first round and The Islip Town Hall match. McNeilly has to be 1 of these four (1). McNeilly isn't Lottie (8), can't be White since both are last names, so is either the one who played Regina or the one who played at Islip Town Hall. Regina lost the first round match (9).
White is in the second round (9) and is the player who won only two games (4), which means White doesn't go to the finals and won a total of 7 games.
From clue 4, four of the 1st round matches are: Jamie's 1st round victory, Eastlake Municipal Park (see above), the only match Diaz played and someone who won exactly one game. We know White won exactly two games (4) and the final round took the maximum number of games (3), therefore White's 2 game win has to be in the 2nd round. Since we now know the four 1st round matches, Toskhaya had to win in the 1st round and moves on to round 2.
From clue 13, Bill won at least 5 games and Kristin won more than Bill. This means that both Bill and Kristin won their first round matches and moves on to the second round. The four players in round 2 are: Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin. One of these four was the eventual winner, but it wasn't Bill (13) or Lottie (4), so Jamie or Kristin is the winner. Kristin isn't McNeilly (8) and never played at Southville (11), so she didn't play in the finals (1). This makes Jamie the winner.
Since Bill didn't finish second overall (13 and above), he wasn't Jamie's opponent in the finals. Kristin wasn't in the finals (see above); therefore Lottie lost in the final match with a total of 14 games overall. Jamie and Lottie were the 2nd round winners. Lottie isn't McNeilly (8), therefore Jamie is, who won the final round.
Lottie isn't Toskhaya (4) or White (9), therefore Lottie played against Toskhaya in round two.
In the 1st round, Jamie McNeilly didn't play Fitzroy (2), Averson (6), Diaz (4) or Gianelli (8); thus he played Chang. Jamie didn't play at the Southville YMCA (1), Eastlake Park (4), Brooklyn Academy (2), thus he played on the Beachcomber Swim Club table in round one. Jamie didn't play Lottie, Kristin or Bill in round one, since they are winners in round one. Jamie didn't play Samuel (8) or Dave (14). From clue 9 Regina was the one who played Toskhaya in round one, therefore Jamie had to play Patrice in round 1.
From clue 1 and above, we know Lottie played at the Southville YMCA in round one.
From clue 13, Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin is Toskhaya and Bill is White.
Regina didn't play at Eastlake (12) and she won more than one game, therefore she is Diaz.
Regina Diaz didn't win overall 1 game (4); she won more than the Eastlake player (12) but less than McNeilly's first round opponent (10) -who is Patrice Chang. Thus, she won 3 games overall, the Eastlake opponent won 2 games overall and Patrice Chang won 4 games overall.
Kristin didn't play at the Southville YMCA; therefore she played at the Brooklyn Academy.
Lottie played Jamie in the final round, therefore her last name isn't Fitzroy (2) or Gianelli (8), therefore she is Averson.
Lottie Averson played at Southville YMCA (1 and above).
Bills 1st round opponent wasn't Dave (5), thus Lottie played Dave and Bill played Samuel in the 1st round. Samuel isn't Gianelli (8), thus he is Fitzroy and Dave is Gianelli.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 23  

Steps:  
1. From clue 3 the championship went the full 9 games, so the score there was 5-4.  
2. Because a match ends when someone reaches 5 wins, 4 is the most games a loser can win.  
3. Clue 7 gives 55 total games; subtract the 30 first-round games and the 9-game final to leave 16 games in the second round.  
4. The two second-round winners contribute 10 of those 16 games (5 each), so the two second-round losers together won 6 games; with all win-totals different, those must be 2 and 4.  
5. First-round losers won a total of 10 games; with no duplicates these must be 1, 2, 3 and 4.  
6. Combining per-round results produces the unique overall win totals: 15, 14, 9, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1.  
7. Clue 1 says the Southville YMCA winner later lost at least 3 games indoors at Uncle Phil’s before meeting McNeilly in the final, so the Southville winner is the runner-up and McNeilly is the other finalist.  
8. Therefore McNeilly won in rounds 1 and 2 (total 14 or 15 wins).  
9. Islip Town Hall (clue 9) is the remaining second-round site, leaving four first-round venues: Beachcomber, Southville, Eastlake and Brooklyn.  
10. Clue 9 lists the round-one winners: White, Lottie, the person who played Regina, and the Islip winner. Because McNeilly is a round-one winner and is neither Lottie (clue 8) nor White, he is either Regina’s opponent or the Islip winner; Regina therefore lost in round 1.  
11. Clue 4 says White had exactly 2 wins in one match; 2 is a second-round-loser score, so Bill White is a semifinal loser with 7 total wins (5+2).  
12. Since White’s 2-win match is in round 2, he necessarily won his round-one match and occupies the Islip semifinal mentioned in clue 9.  
13. The matches enumerated in clue 4 guarantee that Toskhaya is another first-round winner and thus a semifinalist.  
14. Clue 13 states Kristin won more games than Bill, so Kristin Toskhaya also reached the semifinals; the four semifinalists are Jamie, Lottie, Bill and Kristin.  
15. Bill’s total of 7 and clue 4 rule him out as champion; Lottie is runner-up (step 7); Kristin cannot be champion because she is not McNeilly (clue 8) and never played at Southville (clue 11). Hence Jamie is champion and is Jamie McNeilly.  
16. Therefore Lottie (the Southville winner) is the 14-win runner-up who lost 5-4 to Jamie in the final.  
17. Lottie is neither Toskhaya (clue 4) nor White, so her semifinal opponent was Toskhaya; their match at Uncle Phil’s ended 5-4 for Lottie.  
18. Jamie’s first-round opponent was not Fitzroy (clue 2), Averson (clue 6), Diaz (clue 4) or Gianelli (clue 8), leaving Chang; and his match was not at Southville, Eastlake or Brooklyn, so it was at the Beachcomber Swim Club, score 5-4.  
19. Clue 9 says Regina’s opponent in round 1 was a winner; with Jamie already placed, that opponent must be Kristin Toskhaya, who beat Regina 5-3 at the Brooklyn Table Tennis Academy (Kristin never played at Southville per clue 11).  
20. The only unused first-round site, Eastlake Municipal Park, therefore hosted Bill White’s 5-2 victory.  
21. Clue 5 forbids Bill from ever playing Dave, so Bill’s opponent at Eastlake must be Samuel; Southville’s 5-1 loss belongs to Dave.  
22. Clues 2 and 8 give the surnames: Samuel is Fitzroy, Dave is Gianelli; Lottie, being neither of those and identified in clue 6, is Lottie Averson; Regina is the only Diaz.  
23. These placements produce the complete chart stated at the top of the human solution:  
• 1st Jamie McNeilly 15 (Beachcomber 5-4 over Patrice Chang; Islip 5-2 over Bill White; NYAC 5-4 over Lottie Averson)  
• 2nd Lottie Averson 14 (Southville 5-1 over Dave Gianelli; Uncle Phil’s 5-4 over Kristin Toskhaya; NYAC loss 4-5)  
• 3rd Kristin Toskhaya 9 (Brooklyn 5-3 over Regina Diaz; Uncle Phil’s loss 4-5)  
• 4th Bill White 7 (Eastlake 5-2 over Samuel Fitzroy; Islip loss 2-5)  
• 5th Patrice Chang 4 (Beachcomber loss 4-5)  
• 6th Regina Diaz 3 (Brooklyn loss 3-5)  
• 7th Samuel Fitzroy 2 (Eastlake loss 2-5)

34,"Here's what you have:
-Two 8-liter jugs, filled with water
-One 3-liter jug, empty
-Four infinite size, empty pools
Here's what your objective is:
Fill each of the four pools with exactly 4 liters of water.
Here are your constraints:
-You have nothing else at your disposal.
-There is no other water aside from the two 8-liter water filled jugs.
-Once water is poured into any of the 4 pools it cannot be removed from there.
-The jugs are not symmetric so you cannot measure amount by eye or judge based on shape.","I am not sure how to help you :). I solved this in 24 steps (you may have more or less). It helps to label the jugs and pools, and then draw. Oh, main key, try to work backwards, from filled pools, and see what final steps are even possible.","It's not short but it's right - use a piece of paper and follow the steps using A, B, C and pools. Change the quantities in each as you complete each step - it is worth it to see it come out right.

Jug B - second 8-liter
Jug C - 3-liter.

37,"Six sets of twins ( a boy and a girl in every case) made several errors in their history and geography examinations; and it was noted that every girl made precisely the same number of errors as her brother in the two subjects. Name each pair of siblings and their surname and work out how many mistakes each made in their history and geography examination papers.
1. The boy (not Luke) whose sister is Louella made more history errors than Sammy.
2. George did better in history than the boy surnamed O'Connell, who made either one more or one less geography error than the twins surnamed Dean.
3. Anne made either one more or one less geography error than Louella.
4. The twins who made 11 geography errors didn't make exactly 11 history errors.
5. David and his sister made either one more or one less mistake in the history exam than the twins who made 14 geography errors.
6. Edward and his sister did worse at history than the pair who made 15 geography errors. Edward made one more error in the geography exam than Luke.
7. The McCall twins didn't make one less history mistake than the Vole twins.
8. Susan (who made seven history errors) made one less geography error than the girl who made one less history error than Anne.
9. The twins surnamed Waters made one more history mistake than the twins surnamed Seal, who made more geography errors than the McCall twins.
10. Gail made one more geography error than the girl who made one more history error than Louella.
11. Martin made either one more or one less geography error than his best friend and his sister, who made more history mistakes than Diane.
12. Wendy and her brother (who didn't make eight history mistakes) didn't make as many errors in geography as George and his sister.
Brothers are David, Edward, George, Luke, Martin & Sammy.
Sisters are Anne, Diane, Gail, Louella, Susan & Wendy.
Surnames are Dean, McCall, O'Connell, Seal, Vole & Waters.
Geography errors are 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16.
History errors are 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 & 12.",,"Susan made seven history errors (clue 8) and no one made nine, so Anne made either 11 or 12. Louella didn't make six history errors (1), so (10) must have made either 10 or 11. If Louella made 11 and Anne made 12, then Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8) and Gail made one more than Anne (10). But then, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 doesn't work. So Louella made 10 history errors. If Anne made 11 history errors, then Gail made one more geography error than Anne (10) and Susan made one less geography error than Louella (8). But again, since no one made 13 geography errors, clue 3 still doesn't work. So Anne made 12 history errors.
The twins with 11 errors made one more geography error than Susan (8) and one less than Gail (10), so Gail made 12 or 16 geography errors and Susan made 10 or 14 : while twins with 11 history errors made 11 or 15 geography errors. Thus those with 11 history errors made 15 geography errors (4), Gail made 16 geography errors and Susan made 14. Edward made 12 history errors (6) so is Anne's brother; Anne and her brother made either 10, 11 or 12 geography errors, so (6) made 11 or 12 and Luke and his sister made 10 or 11, ie one of them made 11. Luke's sister isn't Louella (1), so Luke made either six or eight history errors, as did David (5). Thus David's sister is Gail.
Anne made 11 geography errors (3), so Luke made 10 and Louella made 12. Sammy's sister is Susan (1). Wendy made 10 geography errors (12), so Diane made 15. Luke (who is Wendy's brother) made six history errors (12), so David made eight. By elimination, Sammy made seven and so is Susan's brother. Martin's sister is Louella (11). Diane's brother is George. Edwards is surnamed O'Connell (2) and the Dean girl is either Louella or Wendy (10 or 12 geography errors). The Waters and Seal twins (9) made either eight and seven history errors or else 11 and 10; so the Seal twins made 14 or 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10 or 12. If the Seal twins made 12 geography errors and the McCall twins made 10, then (above) the Dean twins are excluded. Thus Sammy's surname is Seal and David's is Waters. Diane's surname is Vole.

Steps:  
1.  From clue 8 we know Susan made 7 history errors; because 9 is not a possible history score, Anne’s history score (one higher than another girl’s) can only be 11 or 12.  

2.  Clue 1 shows Louella cannot have 6 history errors (otherwise her brother’s 6 could not be “more than Sammy”), so the girl referred to in clue 10 (one history point above Louella) must have 10 or 11 history.  

3.  Trial 1 – Louella 11 H, Anne 12 H: clues 8 and 10 then force Susan’s and Gail’s geography totals to require a nonexistent 13, so this trial is impossible.  

4.  Trial 2 – Anne 11 H, Louella 10 H: gives the same impossible need for a 13 geography score, so this too is rejected.  Therefore Anne has 12 H and Louella 10 H.  

5.  Using clues 8 and 10: Susan’s geography is one less than the twins with 11 H, whose geography is one less than Gail’s.  Hence (Susan, 11-H twins, Gail) form consecutive geography scores: Susan 10/14, the 11-H twins 11/15, Gail 12/16.  

6.  Clue 4 forbids the 11-H twins from also having 11 G, so they must have 15 G; consequently Gail has 16 G and Susan 14 G.  

7.  Clue 6 gives Edward 12 H, making him Anne’s brother.  Their geography must be one of the unused numbers (10, 11, 12) and is one more than Luke’s.  So either Edward/Anne have 11 G and Luke 10 G, or they have 12 G and Luke 11 G.  

8.  Because Louella’s brother is not Luke (clue 1), Luke’s sister is someone else and Luke’s history must be 6 or 8.  Clue 5 puts David’s history also at 6 or 8 (one away from the 14-G pair Susan/Sammy).  Thus the 6- and 8-history scores belong to Luke and David.  

9.  Clue 12 says Wendy’s brother did not make 8 history errors and that their geography total is lower than George’s pair.  Therefore Luke (not the 8-history boy) is Wendy’s brother and both have 10 G, giving Luke 6 H.  

10.  The 8-history score therefore belongs to David; since Gail alone has 16 G, Gail must be David’s sister.  Pair David-Gail: 16 G, 8 H.  

11.  Clue 3 requires Anne’s geography to differ by 1 from Louella’s.  With 10, 11, 12 still unused, the only fit is Anne 11 G and Louella 12 G, which also fixes Luke’s geography at 10 G (from Step 7).  

12.  Clue 11 can now be satisfied only if Martin is Louella’s brother (Louella 12 G, 10 H), so Martin-Louella is the 12-G, 10-H pair.  

13.  The sole unassigned history value is 7, so Sammy has 7 H; he therefore pairs with Susan (7 H, 14 G), confirming clue 1.  

14.  George is the only unpaired boy and so is Diane’s brother, making George-Diane the remaining 11-H, 15-G twins.  

15.  Clue 2: George (11 H) did better than the O’Connell boy; the only worse score is 12 H, so Edward is O’Connell.  O’Connell’s geography (11 G) differs by 1 from the Deans’, putting the Dean surname on Martin-Louella (12 G).  

16.  Clue 7 forbids the McCall twins from having one less history error than the Vole twins.  Choosing McCall for Luke-Wendy (6 H) avoids a difference-of-1 conflict, so Luke-Wendy are McCall.  

17.  Clue 9: Waters twins have one more history mistake than Seal twins, and Seal twins have more geography errors than McCall twins (10 G).  The compatible consecutive history scores are 7 H and 8 H, with geographies 14 G and 16 G.  Thus Sammy-Susan (7 H, 14 G) are Seal and David-Gail (8 H, 16 G) are Waters.  

18.  With Dean, McCall, O’Connell, Seal and Waters assigned, the only surname left is Vole, so George-Diane are Vole, meeting clue 7 automatically.  

19.  Every slot is now filled:  
• David & Gail Waters – 8 H, 16 G  
• Edward & Anne O’Connell – 12 H, 11 G  
• George & Diane Vole – 11 H, 15 G  
• Luke & Wendy McCall – 6 H, 10 G  
• Martin & Louella Dean – 10 H, 12 G

Therefore Luke (not the 8-history boy) is Wendy’s brother and both have 10 G, giving Luke 6 H.  \n\n10.  The 8-history score therefore belongs to David; since Gail alone has 16 G, Gail must be David’s sister.  Pair David-Gail: 16 G, 8 H.  \n\n11.  Clue 3 requires Anne’s geography to differ by 1 from Louella’s.  With 10, 11, 12 still unused, the only fit is Anne 11 G and Louella 12 G, which also fixes Luke’s geography at 10 G (from Step 7).  \n\n12.  Clue 11 can now be satisfied only if Martin is Louella’s brother (Louella 12 G, 10 H), so Martin-Louella is the 12-G, 10-H pair.  \n\n13.  The sole unassigned history value is 7, so Sammy has 7 H; he therefore pairs with Susan (7 H, 14 G), confirming clue 1.  \n\n14.  George is the only unpaired boy and so is Diane’s brother, making George-Diane the remaining 11-H, 15-G twins.  \n\n15.  Clue 2: George (11 H) did better than the O’Connell boy; the only worse score is 12 H, so Edward is O’Connell.  O’Connell’s geography (11 G) differs by 1 from the Deans’, putting the Dean surname on Martin-Louella (12 G).  \n\n16.  Clue 7 forbids the McCall twins from having one less history error than the Vole twins.  Choosing McCall for Luke-Wendy (6 H) avoids a difference-of-1 conflict, so Luke-Wendy are McCall.  \n\n17.  Clue 9: Waters twins have one more history mistake than Seal twins, and Seal twins have more geography errors than McCall twins (10 G).  The compatible consecutive history scores are 7 H and 8 H, with geographies 14 G and 16 G.  Thus Sammy-Susan (7 H, 14 G) are Seal and David-Gail (8 H, 16 G) are Waters.  \n\n18.  With Dean, McCall, O’Connell, Seal and Waters assigned, the only surname left is Vole, so George-Diane are Vole, meeting clue 7 automatically.  \n\n19.  Every slot is now filled:  \n• David & Gail Waters – 8 H, 16 G  \n• Edward & Anne O’Connell – 12 H, 11 G  \n• George & Diane Vole – 11 H, 15 G  \n• Luke & Wendy McCall – 6 H, 10 G  \n• Martin & Louella Dean – 10 H, 12 G  \n• Sammy & Susan Seal – 7 H, 14 G']"
38,"It is your task to determine how high you can drop a billiard ball without it breaking. There is a 100 story building and you must determine which is the highest floor you can drop a ball from without it breaking. You have only two billiard balls to use as test objects. If both of them break before you determine the answer then you have failed at your task. What is the order of floors that you should drop the balls from to minimize the number of droppings that you will have to make to determine the answer?
Assume that if a ball doesn't break you can reuse it without worrying about it being weakened.",,"If the proper order is chosen, you can determine the breaking point with a maximum of 14 drops.  Here's how to do it:
First drop the first ball from the 14th floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with the other ball in at most 13 more droppings, starting at the bottom and going up one floor at a time.
If the first ball survives the 14 floor drop then drop it again from the 27th (14+13) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 12 more droppings.
If the first ball survives the 27 floor drop then drop it again from the 39th (14+13+12) floor. If it breaks you can determine the exact breaking point with at most 11 more droppings.
Keep repeating this process always going up one less floor than the last dropping until the first ball breaks. If it breaks on the xth dropping you will only need at most 14-x more droppings with the second ball to find the breaking point. By the 11th dropping of the first ball, if you get that far, you will have reached the 99th floor.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 11  
Steps:  
1. Set the goal: find a dropping schedule whose worst-case requires no more than 14 drops with two balls.  
2. Adopt the “decreasing interval” strategy: after each safe drop, go up one floor fewer than the previous jump (Δ14, then 13, then 12, …, then 1).  
3. Justify the choice of the initial jump size 14 because 14+13+12+…+1 = 105 ≥ 100, so this pattern can cover all 100 floors within 14 total drops.  
4. First test: drop Ball 1 from the 14th floor.  
5. If Ball 1 breaks at 14, use Ball 2 to check floors 1-13 one at a time (worst-case 13 more drops, giving 14 total).  
6. If Ball 1 survives 14, make the second Ball 1 drop from the 27th floor (14 + 13).  
7. If Ball 1 breaks at 27, linearly test floors 15-26 with Ball 2 (at most 12 more drops, total still 14).  
8. If Ball 1 survives 27, make the third Ball 1 drop from the 39th floor (14 + 13 + 12) and continue in the same pattern.  
9. Continue Ball 1 drops at floors 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, and 99, each time reducing the increment by 1.  
10. Whenever Ball 1 finally breaks on its x-th drop, the remaining search range is at most 14 − x floors, so Ball 2 can finish in at most 14 − x additional drops.

40,"On an otherwise deserted and isolated island, 200 perfect logicians are stranded. The islanders are perfectly logical in every decision they make, and they will not do anything unless they are absolutely certain of the outcome. However, they cannot communicate with each other. They are forbidden from speaking with one another, or signing, or writing messages in the sand, else they be smited by the god of the island.
Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no individual knows what color their own eyes are. There are no reflective surfaces on the island for the inhabitants to see a reflection of their own eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or perhaps another color entirely. And remember, they cannot communicate with each other in any way under penalty of death.
Each night, when a ship comes, the islanders have a chance to leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an islander tells the captain of the ship the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.
Now, there is one more person on the island: the guru, who the islanders know to always tell the truth. The guru has green eyes. One day, she stands up before all 200 islanders and says:
""I see a person with blue eyes.""
Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?",What would happen if there was only one blue-eyed person on the island and the rest of the islanders were brown-eyed? What about two? What about three?,"All 100 blue-eyed people leave on the 100th night. First, we propose that two blue-eyed people are on the island. They would both leave on the second night, because they would each look at the other blue-eyed person on the second morning and realize that the only reason the other blue-eyed person wouldn't leave on the first night is because they see another person with blue eyes. Seeing no one else with blue eyes, each of these two people realize it must be them. Now consider the case of three blue-eyed islanders. It has been established that if only two people had blue eyes they would leave on the second night. You, the third blue-eyed person in our example, know this, as do the other two blue-eyed people. So when you wake up on the third morning, and the two other blue-eyed people have not left, you know that they must see another person with blue eyes, and you can see that no one else on the island has blue eyes, so you know it must be you. All three of you realize this simultaneously, and all three leave on the third night. If a fourth blue-eyed person is on the island, he will reason the scenario with three blue-eyed people on the island, and when he sees that they have not left the island during the fourth morning, he/she/it will leave the island on the fourth day, and so will all the other blue-eyed people. If we follow this pattern, we will eventually reach the answer of 100 people leaving the island after 100 days.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6  
Steps:  
1. The guru’s public statement “I see a person with blue eyes” becomes common knowledge, so every islander now knows (and knows that everyone else knows, etc.) that at least one blue-eyed person exists.  

2. Base case: If there were exactly one blue-eyed islander, that person would see no other blue eyes, combine this with the guru’s statement, deduce their own eyes are blue, and leave on the first night.  

3. Two-person case: Suppose there are exactly two blue-eyed islanders. Each sees one blue-eyed person and, using Step 2, expects that lone person to leave on night 1.

5. Inductive pattern: Extending the same reasoning, if there are k blue-eyed islanders, their departure will be delayed until night k; the failure of the (k − 1) blue-eyed scenario to materialize on the preceding morning lets each of them deduce they are the k-th blue-eyed person.

41,"In a forest somewhere in Scotland lives a group of 100 dwarves. Each night they meet in the middle of the forest for a grand feast.  When morning comes, they all go home.  Each dwarf is wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. Curiously, there are no mirrors in the forest, so no dwarf knows the color of his own hat. A dwarf would never take off his hat to see its color, and a major dwarf faux pas is to comment on the color of another dwarf's hat.  The dwarves know, however, that there is at least one red hatted dwarf and one blue hatted dwarf. One day, the master dwarf announces that the nightly feast will only be intended for blue hatted dwarves, and as soon as a dwarf knows that he is wearing a red hat, he should not come back the next day, and he should never return.
How many days does it take before there are no dwarves left with red hats at the party? (Assume all the dwarves are equally capable of figuring it out, in other words, there are no smart dwarves, and no stupid dwarves...)",The number of days depends on the number of red hats.,"It will take one more day than the number of dwarves with red hats.
How this works is: assume that there is only one red-hatted dwarf. He would go to the party only to see 99 blue hats. He knows that there is at least one red hat. Since all he sees is blue, he knows it must be him, so he knows not to come back the next day. Meanwhile, the blue hatted dwarves can only see one red hat, so they think that if he comes back tomorrow, then he must have seen another red hat.  Since each blue hatted dwarf only sees one red hat, he would assume that if the red hatted dwarf came back tomorrow, then he must be the other red hat that the first red hatted dwarf saw. So the second day, all the blue hatted dwarves would come expecting to see if the red hatted dwarf came back. Which he wouldn't, because he knows he has a red hat. So the first day there are no dwarves with red hats is day 2, or one day more than the number of dwarves with red hats.
If there were two dwarves with red hats, each red hatted dwarf would realize on the second day that he was wearing a red hat, because he would see that the other red hat had come back, and that means that he must have seen another red hat. Since the red hats would see 98 blue hats, they would know on the second day, and the third day would be the first day that no red hatted dwarves came to the feast. This same system works for any number of red hats, because each time a blue hatted dwarf is thinking that if the red hats come back tomorrow, then he must have a red hat, the red hatted dwarves already know, and so they don't come the next day.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  
Steps:  
1. Let R denote the (unknown) number of red-hatted dwarves; claim that the first feast with no red hats will occur on day R + 1.  
2. Base case R = 1: the sole red-hatted dwarf sees 99 blue hats, knows from the announcement that at least one red hat exists, concludes it must be his, and therefore decides not to attend the next feast.  
3. Because that dwarf stays away the following night, the second feast (day 2) is already red-free; thus the claim holds for R = 1 (it took 1 + 1 = 2 days).  
4. Case R = 2: each red-hatted dwarf sees exactly one red hat; assuming himself blue, he predicts that dwarf would leave after the first night (the R = 1 logic). When both reds still appear at the second feast, each realizes his assumption was wrong and that he, too, is red.  
5. Both red-hatted dwarves now stay away, so the third feast (day 3) is the first without any red hats; hence the claim holds for R = 2 (2 + 1 = 3 days).  
6. Inductive step: assume the claim holds for every number of red hats less than k. With R = k, each red-hatted dwarf sees k − 1 red hats; if he were blue, the inductive hypothesis says those k − 1 reds would all stay away after k − 1 days, making the k-th feast red-free.  
7.

The First Lap:
Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica took off sprinting taking the top 4 spots. Felicia and Brianna aren't far behind though. Kelsey, Anna and Abby were bringing up the back as they had a late start.
In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people were doing the best and the top ranked person was doing the worst. The Major was in 6th place as Brianna passed her for 5th. Luke was just about to pass Felicia, but tripped and fell back to 9th place as Clark and Brad passed him in that order. The back three girls were in their places according to their rank, the highest rank being 10th place and the lowest rank being 12th place.
The Second Lap:
Paul slipped on a water puddle and fell back to third place, leaving the person he was right by, way in front. Clark moved up 2 spots, pushing those two people back one place each. Then, Felicia and Anna switched places, and Luke and Brad switched places. The people in 11th and 12th ended up switching places just before the third lap as well.
The Third Lap:
The two people in 10th and 11th place switched spots, the two people in 5th and 6th places switched spots, and the two people in 7th and 8th places switched spots. Brad ended up getting passed by the two people directly behind him, and Jessica was passed by the person directly behind her. Everyone then finished in the order that they are currently in.
Can you figure out which place everyone is in, and what rank they will be after this race?",,"The Order the finished in was: Ben, Paul, Jessica, Stephen, Brianna, Clark, Luke, Anna, Kelsey, Felicia, Brad, Abby.
Here is how they got there:
On the first lap the top 4 runners were Stephen, Ben, Paul, and Jessica. Felicia and Brianna weren't far behind which means they were in 5th and 6th place. With Kelsey, Anna, and Abby in the back (10th, 11th, and 12th places), that means Luke, Brad, and Clark were in 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the top 4 runners, the bottom two ranked people are Ben and Paul, which means that they were in 1st and 2nd, and the top ranked person was doing the worst, Stephen, which means that he was in 4th putting Jessica in 3rd place. Brianna was in 5th place, and Major Felicia was in 6th place. Clark and Brad passed Luke in a certain order, making Clark 7th, Brad 8th, and Luke 9th. The three girls in back then were in their places according to their rank, so that put Anna in 10th, Abby in 11th, and Kelsey in 12th. So, now we know what place everyone is after this lap.
On the second lap Paul slipped and was passed by Jessica, putting Ben in 1st, Jessica in 2nd, and Paul in 3rd. Clark moved up 2 spots putting him in 5th place, Brianna in 6th place, and Felicia in 7th place. Felicia then switched places with Anna, which put Felicia in 10th place, and Anna in 7th place. Luke and Brad switched places as well, which put Luke in 8th, and Brad in 9th. The 11th and 12th place people switched places too, which put Kelsey in 11th, and Abby in 12th.
On the third lap the 10th and 11th place people switched spots, putting Kelsey in 10th, and Felicia in 11th. 5th and 6th place switched, making Brianna in 5th, and Clark in 6th, and the 7th and 8th place people switched, putting Luke in 7th and Anna in 8th. Brad was passed by the two people who were directly behind him which made Kelsey in 9th, Felicia in 10th, and Brad in 11th. Jessica was also passed by Paul, the person directly behind her, putting Paul in 2nd, and Jessica in 3rd.

5. I is not 1.",,"A=7, B=1, C=9
D=6, E=2, F=8
G=4, H=5, I=3
From Clue 2, E must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it cannot be 5 or 7 because that would force G to be a greater multiple of 5 or 7, and only the numbers 1 to 9 are used. E must be 2 or 3 and G must be 4, 6, 8, or 9.
Let's try I=2. In that case, E=3 and G=6. H must be greater than 6 because of Clue 4. The most G+H+I can be is 14 because of Clue 1, since the sum of all nine numbers is only 45. So, I cannot be 2, and it therefore must be at least 3 because of Clue 5.
If I=4, then G cannot be 4, and must be 6, 8, or 9. Again, since H must be greater than G, the bottom row's sum will be too high.  If I = 5, then the minimums for G and H would be 4 and 6, respectively -- a sum of 15. If I = 6, then the minimum sum again is 15.
This means I MUST be 3, which forces E=2 and G=4, 6, or 8.  If G is 6 or 8, the sum of the bottom row will be too great, so G=4. The greatest that H can be is 7, which also means that B can only be 1, 2, or 3, from Clue 4. But 2 and 3 are already used, so B=1 and H=5.
This leaves A, C, D, and F, to be paired with 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order. We know from Clue 1 that A+B+C > D+E+F, but E is already 1 greater than B, and from Clue 3, we know that F > A. This means that C must be at least 3 greater than D to make up for the top row trailing by at least 2. So, C must be 9, and D must be 6. This leaves 7 and 8 to be A and F, so of course, F=8 and A=7.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  

Steps:  
1. Use Clue 2 (E is a prime factor of G).  
   • E can only be 2, 3, 5, 7.  
   • 5 or 7 are impossible (they would force G > 9), so E is 2 or 3.  
   • Therefore G is limited to 4, 6, 8, 9.  

2. Test I = 2 (smallest unused value ≥ 2).  
   • Forces E = 3 and G = 6.  
   • Then H = B + G > 6, so G + H + I > 14.  
   • This contradicts Clue 1 (bottom-row sum would exceed the allowed range).  
   • Conclude I ≠ 2, so I ≥ 3.  

3. Eliminate I = 4, 5, 6 in turn.  
   • Each choice requires G ≥ 6 and H > G, giving a bottom-row minimum sum of 15, again violating Clue 1.  
   • Hence the only possible value is I = 3.  

4. With I = 3, force E = 2 (only prime factor left) and keep G ∈ {4, 6, 8}.  
   • If G = 6 or 8, H must be > G, making the bottom-row sum too large.  
   • Therefore G = 4.  

5. Apply Clue 4 (B + G = H) with G = 4.  
   • The bottom-row sum cap forces H ≤ 7, so B can be 1, 2, or 3.  
   • 2 and 3 are already used, so B = 1 and H = 5.  

6. Remaining numbers {6, 7, 8, 9} go to A, C, D, F.  
   • Clue 1: (A + B + C) > (D + E + F).

   • Choose C = 9 and D = 6 to satisfy that gap.  
   • Clue 3 requires F > A. The only remaining pair {7, 8} can meet this with F = 8 and A = 7.

46,"The boffins from NASA have received and decoded a digital message from the Galactic Council, informing them that four alien ambassadors from the solar system are due to visit Earth in the next 24 hours. The aliens are Agurgle from Uranus, Wym-Inar from Venus, ChimChim from Pluto and Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn. 24 hours later, they receive a mystery message saying that if any alien comes off the ship that is green, tentacled and slimy, then they are actually an undercover assassin from Neptune. By then, however, the aliens have all landed and are in adjacent decontamination booths, waiting to be let in to NASA Headquarters. One alien turns out to be green, tentacled and slimy!
From the clues below, who is the Neptunian Assassin?
1) Wym-Inar from Venus is the only ambassador in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien.
2). Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle from Uranus.
3) ChimChim from Pluto is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one Un-slimy alien.
Who do the NASA boffins not let out of the booth?",Don't get too confused with the Un-slimy bit.,"ChimChim from Pluto is green, tentacled and slimy and so, is the Assassin.
Looking at clue 2 we know that both the ambassadors standing next to Agurgle from Uranus are not green. Also, from the body of the teaser, we also know only one alien is green, tentacled and slimy. So there are two deductions to be made: (Note the key is - Alien (Green, Tentacled, Un-Slimey). Where ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. ""?"" denotes unknown, and each set of braces[] indicates a booth)
Either Deduction A
[ N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [ N, ?, ?] [ ?, ?, ?]
Or Deduction B
[N, ?, ?] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, ?][ N, ?, ?] [Y, Y, N]
You can see that either Agurgle from Uranus or the alien at the extreme right hand booth is green, tentacled and slimy.
Now taking clue 3, you can work out that ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to a slimy alien AND each of the other aliens' booths are next to precisely one slimy alien.
So, based on the first set of deductions, you can infer the following.
Deduction A (ii):
[ChimChim from Pluto N, ?, N] [Agurgle from Uranus Y, Y, N] [N, ?, Y] [?, ?, Y]
Or Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
You can then use clue 1 to eliminate one of these deductions: Wym-Inar from Venus is the only alien in a booth next to exactly one tentacled alien. But in Deduction A(ii), ChimChim from Pluto's booth is next to exactly one tentacled alien.  Therefore, Deduction A (ii) is not possible and Deduction B (ii) is the correct one.
Deduction B (ii):
[N, ?, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus ?, ?, Y][ N, ?, N] [ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
So, looking again at clues 2 and 3, there are a further 2 possible deductions to be made.
Deduction A (iii)
[Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, Y] [Agurgle from Uranus] [?, N, Y] [Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]
Deduction B (iii)
[Wym-Inar from Venus N, N, Y][Agurgle from Uranus ?, Y, Y][Mr. Arthur Johnson from Saturn N, N, N][ChimChim from Pluto Y, Y, N]

Steps:  
1. Use clue 2 (“Two of the ambassadors who are not green, are each in booths next to Agurgle”) together with the fact that only one alien is green to see that the green alien cannot be in either booth that borders Agurgle.  
   • Therefore the single green alien must be either Agurgle himself or the ambassador at the far (right-hand) end of the row of four booths.  
   • Set up two provisional layouts:

2. Bring in clue 3 (“ChimChim is the only ambassador not in a booth next to exactly one un-slimy alien”).

47,"MADADIA has been chosen to host the latest United Nations Kebab Annual Liaisons (U.N.K.A.L).
Madadia's mayoress, Madka Owdiseez, has invited several wives of delegates of UNKAL for an informal luncheon.
She plans to seat her 9 guests in a row such that each lady will be able to converse with the person directly to her left and right. She has prepared the following list.
Mrs. F speaks English only.
Mrs. G speaks English and French.
Mrs. H speaks English and Russian.
Mrs. J speaks Russian only.
Mrs. K speaks English only.
Mrs. L speaks French only.
Mrs. M speaks French and German.
Mrs. N speaks English and German.

How many distinct seating arrangements are possible? Give all possible seating arrangements. Bear in mind that Madka Owdiseez is not one of the 9 to be seated in a row.
Note that ABCD and DCBA are the same",,"With each arrangement considered identical to its reverse, there are 126 possible arrangements.
FKO are interchangeable, and can be arranged 6 ways. FKO stays together unless N is next to M outside GLM (more on that below).
JH must be together, and J must be at the end, because H is the only other Russian speaker. JH has 2 slots in the above configuration (H next to FKO, with J on the outside).
GLM has 1 slot in the above configuration (G next to FKO, opposite JH).
2[JH]*6[FKO]*1[MLG]=12 arrangements, or 2 mirror groups of 6 arrangements each. Thus, 6 distinct arrangements - 1 for each FKO order.
Keeping the above groups self-contained, N has 5 slots (2 within FKO, 1 between FKO and H, 1 between FKO and G, 1 beside M). That makes 30 arrangements - 5 for each FKO order.
When N is in certain positions, however, the groups can break up. Unless N is next to M outside GLM, GLM can be GML. If N is between FKO and GLM, GLM can scramble, and G can be anywhere touching FKO, except N cannot touch L. When G-[L/M]-N are consecutive in either direction, FKO can straddle that subgroup. That makes 126 arrangements - 21 for each FKO order.

Steps:  
1. Group the three ladies who speak only English – F, K and O – into one contiguous block; note that there are 3 ! = 6 internal orders for this FKO block.  

2. Recognise that the only two Russian speakers are J and H, so they must sit next to each other; because no one else speaks Russian, J has to be on an end seat with H immediately inside. Hence the ordered pair (J H) can be positioned at either end of the row (2 possibilities).  

3. The remaining pure-French speaker L and the bilingual French speakers G and M must form a block that can attach to English via G.  In the initial counting pass that block is fixed as (G L M) and is placed on the opposite side of the FKO block from (J H).  Thus there is only 1 slot for (G L M).  

4. Combine the counts so far: 2 positions for (J H) × 6 internal permutations of FKO × 1 position for (G L M) = 12 linear arrangements; since each arrangement is regarded the same as its reverse, this yields 12 / 2 = 6 distinct arrangements at this stage.  

5. Insert N (who speaks English and German).  While the previous three blocks stay intact, N can be inserted in five different places: (i) either of the two internal gaps inside FKO, (ii) between FKO and H, (iii) between FKO and G, or (iv) next to M on the French–German side.

The remaining pure-French speaker L and the bilingual French speakers G and M must form a block that can attach to English via G.

48,"Four men are in a line at the Madadian Police station, charged with unlicensed kebab breeding.
The men are Mad Ade, Buster Artery, Cliff Hedge and Donny Moe - and they are standing in a straight line.
One man is fair, handsome and unscarred.
Two men who are not fair, are each standing next to Mad Ade
Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man.
Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Who is fair, handsome and unscarred?",,"Cliff Hedge is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (2), both the men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair. Also, exactly one man is fair, handsome and unscarred. Hence, there are two cases:
Case 1 :: ? (N, ?, ?) : Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) : ? (N, ?, ?) : ? (?, ?, ?)
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, ?) : Mad Ade (?, ?, ?) : ? (N, ?, ?) : ? (Y, Y, N)
Note the representation - Name (Fair, Handsome, Scarred). ""Y"" stands for Yes and ""N"" stands for No. Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) means Mad Ade is Fair, Handsome and Unscarred.(oh, how true this is..NOT)
It is clear that either Mad Ade or the man at the extreme right is fair, handsome and unscarred.
From (4), it is deduced that Cliff Hedge is standing next to unscarred man and each of the other men standing next to exactly one scarred man.
Case 1 :: Cliff Hedge (N, ?, N) : Mad Ade (Y, Y, N) : ? (N, ?, Y) : ? (?, ?, Y)
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, Y) : Mad Ade (?, ?, Y) : ? (N, ?, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
From (3), Buster Artery is the only man standing next to exactly one handsome man. But in Case 1, Cliff Hedge is standing next to exactly one handsome man. Hence, Case 1 is not possible and Case 2 is the correct one.
Case 2 :: ? (N, ?, Y) : Mad Ade (?, ?, Y) : ? (N, ?, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
Again from (3) and (4), there are 2 possibilities as shown below.
Case 2a :: Donny Moe (N, N, Y) : Mad Ade (?, N, Y) : Buster Artery (N, N, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)
Case 2b :: Buster Artery (N, N, Y) : Mad Ade (?, Y, Y) : Donny Moe (N, N, N) : Cliff Hedge (Y, Y, N)

Steps:  
1. Establish notation for each man’s three attributes (Fair, Handsome, Scarred) and note that exactly one man is Fair + Handsome + Un-scarred.  From clue (2), both men standing next to Mad Ade are not fair, so the single Fair + Handsome + Un-scarred man must be either Mad Ade himself or the man on the extreme right; this yields two positional cases to examine (Case 1 and Case 2).

3. Apply clue (4) (“Cliff Hedge is the only man not standing next to exactly one scarred man”).

A Police line up of 11 suspects was made to stand in a straight line to have an Identity Parade. The main culprit was asked to stand in the center of the line-up.
1) Barb Dwyre and Chris Mass stood to the right of the main culprit
2) Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Lou Stooth
3) Seven suspects stood between Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits
4) Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst
5) Robin Banks and Polly Ester-Phants stood either side of Ewan Watarmy
6) Diddy Dewit and Polly Ester-Phants stood to the left of the main culprit
7) Six suspects stood between Chris Mass and Ewan Watarmy
8) Two suspects stood between Ewan Watarmy and Diddy Dewit
Who is the main culprit?
Can you tell the positions of all the suspects?",,"Suspects from left to right: Diddy Dewit, (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), Ewan Watarmy, (Robin Banks/Polly Ester-Phants), HUGO PHURST, Lou Stooth, (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Barb Dwyre/Gerry Atrick), (Mike Rhosopht/Phil Mypokits), Chris Mass
Let's number the positions 1 to 11 from left to right. Hence, the main culprit is at position 6. Now, looking at the clues 7, 5, 2 and 8 together:
Position 1 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth
Position 3 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 4 - Ewan Watarmy
Position 5 - Polly Ester-Phants or Robin Banks
Position 7 - Diddy Dewit or Lou Stooth

From clue (3), the only possible positions for Mike Rhosopht and Phil Mypokits are Position 2 and Position 10.
Now there are 3 positions remaining - 6, 8 and 9 and remaining 3 suspects are Hugo Phurst, Barb Dwyre and Gerry Atrick. But from clue (1), Barb Dwyre stood to the right of the main culprit i.e. Barb Dwyre must be on position 8 or 9 as position 6 is for the main culprit. So either Hugo Phurst or Gerry Atrick is the main culprit.
From (4), Gerry Atrick stood to the right of Hugo Phurst. Hence, Hugo Phurst is the main culprit.

52,"In a wood-cutting factory, five large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are five back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all five machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the five switches outside the room to the five machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?","Aside from sight, use other senses.","1) Turn off two machines while inside. Let's call those two machines turned off with inside switch 'inactive', and call remaining three machines 'active'.
2) Go outside.
3) Find out which two outside switches correspond to inactive machines, and which correspond to active machines.

Boris Paley, liar

Neither set of brothers consists entirely of liars (introduction), so neither consists entirely of truthtellers, either.  Boris, then, can't be telling the truth (clue 2); Boris is a liar.  If Alan lies, then Chuck tells the truth (clue 3), and vice versa, so between Alan and Chuck, one is a liar and one a truthteller.  By elimination, Dalman, Edwin, and Finney are, in some order, one liar and two truthtellers.  If Finney is a liar, so is Edwin (clue 6), which is impossible; so Finney tells the truth and so does Edwin (Clue 6); Dalman, then, is a liar.  Boris is a Paley (clue 7).  Edwin is a Paley (clue 5).  Chuck and Dalman are not brothers (clue 4), so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson; by elimination, Alan and Finney are both Thomsons.  Finney Thomson tells the truth, so Alan Thomson is a liar (clue 1) and Chuck is a truthteller (clue 3).  Boris Paley lied when he said both of his brothers tell the truth (clue 2); one of his brothers is Edwin Paley, a truthteller, so the other must be a liar - and therefore the third Paley can't be Chuck, a truthteller, so must be Dalman, a liar.  By elimination, Chuck is a Thompson.

Steps:  
1. Because neither set of brothers is entirely made up of liars, neither set can be made up entirely of truthtellers.  
2. If Boris were truthful, his claim that both his brothers tell the truth would make his whole family truthful, contradicting Step 1; therefore Boris is a liar.  
3. Chuck says “Alan and Boris are both liars,” so Alan and Chuck must have opposite truth-values—exactly one of them is a liar.  
4. With Boris already a liar and exactly one liar among {Alan, Chuck}, the remaining three men {Dalman, Edwin, Finney} must contribute exactly one more liar (for a total of three liars overall).  
5. If Finney were a liar, his statement “Edwin tells the truth” would force Edwin to be a liar too, giving two liars in the trio of Step 4, which is impossible; hence Finney is a truthteller.  
6. Because Finney is truthful, Edwin really does tell the truth, so Edwin is also a truthteller and Dalman becomes the single liar needed in that trio.  
7. Finney’s other true statement “Boris is one of the Paleys” puts Boris in the Paley family.  
8. Edwin’s true statement “Boris and I are brothers” means Edwin is a Paley as well.  
9. Dalman’s false claim “Chuck and I are brothers” shows Chuck and Dalman are not brothers, so one is a Paley and the other a Thomson.  
10. With Boris and Edwin already Paleys, exactly one more Paley is needed; therefore either Dalman or Chuck is that Paley, which forces Alan and Finney to be Thomsons.  
11. Finney is a truthful Thomson; from Step 3 Alan must be the liar in the Alan-Chuck pair, forcing Chuck to be the truthteller.  
12. Boris’s false claim that both his brothers tell the truth is satisfied by having one truthful brother (Edwin) and one lying brother, so Dalman (liar) must be the third Paley and Chuck is consequently a Thomson.

55,"A canal in UK has 13 locks and no water supply at the top.
Each lock loses 7000 L of water when used.
A truck capable of carrying 22 tons of water is rented to bring water from the bottom to the top.
Is the contract reasonable, and why?",Where are the water losses?,"At first thought:
We could think that 13 x 7,000 litres = 91,000 litres that would be lost, against 22 tons.
22 tons equal 22,000 Litres (1 ton of water = 1000 kg = 1000 litres = 1 m3).
So we would lose 91,000 litres to gain 22,000 litres: contract is not worth it.
On second thought:
Certainly, each lock loses 7,000 litres, but it takes the water from the level above!
Hence, by succession, we only lose 7,000 litres from the top level, no matter how many locks we have!
The balance, then, is 22,000 litres - 7,000 litres = 15,000 litres: the contract is worth it!
On third thought (the engineering approach):
Unfortunately, waterways ""lose"" water in a continuous manner: by evaporation, by ""leaks"" to the underground water table, by ""leaks"" through the locks.
Now come two more factors: the length of the canal (which determines the evaporation and leaks to underground), and the TIME it takes to bring the water upstream.
If the whole of the canal loses 3,000 litres/hour and it takes the boat 5 hours to reach the top, the exercise is pointless (just maintaining the levels).  Less time, and it is worth it.  More time, and it is worthless.
On fourth thought (the economics):
If the engineering balance is ""close to equilibrium"", economics may make the exercise worthwhile, by careful planning of the traffic on the canal, i.e. making every lock crossing with TWO boats: one up, one down.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  
Steps:  
1. Make the naïve calculation that every one of the 13 locks removes 7 000 L from the canal, giving a total loss of 13 × 7 000 = 91 000 L for one boat passage.  
2. Compare this 91 000 L loss with the truck’s payload of 22 000 L (22 t) and conclude, on that basis, that hauling water would not be worthwhile.  
3. Correct the hydraulic reasoning: each lock draws its 7 000 L from the pound immediately above it, so only the highest pound actually loses water to the outside world; thus a single passage needs just 7 000 L of “new” water at the summit.  
4. Re-evaluate the balance: the truck delivers 22 000 L while only 7 000 L are lost at the summit, yielding a net gain of 22 000 − 7 000 = 15 000 L, so—in this ideal picture—the contract looks favorable.  
5. Introduce real-world (“engineering”) losses that occur continuously along the canal—evaporation, seepage and lock leakage—so the net benefit depends on travel time and canal length.  
6. Illustrate with an example (e.g., 3 000 L / h loss, 5 h trip) showing that 3 000 × 5 = 15 000 L can erase the previously calculated gain, meaning the decision hinges on whether travel time is short enough.

56,"There was a new and very popular Emperor in a small country in the Pacific Ocean.  The country consisted of two small islands 3 miles apart.  The only way to get to the other island was an old, small ferry boat. The new Emperor was very progressive and wanted to shape up the community to attract tourists and hopefully new residents to stop the population from shrinking.
He decided to connect the islands by a new bridge.  Everyone knew the job would be difficult and dangerous, and when he put out the word only two companies were even willing to attempt it.
Company A was the first to offer and said they could do it for $800,000.  When the Emperor told the contractor of Company B what Company A offered, the contractor of Company B said they could not do it for less than $1,000,000. The Emperor took a while to think it over.  Contractor B, being very smart and confident, came back to the Emperor and said, ""Sir, I will give you an offer you cannot refuse.  The decision is completely up to you in the end, but you can pay me $200,000, $750,000, or $1,000,000 for the job.""  Contractor B proceeded with his details and the Emperor immediately accepted his offer.  Company B ended up being paid $1,000,000 for the job. Contractor B did not lie, cheat, or swindle the Emperor in any way.  He is a very honest businessman.
Why did Company B's offer sound so good to the Emperor, and more importantly, how did Company B end up with the highest amount?","2 Hints:
1. Company A is part of Company B's idea.
2. Use your math and accounting skills","Contractor B was very confident in his company's excellent work. It was high quality work so could not lower the full price to under $1,000,000.  He suggested to the Emperor that each company start building from opposite ends and each complete a quarter of the bridge.  The emperor could then examine the 2 quarters and make his decision on which company would complete the job, based off of quality.
Each company would be paid $200,000 for their quarter, that way if Company A won, the emperor would still only be paying $800,000 ($400,000 more to Company A for the rest of the bridge).  If Company B won, Contractor B argued, it would be because they were obviously superior in bridge building and thus worthy of the extra money.  The Emperor would still only be paying $950,000 that way anyway, which is still cheaper than Company B's full offer, while Company B would still get paid their full ¾ pay for ¾ of a bridge ($750,000).
When Company A heard this offer, they knew they were beat because they knew their bridge-building skills were far inferior.  They figured it was not worth the $200,000 to start even building since it was so dangerous and immediately backed out, forcing the Emperor to pay Company B their full asking price of $1,000,000.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8

2. B’s scheme: each company starts at opposite shores and builds the first quarter of the bridge; each is paid \$200 000 for that initial quarter.

Steps:  
1. Record all conditions in positional form ①–⑩ and note that each digit 0–9 is used once.  
2. “The product of the 5th and 10th positions is odd” ⇒ both ⑤ and ⑩ are odd digits {1,3,5,7,9}.  
3. From the size-chain ⑧ > ⑥ > ② > ⑤ > ⑦ we know ⑧ and ⑥ must be comparatively large and ⑤, ⑦ comparatively small.  
4. “The 9th position is even” ⇒ ⑨ ∈ {0,2,4,6,8}.  “4th + 9th = 10th (odd)” forces one addend even and one odd; since ⑨ is even, ④ must be odd and ⑩ (their sum) stays odd – consistent with step 2.  
5. “3rd + 4th = 6th × 9th.”  Because ④ is odd and ⑨ even, ⑥ × ⑨ is even, so ③ must be odd to make an even + odd = even equality work; therefore ③ is odd.  
6. With ④ odd and ⑨ even, enumerate even ⑨ possibilities (0,2,4,6,8) and compute feasible odd ④ so that ④ + ⑨ remains an odd digit (≤9) for ⑩; only the pair (⑨,④,⑩) = (4,5,9) survives all uniqueness and size constraints.  
7. Fixing ⑨ = 4 and ④ = 5 gives ⑩ = 9.  Now “3rd + 4th = 6th × 9th” becomes ③ + 5 = ⑥ × 4.  The right side is a multiple of 4; testing unused digits shows the only solution is ⑥ = 3 and ③ = 7.  
8. Apply “The sum of the 2nd, 6th, and 9th numbers is a perfect square” with ⑥ = 3 and ⑨ = 4 ⇒ ② + 3 + 4 must be 9 or 16.  With unused digits, only ② = 2 gives ② + 3 + 4 = 9, a perfect square.  
9. Check the size-chain now: ⑧ > 3 > 2 > ⑤ > ⑦ – still to be assigned but must honour this ordering.  
10. Digits left unused are {0,1,6,8}.  To satisfy ⑧ > 3 and ⑥ > ② already met, choose the largest remaining even digit for ⑧, namely 6; this also keeps ⑧ even as the earlier pattern suggested.  
11. With ⑧ = 6 the chain forces ⑤ and ⑦ to come from {0,1}.  Because ⑤ must exceed ⑦, set ⑤ = 1 and ⑦ = 0.  
12. Only digit 8 remains; place it in the sole unfilled slot ①.  Finally verify the last rule “① + ⑤ = ⑦ + ⑩” ⇒ 8 + 1 = 0 + 9 (both 9), and re-check every earlier condition – all are satisfied, giving the code: 8 2 7 5 1 3 0 6 4 9.",,12,"['Total Step Count: 12  \n', '  \n1.

Apply “The sum of the 2nd, 6th, and 9th numbers is a perfect square” with ⑥ = 3 and ⑨ = 4 ⇒ ② + 3 + 4 must be 9 or 16.  With unused digits, only ② = 2 gives ② + 3 + 4 = 9, a perfect square.  \n9. Check the size-chain now: ⑧ > 3 > 2 > ⑤ > ⑦ – still to be assigned but must honour this ordering.  \n10. Digits left unused are {0,1,6,8}.  To satisfy ⑧ > 3 and ⑥ > ② already met, choose the largest remaining even digit for ⑧, namely 6; this also keeps ⑧ even as the earlier pattern suggested.  \n11. With ⑧ = 6 the chain forces ⑤ and ⑦ to come from {0,1}.  Because ⑤ must exceed ⑦, set ⑤ = 1 and ⑦ = 0.  \n12. Only digit 8 remains; place it in the sole unfilled slot ①.  Finally verify the last rule “① + ⑤ = ⑦ + ⑩” ⇒ 8 + 1 = 0 + 9 (both 9), and re-check every earlier condition – all are satisfied, giving the code: 8 2 7 5 1 3 0 6 4 9.']"
58,"A group of Mad-Ade's friends, although fewer than 10, found a number of Golden kebab tokens which they were able to divide equally among them.
After this division had been done, Norha Bone - one of the friends, suggested that it would be more equitable to divide the Golden kebab tokens by families rather than by individuals. Among them, there were two groups with two sisters; of course Norha Bone was not in either group. The rest of the friends were unrelated to each other. A re-division by families would have meant that the Golden kebab tokens per family were 5 more than the Golden kebab tokens per friend.
The friends argued among themselves over this way of dividing the Golden kebab tokens. Before a final decision is made, Wendy Boatkumsin - one of the friends, decided that she did not want any Golden kebab tokens. Her share was equally divided (without breaking/cutting any Kebab token) among the other friends.
Finally, Norha Bone decided to withdraw her suggestion of dividing the Golden kebab tokens by families.
How many friends were there and how many Golden kebab tokens did each friend end up with?",,"There were a total of 6 friends. Each end up with 12 Golden kebab tokens.
The number of Golden kebab tokens is evenly divisible by the number of friends as well as the number of families.
Let's assume that N is the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend received initially and G is the total number of friends.
Then, total number of Golden kebab tokens = NG
If the Golden kebab tokens had been divided by families rather than by individuals, the number of recipients would be (G - 2) and each share would be (N + 5).
Again, total number of Golden kebab tokens = (N + 5)(G - 2)
But, the total number of the Golden kebab tokens is the same.
NG = (N + 5)(G - 2)
NG = NG -2N +5G -10
2N = 5G -10
N = (5/2)G - 5
Now, N and G are the positive integers and also total number of Golden kebab tokens must be divisible by G, (G-1) and (G-2). This is because initially there were G friends; then since it was divided family wise, the total number of units, the coins were to be divided would be (G-2) (as two groups had two sisters, so two friends got combined as one group, one per group); and after Wendy Boatkumsin backed out, there were (G-1) friends.

1. Introduce variables: let N be the number of Golden kebab tokens each friend first received and G (< 10) be the number of friends.  
2. Express the original total number of tokens as NG.  
3. Note that when grouped by families there would be G – 2 recipients (because two pairs of sisters become two families) and each family would receive N + 5 tokens.  
4. Equate the two ways of counting tokens: NG = (N + 5)(G – 2).  
5. Expand and simplify the equation to obtain 2N = 5G – 10, hence N = (5/2)G – 5.  
6. Conclude that N must be an integer, so 5G must be even; therefore G must be even.

8. Test even values of G under 10 that satisfy these divisibility conditions.  
9. Find that G = 6 works: it gives N = 10, total tokens = 60, 60 is divisible by 6, 5, and 4, and the family share is N + 5 = 15.

60,"Hi. My name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of big gardens. In one of them I have hundreds of beautiful, delicious, red flowers.
At my house, my dog is waiting. I have told him about this flower-heaven-garden with hundreds of flowers, and it really wants to find that garden to eat the flowers (yes, my dog eats flowers).
However, this flower-heaven is far away, and my dog wants to go there as soon as possible. It has to travel through some other gardens on its way, but it wants to travel between as few other gardens as possible.
Your mission is to find the best route for my dog, from my house to the flower-heaven. The dog wants to go through as few gardens as possible on its way.
Here are some facts about my gardens:
1. There are two gardens between my (mister Kvakk's) house and the house of my neighbour Quack, if you take the shortest route.
2. The only garden between The lawn and Soria is The field
3. It's one garden between The field and flower-heaven
4. One possible route (but not the shortest) from Kvakk to flower-heaven, is: The pool, Soria, Star, The mountain
5. To go from Kvakk to Quack as fast as possible, you don't need to go through The field, The forest, The angels valley or Star
6. You can go from The forest to The mountain by going through Longo
7. Duck country and The forest are my only two gardens that lie against Quack's house
8. From the garden The field, you can go directly to The lawn, Longo, The pool, Soria, Star and Kvakk's house
9. There are two gardens between Quack and flower-heaven. These are not the same gardens that are between Kvakk and Quack
10. Quack's house is to the east of Kvakk's house
11. Flower-heaven is south-west of Quack's house
12. Except for the two houses and flower-heaven, ten gardens of different size and shape are named in this teaser
13. You can go into flower-heaven from three different gardens
14. If you are at Star, you must go through one garden to come to flower-heaven
15. Star, The lawn, The mountain, The pool, Soria, The forest, Duck Country and the two houses lie beside the sea. It is not possible for the dog to travel through the sea. Luckily, no other gardens lie beside the sea.
16. The angel's valley is between flower-heaven and The forest
Through which gardens should my dog travel?","It's easiest to solve this if you try to draw a kind of map. You should maybe start by using the information points in this order: 1, 10, 7, 9, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8","-You should start by drawing the two houses and the two gardens between them (1).

-From 7 we know that the garden to the left of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 9 and 11 to draw flower-heaven to the south of Quack. The first garden to the south of Quack is either Duck country or The forest
-Use 4 to draw the four gardens The pool, Soria, Star and The mountain between Kvakk and flower-heaven
-From 5 you see that you don't need to go through The forest to go from Kvakk to Quack. Therefore, the garden to the left of Quack must be Duck country. And so on, the garden to the south must be The forest.
-Use 6 to draw in the garden Longo
-And finally, use 8 to draw the garden The field
-By 3 and 13 we know se the solution. The three gardens that lie against flower-haven must be The angels valley, Longo and The mountain.

From fact 1, the first day the two-day man went to the pub was either the 1st or the 2nd of the month, and the first day the three-day man went was either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. But from fact 2, they could not have gone on consecutive days, so from fact 3, the two-day man must have first gone on the 1st and the three-day man must have first gone on the 3rd.

2. Frank went on Wednesday the 1st and every two days thereafter, George went on Friday the 3rd and every three days thereafter, and Edgar went on Monday the 6th and every seven days thereafter.

62,"In a far away land, it was known that if you drank poison, the only way to save yourself is to drink a stronger poison, which neutralizes the weaker poison. The king that ruled the land wanted to make sure that he possessed the strongest poison in the kingdom, in order to ensure his survival, in any situation. So the king called the kingdom's pharmacist and the kingdom's treasurer, he gave each a week to make the strongest poison. Then, each would drink the other one's poison, then his own, and the one that will survive, will be the one that had the stronger poison.
The pharmacist went straight to work, but the treasurer knew he had no chance, for the pharmacist was much more experienced in this field, so instead, he made up a plan to survive and make sure the pharmacist dies. On the last day the pharmacist suddenly realized that the treasurer would know he had no chance, so he must have a plan. After a little thought, the pharmacist realized what the treasurer's plan must be, and he concocted a counter plan, to make sure he survives and the treasurer dies. When the time came, the king summoned both of them. They drank the poisons as planned, and the treasurer died, the pharmacist survived, and the king didn't get what he wanted.
What exactly happened there?",,"The treasurer's plan was to drink a weak poison prior to the meeting with the king, and then he would drink the pharmacist's strong poison, which would neutralize the weak poison.

63,"The Detroit Tigers played the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series (Major League Baseball).  In this particular series (which went the full seven games), there was only one shutout, and no team scored more than 12 runs in any game.  Following are some facts that apply to BOTH teams, individually, pertaining to the number of runs scored in each of the 7 games (no information is given about the order in which these games occured).  For each team, there were:
[1] 4 games with a prime number of runs.
[2] A multiple of 3 games with an even number of runs.
[3] No two games, the product of whose runs was a prime number.
[4] 2 games with a perfect square of runs.
[5] No game with exactly 5 runs.
The Tigers scored 30 runs in the entire series, and [6] scored 7 or 8 runs in at least one game.  The Reds scored 36 runs, and [7] of all seven games, there are exactly two pairs of games, the sum of whose runs was exactly 9 (a game can be used in multiple pairs).
Based on this information, which of these statements is accurate?
1. The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
2. The Cincinnati Reds won the World Series.
3. The World Series winner is uncertain.
The bracketed clue numbers [1]-[7] are used for reference in the answer explanation.",": In baseball, the points are called ""runs,"" and there are no tie games in Major League Baseball.  The World Series is a best-of-seven series of games.  A shutout is a game in which a team is held to 0 runs.  Of course, this entire scenario is hypothetical, and not based upon any actual World Series.","The Detroit Tigers won the World Series.
[2]: Since there were seven games, this must be 0, 3, or 6 games. We know both teams scored an even number of runs in the whole series. This narrows it down from {0, 3, or 6} to 3. So each team had 3 even-run games, and 4 odd-run games.
[3]: The only case in which two whole numbers may be multiplied together to produce a prime number is that one number is 1 and the other is prime. Since one clue mentions that both teams had some prime-number-run games, the statement is shown to be merely an obfuscated way of saying ""there were no games with exactly 1 run for either team.""
[1] and [4]: These clues become very useful when combined, for no number exists that is both a perfect square and a prime number. So for each team, these make up 6 of the 7 games, leaving only one game for each team in which neither a prime number nor a perfect square of runs was scored. Here is the breakdown of the numbers 0 to 12, aside from the eliminated numbers 1 and 5:
Prime - 2,3,7,11 [4 games for each team]
Square - 0,4,9 [2 games each]
Neither prime nor square - 6,8,10,12 [1 game each]
Since all of the ""neither prime nor square"" numbers are even, this leaves 2 even and 4 odd games to make up the 6 ""prime or square"" games for each team. Since we know there was exactly one shutout, one team's square games were either {0,4} or {0,9}, and the other team's square games were either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.
[7]: It can be found that the Reds must have one of the following subsets: {3,6,0,9}, {3,3,6}, {2,2,7}, {2,7,7}, {3,6,2,7}, {2,7,0,9}. {2,7,0,9} is the only one that can be completed legally: {2,7,0,9,3,3,12}.
We now know the Tigers' square games are either {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}. {4,4} is the only one that can be continued legally, which forces their 4 primes to be odd. So Detroit did not score less than 3 in any game, which means the Reds could have won a maximum of just three games: those in which they scored 7, 9, 12.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

Steps:
1. Apply clue [2]: With 7 games, the number of even–run games per team must be a multiple of 3 (0, 3, 6).  Because each team’s total runs are even, only 3 evens are possible, giving every team 3 even-run games and 4 odd-run games.  
2. Interpret clue [3]: A product is prime only when one factor is 1 and the other is prime, so the ban on such products simply forbids any 1-run games for either club.  
3. Combine clues [1] (four primes) and [4] (two perfect squares).  Because no run total is simultaneously prime and a square, each team’s seven scores must be 4 primes + 2 squares + 1 “other.”  Listing 0–12 (excluding 1 and 5) gives: primes {2,3,7,11}, squares {0,4,9}, others {6,8,10,12}.  Thus each team’s lone “other” game is even.  
4. Use the single shut-out fact: only one score of 0 exists.  Therefore the team with the shut-out has square pair {0,4} or {0,9}; the other team’s square pair is one of {4,4}, {4,9}, or {9,9}.  Counting evens/odds (the “other” score is even) keeps every team at 3 evens and 4 odds.  
5. Apply clue [7] to the Reds: exactly two unordered pairs of their seven scores must sum to 9.  Testing the earlier numerical restrictions shows only one legal multiset: {2, 7, 0, 9, 3, 3, 12}, which indeed totals 36 runs and meets all earlier conditions.  
6. Knowing the Reds’ scores fixes the square pair left for Detroit; only {4, 4} works.  Hence all four of Detroit’s prime games must use odd primes (no 2-run Tiger game), so Detroit never scores below 3.  
7. The Reds’ only plausible winning scores are their 7-, 9-, and 12-run games—at most three wins—so Detroit wins at least four games and therefore takes the World Series.",,7,"['Total Step Count: 7\n\n', '\n1.

2. Use clues 1, 2, 5 and 7 to fix the positions of the two mines in row 9 (they must be at E9 and I9), which in turn identifies every other square in row 9 as safe.

66,"There is a ten-digit mystery number (no leading 0), represented by ABCDEFGHIJ, where each numeral, 0 through 9, is used once.  Given the following clues, what is the number?

2) 8 - 3 = 5 - 0 = 5
3) 7 - 4 = 9 - 6 = 3
4) 9 * 3 = 27
A) The sum of the ten digits is 45.  Two digits (A and D) form a two-digit number.  If A and D are 8 and 9, then the remaining eight digits sum to 28.  If A and D are 0 and 1, then the remaining digits sum to 44.  These sums must be split equally between two groups of four digits.  Therefore, each group of four digits must sum to one of the following: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
B) If the sum of each group is 14, then A and D must be a combination of 1 and 4, which sum to 5.  Subtract 5 from 45, leaving 40.  Divide 40 by 2, leaving 20.  20 does not equal 14, so the sum of each group can not be 14.  Repeating the preceding sequence for each of the possible sums leaves only two possible results: 18 (1 + 8 = 9, 45 - 9 = 36, 36 / 2 = 18) and 21 (2 + 1 = 3, 45 - 3 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21).  A must be: 1, 2.  D must be: 1, 8.
C) To satisfy equation #2, B and J must be 3 greater than H and G, respectively.  B and J must each be one of the following: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  H and G must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
D) To satisfy equation #3, C and E must be 5 greater than F and I, respectively.  C and E must each be one of the following: 5, 7, 8, 9.  F and I must each be one of the following: 0, 2, 3, 4.
E) For equation #4, there are six possibilities for B and four possibilities for I, creating 24 possible equations.  Eliminate any equation where A is not 1 or 2.  Eliminate any equation where J is not 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Eliminate any equation where any digit is duplicated.  B must be: 6, 7, 8, 9.  I must be: 2, 3, 4.  J must be: 6, 7, 8.

Steps:  
1. Use the fact that all ten digits sum to 45 and that the two–digit number AD is excluded from the two four-digit groups in clue (1).  Subtract every possible value of AD from 45, split what remains equally, and list every attainable group-sum; the only viable group-sums are 18 and 21.  

2. From those two viable sums deduce the only admissible pairs (A, D): either (1, 8) or (2, 1).  Hence A ∈ {1, 2} and D ∈ {1, 8}.  

3. Apply clue (2), B − H = J − G = 3, to generate two pools of digits:  
   • B and J are each 3 greater than H and G, so B, J ∈ {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9},  
   • H, G ∈ {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  

4. Apply clue (3), C − F = E − I = 5, to form two more pools:  
   • C, E ∈ {5, 7, 8, 9},  
   • F, I ∈ {0, 2, 3, 4}.  

5. Work with clue (4), B × I = AJ, while enforcing A ∈ {1, 2} and no repeated digits.  This prunes the pools to  
   • B ∈ {6, 7, 8, 9},  
   • I ∈ {2, 3, 4},  
   • J ∈ {6, 7, 8}.

   • G ∈ {3, 4, 5},  
   • H ∈ {3, 4, 5, 6}.  

7. Because H cannot be 5 (it would duplicate C) B cannot be 8; because G cannot be 5, J cannot be 8.  Re-examining clue (4) with these restrictions leaves exactly one consistent triple: B = 9, I = 3, A = 2, J = 7.

Seven married couples (including Mr. and Mrs. Officer) who are current tenants (on the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th floors) are taking advantage of an open house to have a peek at what life is like at the top. Each of the men (including Frank) has recently scaled one of the ""Seven Summits"" - the highest peaks of each continent (including Puncak Jaya of Oceania). Meeting each other during this peek at the penthouse has piqued their interest in scaling all the peaks. The wives (including Linda) are not climbers, but are looking forward to travelling with their husbands to each continent.
From the information given below, can you determine the first and last name of each mountaineer, the floor on which he lives, the peak that he climbed, as well as the name and hair color of his wife?
1. Nora's husband is three floors below Mr. Simpson and four floors above the man who climbed Vinson Massif. These three men are Adam, Brian, and Charles. Their wives all have the same hair color.
2. Mr. Riley is two floors below Edmund and two floors above the man who climbed Mont Blanc (who is not Mr. Peary). These three men's wives are Heidi, Iris, and Jane. Two of these women have red hair, while the other is blonde.

Steps:  
1.  From Clue 1 the three men Mr Simpson, Nora’s husband and the Vinson‐Massif climber live three and four floors apart in that order.  
    The only possible set of equally spaced floors that exists in the list {3,4,6,7,8,10,11} is 10 → 7 → 3, so Mr Simpson is on 10, Nora’s husband on 7 and the Vinson climber on 3.

2.  Clue 1 also says those three men are Adam, Brian and Charles.  
    (Which one is which is left open for now, but we know they occupy floors 10, 7 and 3.)

3.  Clue 2 puts Edmund two floors above Mr Riley and Mr Riley two floors above the Mont-Blanc climber.  
    The only staircase that fits unused floors is 8 → 6 → 4, so Edmund is on 8, Mr Riley on 6 and Mont Blanc on 4.

4.  The alternative 10 → 8 → 6 fails because floor 10 is already occupied by Mr Simpson (Step 1); therefore 8-6-4 is confirmed.

5.  Clue 3 deals with Mr Simpson, Mr Tailor and Mr Upton:   
       – Kate’s husband is somewhere below David and above the Kilimanjaro climber.  
       – The three last names involved are Simpson, Tailor, Upton.

       David Tailor on 11, Kate’s husband Mr Simpson on 10, and the Kilimanjaro climber Mr Upton on 7.

6.  From Step 5 we now know: David Tailor lives on 11, Mr Simpson’s wife is Kate (floor 10) and Mr Upton (floor 7) will climb Kilimanjaro.

7.  Clue 4: “George lives somewhere below Mr Tailor and three floors above Mona’s husband. The three men concerned climbed Aconcagua, Denali and Vinson.”  
       – Mr Tailor is on 11 (Step 5).  
       – Three floors below 11 is 8, but that is already Edmund’s floor, so George cannot be there.  
       – Three floors below 10 is 7; that matches a free slot beneath Tailor.  
       – Therefore George is on 6 (the only spot strictly below 11 and still three floors above somebody), making Mona’s husband the man on 3.  
    This lines up the three peaks as: Denali (Mr Tailor, 11), Aconcagua (George, 6), Vinson (Mona’s husband, 3).

8.  Because Mr Riley occupies floor 6 (Step 3), George must be George Riley; hence Mona’s husband is the man on 3 (still unnamed).

9.  Assign the peaks from Step 7 explicitly:  
       – Mr Tailor (11) ⇒ Denali,  
       – George Riley (6) ⇒ Aconcagua,  
       – The man on 3 ⇒ Vinson Massif.

10.  Clue 2 adds that Edmund’s, Mr Riley’s and the Mont-Blanc climber’s wives are Heidi, Iris and Jane, with exactly two redheads and a blonde.  
        – Floors: 8 (Edmund), 6 (Riley), 4 (Mont Blanc).  
        – Postpone colours until more information appears.

11.  Clue 5: Mrs Quarry is two floors below the Everest climber’s wife and two floors above Iris; none of the three women is blonde.  
        – Iris is married to Mr Riley on 6, so Iris is on 6.  
        – Two floors above 6 is 8 ⇒ Mrs Quarry lives on 8.  
        – Two floors above 8 is 10 ⇒ the Everest climber’s wife is on 10.  
        – Therefore: Edmund’s last name must be Quarry (because his wife lives on 8) and the man on 10 must have climbed Everest.

12.  The man on 10 is Mr Simpson (Steps 1 & 5), so Mr Simpson climbed Everest and his wife Kate (10) cannot be blonde (by Clue 5).  
        – Because Clue 1 says Kate, Nora and Mona (the three wives paired with Adam, Brian and Charles) all share a hair colour, they must all be brunette.

13.  From Step 10 we still need two redheads and one blonde among Heidi, Iris and Jane.  
        – Iris is already “not blonde” (Clue 5) ⇒ Iris must be red.  
        – To get the required 2 red + 1 blonde, Heidi is red and Jane blonde.

14.  Jane (blonde) is married to the Mont-Blanc climber on 4.  
        – The only unused surname is Officer, so the Mont-Blanc climber is Frank Officer (Frank is the only unused first name).

15.  Heidi (red) is Edmund Quarry’s wife (floor 8).

16.  Clue 6: “Heidi lives somewhere below Brian’s wife and somewhere above the Aconcagua climber’s wife.”  
        – Heidi is on 8.  
        – The Aconcagua climber is George Riley on 6, whose wife is Iris on 6 (red).  
        – Therefore Brian’s wife must live on 10 or 11.  Eight is already Heidi’s floor, six is Iris’s, so Brian’s wife sits on 10.  
        – Mr Simpson is on 10, so Mr Simpson’s first name is Brian and his wife Kate is already on 10 — consistent with Step 5.

17.  Clue 1 now pins down the first-name mapping:  
        – Mr Simpson (10) is Brian (found in Step 16).  
        – Nora’s husband (7) must be Adam (still unused).  
        – The Vinson climber (3) is therefore Charles.  
        – So floor 7 is Adam Upton with wife Nora and floor 3 is Charles Peary with wife Mona.

18.  We already know Kilimanjaro belongs to Mr Upton (Step 5), completing his line, and Puncak Jaya is the only summit still unassigned, so Edmund Quarry (8) climbed Puncak Jaya.

19.  All attributes are now fixed, giving the complete roster:  
        • 11th – David Tailor – Denali – wife Linda (blonde)  
        • 10th – Brian Simpson – Everest – wife Kate (brunette)  
        •  8th – Edmund Quarry – Puncak Jaya – wife Heidi (red)

Clue 1 also says those three men are Adam, Brian and Charles.  \n    (Which one is which is left open for now, but we know they occupy floors 10, 7 and 3.)\n\n3.

68,"The Antisocial Club meets every week at Jim's Bar.  Since they are so antisocial, however, everyone always sits as far as possible from the other members, and no one ever sits right next to another member.  Because of this, the 25-stool bar is almost always less than half full and unfortunately for Jim the members that don't sit at the bar don't order any drinks.  Jim, however, is pretty smart and makes up a new rule:  The first person to sit at the bar has to sit at one of two particular stools.  If this happens, then the maximum number of members will sit at the bar.  Which stools must be chosen?  Assume the stools are numbered 1 to 25 and are arranged in a straight line.","Don't forget - the people sit as far away from each other as possible.  If stool #1 is chosen first, the next person will always sit in stool #25.","The first person must take either stool 9 or 17 (because of symmetry, it doesn't matter which).  Assume they pick seat 9.  The next person will pick seat 25, since it is the furthest from seat 9.  The next two people will take Seats one and 17.  The next three will occupy 5, 13, and 21.  The next six will occupy 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 23.  This seats the maximum of 13 people, and no one is sitting next to another person.

Can you tell who is the truth teller, the liar and the unreliable man by asking just three questions?  Each question is directed to a single person.",,"First ask Alex, ""Does Bob sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie?""
A ""yes"" answer means one of the following must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller;
3) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is lying and Bob is the liar.
A ""no"" answer means one of these must be true:
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar;
2) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable;
3) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the truth teller; or
4) Alex is unreliable and is telling the truth and Bob is the liar.
If the answer is ""yes"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the liar?""; if the answer is ""no"", you ask Alex ""Is Bob the truth teller?""
Depending on the answers to the first two questions, you know one of the following:
A) If the answer to both questions was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is the truth teller; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the liar.
B) If the answer to both questions is ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is the liar; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the truth teller.
C) If the answer to the first question was ""yes"" and the second question was ""no"" then either
1) Alex is the truth teller and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and lied on the first question and Bob is the truth teller.

D) If the answer to the first question was ""no"" and the second question was ""yes"" then either
1) Alex is the liar and Bob is unreliable; or
2) Alex is unreliable and Bob is the liar.
In either case, Chuck is the truth teller.
In cases A & B you've identified one person as either the liar or the truth teller and you've identified another person as either not the liar or not the truth teller.

Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and once more missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on Kebabs.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?",,"Block 1: A, B, F, J, R, and S.
Block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
Block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
Block 4: G, H, K, P, T, and X.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that E and A are not on the same block.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that E and O are not on the same block.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that A and O are not on the same block.
Combining these, we conclude that A, E, and O are on different blocks. Assume that A is on block 1, E is on block 2, and O is on block 3.
From the words BOXY and EXAM, we conclude that X is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and O (block 3), so X is on block 4.
From the words BOXY and OKAY, we conclude that Y is not on the same block as A (block 1), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so Y is on block 2.
From the word EXAM, we conclude that M is not on the same block as A (block 1), E (block 2), and X (block 4), so M is on block 3.
From the word OKAY, we conclude that K is not on the same block as A (block 1), Y (block 2), and O (block 3), so K is on block 4.
From the word BOXY, we conclude that B is not on the same block as Y (block 2), O (block 3), and X (block 4), so B is on block 1.
From the words BUCK and JUMP, we conclude that U is not on the same block as B (block 1), M (block 3), and K (block 4), so U is on block 2.
From the words PAWN and JUMP, we conclude that P is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and M (block 3), so P is on block 4.
From the word JUMP, we conclude that J is not on the same block as U (block 2), M (block 3), and P (block 4), so J is on block 1.
From the words CHAW and BUCK, we conclude that C is not on the same block as A (block 1), U (block 2), and K (block 4), so C is on block 3.
From the words CHAW and PAWN, we conclude that W is not on the same block as A (block 1), C (block 3), and P (block 4), so W is on block 2.
From the word CHAW, we conclude that H is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and C (block 3), so H is on block 4.
From the word PAWN, we conclude that N is not on the same block as A (block 1), W (block 2), and P (block 4), so N is on block 3.
Now, we must still have three letters for block 1, and two letters for each of the blocks 2, 3, and 4. We have the following letters left:
D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z
From the words DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as D, F, G, L, R, S, and T, so I is on the same block as Z. Furthermore, I and Z are on block 2, 3, or 4.
From the word ZEST, we conclude that Z is not on the same block as E (block 2), so Z is on block 3 or 4.
From the word OGRE, we conclude that G and R are not on the same block as E (block 2), and O (block 3), so G and R are on block 1 or 4, but not on the same block.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that I is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 or 4), so I is on block 2 or 3. Since Z is on block 3 or 4, I and Z must be on block 3. Now we have all six letters of block 3: C, I, M, N, O, and Z.
From the word GIRL, we conclude that L is not on the same block as G and R (block 1 and 4), so L is on block 2.
From the words FLIT and GIRL, we conclude that F, G, L, R, and T are not on the same block as L (block 2), and from the word ZEST, we conclude that S is not on the same block as E (block 2). So D must be on block 2.
Now we have all six letters of block 2: D, E, L, U, W, and Y.
From the words GIRL and DIGS, we conclude that G is not on the same block as R and S.
From the words FLIT and ZEST, we conclude that T is not on the same block as F and S.
Combining this, F, R, and S must be on the same block (block 1), and G and T must be on the same block (block 4).",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 22

13. From PAWN determine that N cannot share a block with A, W or P, so N→Block 3.  

14. List the still–unplaced letters (D, F, G, I, L, R, S, T, Z) and, using DIGS, FLIT and GIRL, note that I cannot be with any of D, F, G, L, R, S or T, so I must share its block with Z.  

15. Apply ZEST to show Z cannot be on Block 2, leaving I & Z on Block 3 or Block 4.  

16. Apply OGRE to show G and R cannot be on Blocks 2 or 3, so they are on Blocks 1 or 4 and cannot be together.  

17. Apply GIRL: since I cannot be with G or R, I (and therefore Z) cannot be on whichever block holds G or R; this forces I & Z onto Block 3, completing Block 3 (C, I, M, N, O, Z).  

18. Apply GIRL again to place L (which cannot be with G or R) onto Block 2.  

19. The only unfilled place on Block 2 is now taken by D, completing Block 2 (D, E, L, U, W, Y).  

20. Remaining letters are F, G, R, S, T.  From GIRL and DIGS observe G cannot share with R or S; from FLIT and ZEST observe T cannot share with F or S.  

21. Combine those restrictions to force F, R and S to share one block and G and T to share the other; with Blocks 1 and 4 the only ones still having room, assign F, R, S to Block 1 and G, T to Block 4.

74,"During the final round of a chess tournament, the eventual top 4 finishers in the tournament played their final game against 4 different opponents. The tournament boards were numbered from 1 to 50 to facilitate location and identification of games. Each of the top 4 finishers played a different opening in this last game. Use the clues below to determine the first and last names of the first through fourth place winners of the tournament, the chess opening each used in his last game, and the number of the chess board on which he played his final game.
1. Mr. Hart played the King's Indian Defence.
2. Steve placed ahead of the one who used the Ruy Lopez opening.
3. The top 4 players were Larry, Mr. Korn, the contestant who opened with Queen's Gambit, and a player who played on an even-numbered board.
4. Mr. Rose finished exactly 2 places ahead of the player on board 31.
5. The number of the 3rd place winner's board is at least 10 higher or at least 10 lower than that of Mr. Baird.
6. The number of the board of the contestant who placed immediately after Bert is exactly 15 higher than the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately before Tom.
7. The lowest board number of the top 4 finishers was exactly half the number of the board played by the one who placed immediately after the one who played the Giuoco Piano opening.
8. The highest board number was exactly 8 higher than the board number of the man who finished exactly two places after Bert.","All other information (First name, Surname, Moves, Positions) are given in the puzzle, apart from the board numbers. The key to this puzzle is figuring them out, and then everything falls into place. Try different combinations, there is only one that works.","Firstly, work out the board numbers. We know that Bert finished in the first 2 (Clue 8) and board 31 finished in the last 2 (Clue 4). Using all combinations of these, we can eliminate all but the correct numbers, ie 16, 31, 32 and 40.
After we know the numbers, the rest falls into place.
First: Steve Rose, Queen's Gambit, board 40
Second: Bert Baird, Ruy Lopez, board 16
Third: Tom Korn, Giuoco Piano, board 31
Fourth: Larry Hart, King's Indian, board 32",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6  

Steps:  
1. From clue 8, deduce that Bert must finish either 1st or 2nd (someone “exactly two places after” him is needed to satisfy the clue about the highest board number).  

2. From clue 4, deduce that the player on board 31 must finish either 3rd or 4th (because Mr. Rose is “exactly two places ahead” of that player).  

3. Apply every board-number condition (clues 5, 6, 7 and 8) while keeping steps 1 and 2 in mind; all trial combinations except the set {16, 31, 32, 40} violate at least one of the board constraints, so the four boards in the final ranking must be 16, 31, 32 and 40.  

4. Place those four boards in finishing-order positions so that all board relations are met: 1st = 40, 2nd = 16, 3rd = 31, 4th = 32.  

5. Use the name/placing clues:  
   • Clue 4 fixes Mr. Rose two places ahead of board 31, so Mr. Rose is 1st (board 40).  
   • Bert, already known to be in the top two, therefore must be 2nd (board 16).  
   • Clue 3 requires Larry and Mr. Korn to be among the remaining two slots; Larry takes 4th (board 32) and Tom Korn takes 3rd (board 31).  

6. Assign the openings with the remaining opening clues:  
   • Clue 1 gives Larry Hart the King’s Indian Defence.  
   • Clue 3 gives Steve Rose the Queen’s Gambit.  
   • Clue 2 states Steve finished ahead of the Ruy Lopez user, so Bert Baird (2nd) must have played the Ruy Lopez.  
   • The only opening left, the Giuoco Piano, goes to Tom Korn (3rd).  

Final ordered solution (derived in step 6):  
1st: Steve Rose — Queen’s Gambit — board 40  
2nd: Bert Baird — Ruy Lopez — board 16

77,"With the death of Arthur Minit, the legendary country of MADADIA's only clock maker, no one else had much experience yet with making clocks. The new church of MADADIA had just been completed and a new clock was needed to fit into the bell tower. A clock was made by the locals, using the books of Arthur Minit as a guide.The newly made clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock. But soon it was noticed that the hour-hand and minute-hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong spindles. The result was that the hour-hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute-hand. When a clock maker arrived from another area, a remarkable thing happened: on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time.
The Question: If the clock started in the 6 o'clock position, then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?",,"Suppose that a second pair of hands turns together with the wrong pair of hands, but then in the correct way. When the wrong pair is in the same position as the correct pair, this means that the time is shown in the right way. First look at the hour-hands that are at the twelve. One turns with the correct speed, the other with a speed that is twelve times as small. These two hands are in the same position again when the 'slow' hand has progressed x minutes. The fast hand then has progressed 60+x minutes. For the time x that passed, then holds: (60+x)/12 = x. This means that x = 5 5/11 minutes.
For the minutes-hands that start at six holds the same. The confused clock therefore shows the correct time again at 5 5/11 minutes past 7.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

78,"Five pirates are trying to split up 1000 gold pieces.  The rules are as follows:
Pirate #1 must divide the gold up in such a way that a majority of the pirates (including himself) agree to.  If he does not get a majority vote, he will be killed, and pirate #2 will get to propose a solution to the remaining 3 pirates, and the same rules will follow.  This continues until someone comes up with a plan that earns a majority vote.
What is the most amount of gold pieces that pirate #1 can keep to himself, and what would his proposal be?
The pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely ruthless (the more dead pirates the better), and infinitely intelligent.",Start backwards - what would pirate #4's options be if the first 3 pirates were killed?,"Like the hint says, start backwards:
If there are two pirates left (#4 & #5), #4 has no options.  No matter what he proposes, pirate #5 will disagree, resulting in a 1-1 vote (no majority).  #5 will kill #4 and will keep all of the gold.
Now say there are 3 pirates left.  #4 has to agree with whatever #3 decides, because if he doesn't #3 will be killed (because #5 won't vote for #3's proposal no matter what it is).  #3 will just propose that he keep all of the gold and will get a 2-1 vote in his favor.
Now if there are 4 pirates left:
#3 won't vote for #2's proposal because if #2's fails, #3 will get all of the gold. #4 and #5 know that they will get nothing if the decision goes to #3, so they will vote for #2's proposal if he gives them one gold piece each. Therefore, #2 would keep 998 gold, and #4 and #5 would each get one gold.
So let's wrap this up:
Pirate #1 needs 2 other votes.  He will not get a vote from #2 because #2 will get 998 gold if #1's plan fails.
#1 offers #3 one gold piece to vote for him, which #3 will accept (if it gets to #2's plan, #3 will get nothing).
#1 then offers #4 or #5 (doesn't matter which) two gold pieces, which is more than they would get with #2's plan.
So #1 can end up with 997 gold pieces, with #3 getting one piece and #4 or #5 getting two pieces.

Howard: chemistry, biology, mathematics
John: biology, mathematics, history",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10

Steps:
1. Create notation for the four possible subjects – Biology (B), Chemistry (C), History (H), Mathematics (M) – and let E, H, J be the three-element subject sets for Edward, Howard, and John, respectively.  Translate every one of the 12 quoted remarks into precise logical statements (label them E1–E4, H1–H4, J1–J4).

2. Record the meta-condition “Exactly two of each boy’s four statements are true.”  This gives the bookkeeping rule that, for each i ∈ {E, H, J}, exactly two of {Ei1, Ei2, Ei3, Ei4} must be true and the other two false.

3. Compare the two global assertions about Mathematics:  
   • E2: “I’m the only one taking Mathematics.”  
   • J1: “We’re all taking Mathematics.”  
   Both cannot be true simultaneously, and they cannot both be false if the two-true rule for Edward and John is to be met.  Conclude J1 is false and therefore E2 can still be either true or false.

4. Examine the two global assertions about Biology:  
   • H3: “We’re all taking Biology.”  
   Accepting H3 as true makes Biology the lone universal subject; this simultaneously satisfies Edward’s E1 (“There is just one subject we’re all taking”) if no other subject ends up being common to all three.

5. Adopt Biology as the single common subject (so B ∈ E, H, J but no other subject is universal).  This forces E1 (exactly one universal subject) and H3 (all are taking Biology) to be counted true.

6. Use Howard’s H2 (“John and I are taking the same subjects”).  If H2 is true then J and H share all three subjects; combine this with J3 (“Ed is taking one subject that I’m not”) which, for John to have exactly two true statements, must also hold.  Therefore Ed differs from John—and hence from Howard—in exactly one subject.

7. From J4 (“Both Howard and Ed are taking Chemistry”) decide whether C belongs to each set.  Let J4 be John’s second true statement (since J1 is already false and J3 chosen true).  Then C ∈ E and C ∈ H.  Because H2 is true, C must also be in J’s set if H and J are identical; but that would make Chemistry a second universal subject, contradicting E1.  Therefore H2 cannot be true; it is false.

8. With H2 false, Howard now has one true statement (H3) and needs exactly one more.  H4 (“Two of us are taking both Chemistry and Biology”) can serve.  Satisfy H4 by letting exactly two of the boys have Chemistry together with Biology.

9. Choose Chemistry for Edward and Howard, but not for John.  This honors J4 (true) and H4 (true) while keeping Chemistry from being universal (so E1 stays true).  To give John three subjects, admit Mathematics and History to J.  E2 (“I’m the only one taking Mathematics”) becomes false (since H and J will have Mathematics), and E3 (“No two of us are taking the same three subjects”) can be the second true statement for Edward once the final sets are distinct.

10. Check statement counts and set sizes:  
    • Edward: C B H   → E1 true, E2 false, E3 true, E4 true/false? (E4 “John is wrong …” is consistent as false) → exactly two true.  
    • Howard: C B M   → H1 false, H2 false, H3 true, H4 true → exactly two true.  
    • John: B M H   → J1 false, J2 (“Howard is taking History”) true, J3 true, J4 false → exactly two true.

88,"Mad Ade was looking after his two year old Nephew (He charges two Kebabs an hour if you are in need of a babysitter).
His Nephew had 4 play blocks each with 6 sides. Each side has a letter from the alphabet. No letters are ever repeated. By arranging the blocks in different ways Mad Ade's nephew managed (By complete and utter fluke) to spell all the words listed below:
BODY
MAZE
CURT
MOVE
DRAW
NOTE
FEAR
PICK
HUNT
QUIT
JOKE
SNOB
KNEW
TYPE
LIFE
Now Mad Ade is relatively simple and missed the potential teaser in the situation, his mind firmly fixed on the Kebabs he was earning.
Can you figure out how the letters are arranged on the 4 blocks?",,"Out of the 26 letters in the alphabet, Only G and X are not used.
There are 7 words with letter 'E' - MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, TYPE, LIFE. It means that none of the letters in these 7 words can be on the same block as the letter 'E'. Hence, the other 5 letters must be from B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.
As BODY is one of the possible word, B and D can not be on the same block.Similarly, C and U also can not be on the same block as CURT is one of the possible word. Hence, E, H, Q, S are on the same block.
Also, S and B can not be on the same block (SNOB). Q and U can not be on the same block (QUIT). Hence, first Block contains C, D, E, H, Q, S
the easiest way is to write down 4 rows each with A to Z, except G and X. Take each word one by one, remove not possible letters and circle the possible letters.
The letters on four blocks are:
Block 1 : C, D, E, H, Q, S
Block 2 : A, B, K, L, T, V
Block 3 : F, O, P, U, W, Z
Block 4 : I, J, M, N, R, Y",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7  
Steps:  
1. Compare the alphabet with the letters that actually appear in the fifteen words; this shows that every letter except G and X is used, so only 24 letters have to be placed on the four blocks.  

2. Notice that the letter E occurs in seven different words (MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, LIFE, TYPE).  Because every word must be made with the four different blocks, none of the other letters in those seven words can share a block with E.  Therefore the five letters that will accompany E must come from the subset of letters that never appear in any of those seven words: B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.  

3. Use BODY and CURT to impose extra pairing restrictions on that subset:  
   • BODY forbids B and D from being on the same block.  
   • CURT forbids C and U from being on the same block.  
   These two restrictions force E’s companions to include H, Q and S (the only letters in the subset unaffected by those two rules).

Notice that the letter E occurs in seven different words (MAZE, MOVE, NOTE, FEAR, JOKE, KNEW, LIFE, TYPE).  Because every word must be made with the four different blocks, none of the other letters in those seven words can share a block with E.  Therefore the five letters that will accompany E must come from the subset of letters that never appear in any of those seven words: B, C, D, H, Q, S, U.  \n\n3.

89,"Mary Beem, who was a wife, mother of four and grandmother of nine, was shot to death by an angry relative. Find out the name of the relative it was by piecing together the relationships of each person with the clues below.
The killer's sister was suspicious of her sibling and confirmed her distrust by talking to three people: her grandfather Bob, her cousin Bo, and her uncle (blood relative) Bill. She called the police, and the suspect was apprehended at the victim's funeral service. Only the direct descendants and their spouses were present. (Note: None of Mary's grandchildren were married or had kids, and no two people have the same first name.)
1. Bill was talking with his brother-in-law Barry.
2. Bart, Buck, and Bruce (who were all brothers) were by their grandmother's casket.
3. Mary's daughter May, who was with her husband Ben, had their two children: Missy and Bernie.
4. Mo, Bob's son-in-law, was comforting his wife Robin, and both were keeping an eye on their sons.
5. Bo was by himself in a corner grieving, while his sister Molly was talking with their cousin Megan.
6. Myra was consoling one of her two children, Brad, who had been very close to his grandmother.
7. Bob was with his daughter Maria.
NOTE: Each of the 4 couples has at least 2 kids.
WHO IS THE KILLER?","Draw a family tree.
Each of the 4 children of Mary Beem has a spouse, and each couple has children.  Since all must have at least two kids, only one couple has three kids (a total of 9 grandchildren).","From the killer's sister's conversation, Bob is Mary's husband, Bill is one of Mary's children, and Bo is a grandchild.
From clue 1 and 2, Barry was a spouse, and since Bart, Buck and Bruce were all brothers, they were the set of three kids. Clue 3 is straightforward - Mary's daughter May is married to Ben and has two kids: Missy and Bernie.
From 4, Robin is a daughter and Bob her spouse.  From 5, Bo and Molly are siblings and grandchildren (since they have a cousin present). Megan has to be from the last couple.  Mo and Robin could only have been parents to the three boys (Bart Bruce and Buck), since all other siblings were a boy and girl.
Clue 6 gives the name of the remaining child, Brad, who must be a sibling of Megan. Both have a mother by the name of Myra. It is unknown at this point if Myra is a spouse or a direct relative.
Since clue 7 says that Bob (Mary's husband) was with his daughter Maria, Myra becomes a spouse. Then, by default, Bo and Molly belong to Maria.

She carefully unpacked the 18 prints of her favorite artists she had collected for a long time and decided to place them through the five rooms in her humble abode, displaying at least two prints in each room.  The prints show the works of four artists and Ellen owns no more than six prints of each artist's work.  Now that she's put together her new place, Ellen's living space finally feels like home!  From the information provided, can you figure out the number, if any, of Degas, Monet, Pissaro, and Sisley prints Ellen hung in each room?  This one will require a little math...
Rooms:  Kitchen, Parlor, Bedroom, Dining, Den
Artists:  Degas, Monet, Pissaro, Sisley
1.  Ellen mounted the same quantity of pictures in the kitchen as she did in the parlor.  She placed the same amount of Monet images in the bedroom as she did in the parlor.
2.  Ellen mounted at least one Pissaro picture in the dining room.  She didn't mount any prints by Degas or Sisley in the den.
3.  The sum of Sisley prints Ellen had acquired is the same amount as the sum of Degas prints she owns in addition to the sum of the prints she's placed in the den.
4.  The parlor contains fewer pictures than the only room in which three Sisley images were mounted but more prints than the only room in which two Degas prints were hung.
5.  The total number of Monet pictures Ellen owns is the same as the total number of paintings by Degas she owns plus the total number of prints she mounted in the kitchen.  Ellen didn't place any pictures by Monet or Degas in the kitchen.

Steps:  
1. Translate each clue into variables and high-level constraints:  
   • Let K, P, B, Dn, Di be the total numbers of prints in the Kitchen, Parlor, Bedroom, Den, and Dining room, respectively (each ≥ 2, sum = 18).  
   • Let the four artist totals be DG, MN, PS, SS (each ≤ 6, sum = 18).  
   • Record every “same,” “none,” and “at least” statement from clues 1-6 as equations or zero entries in a 5 × 4 grid.  

2. From clue 1 place the two global equalities: K = P and MN_Bedroom = MN_Parlor.  

3. From clue 5 note the two “none” conditions for the Kitchen (no Monet, no Degas); therefore every Kitchen print must be Pissaro.  

4. Also from clue 5 write the artist-total equation MN = DG + K. Because K = P and K contains no Monet or Degas, this already limits both DG and MN.  

5. From clue 2 place “none in Den” for Degas and Sisley; Den prints can only be Monet and/or Pissaro.  Put “at least one Pissaro in Dining.”  

6. From clue 3 write SS = DG + Dn (where Dn is the total number of prints in the Den).  This forces Sisley’s overall count to exceed Degas’s overall count by exactly the Den total.  

7. From clue 6 put “none” in Kitchen for Sisley and “none” in Bedroom for Degas—shrinking the possible cells in the grid further.  

8. Because each room needs at least two prints and the five minima would already give 10, observe that Den being the only room with two non-restricted artists is naturally forced down to exactly 2; otherwise the other totals would overshoot 18 under the artist limits.  So set Dn = 2.  

9. With Dn = 2 feed that into SS = DG + 2 (step 6).  This and the 6-per-artist cap restrict the only possible small integer pairs: (DG, SS) = (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), or (4, 6).  Clue 4 (coming next) will narrow this to one.  

10. Apply clue 4: “Parlor total is less than the only room with 3 Sisleys but greater than the only room with 2 Degas.”  This forces exactly one room to have 3 Sisleys (so SS ≥ 3) and exactly one room to have 2 Degas (so DG ≥ 2).  Therefore pick the smallest pair that satisfies both: DG = 2 and SS = 4.  

11. Using DG = 2, K = P, and MN = DG + K combine all running totals:  
    • DG = 2 (and we already know which room must hold them).  
    • MN = 2 + K.  
    • SS = 4 with 3 of them concentrated in a single room.  
    • Current room totals (≥ 2 each) must still sum to 18.  Solving the small remaining integer system gives the unique grid that matches every zero, equality, “only room,” and artist cap.

3. Combine steps 1–2 with clue #7: because the two goats have to be among B, C, K, O and B,C are already tied up as identical pairs, the only way to satisfy the clue is to put the goats in K and O.  
4. Use clue #2: E and O differ but one is a horse; with O now a goat, E must be the horse.  
5. Use clue #8: the two lions are in {A, E, F, M}.  E is now a horse, so the lions must be A and F.  
6. Use clue #1: A and D differ but one is a dog; since A is a lion, D must be the dog.  
7. Eliminate possibilities for C and M: they are not beavers (step 2), C is not a cat (clue #9), and M is not a tiger (clue #10).  The only remaining shared species is walrus, so C and M are walruses.

9. Re-examine clue #3: B and L are the same animal but not tiger; the only still-unused species that can fill both squares is cat, so B and L become cats.

Use clue #1: A and D differ but one is a dog; since A is a lion, D must be the dog.  \n7. Eliminate possibilities for C and M: they are not beavers (step 2), C is not a cat (clue #9), and M is not a tiger (clue #10).  The only remaining shared species is walrus, so C and M are walruses.  \n8. Apply clue #11: all four beavers and walruses must be connected.  With walruses now at C and M, the only adjacent water squares left to finish the four-square chain are G and J, so G and J are the beavers.  \n9. Re-examine clue #3: B and L are the same animal but not tiger; the only still-unused species that can fill both squares is cat, so B and L become cats.  \n10. Use clue #6: the two tigers must be in different columns; with none placed yet, choose N as one tiger (column 3).  \n11. Use clue #9: no cat is next to a dog.  B’s neighbors include H, and L’s neighbors include P; therefore H and P cannot be dogs.  With D already a dog and one more dog still needed, I becomes the second dog.  \n12. Apply clue #5: F, K, N, P are all different species.  F is lion, K goat, N tiger, so P cannot be lion/goat/tiger; the only remaining option is horse, so P is a horse.  \n13. A second tiger is still needed and must be in a new column; the only open square that meets all current constraints is H, so H is the second tiger.  \n14. All squares are now filled, giving the final layout:  \n   A = lion, B = cat, C = walrus, D = dog,  \n   E = horse, F = lion, G = beaver, H = tiger,  \n   I = dog, J = beaver, K = goat, L = cat,  \n   M = walrus, N = tiger, O = goat, P = horse.']"
94,"Captain John is the captain of a pirate ship called the ""Wasp"".  He just heard about a lost treasure on a far away island.  He needs to get his two crew mates, and lead them to a ship, but there are guards around and he needs to do this without passing them, or they will throw him in the brig.

95,"Fred Farley spent his summers up north in a cottage on Stoney Lake. There, he often debated with his friends what type of bait was best to use for the fish in the waters.  He decided one year to hold a fishing tournament with the best fishers on the lake, each using a different casting lure.  5 men competed (Fred Farley was NOT one of them) and points were awarded in four categories to determine a winner:
Greatest total Weight of fish caught: 4 points
Greatest Number of fish caught: 3 points
Largest Fish: 2 points
Second-largest fish: 1 point
Winning more than one category: 1 bonus point
Two fishermen did not win any of the categories and first place ended up being a tie between two men who received the same amount of points.
From the statements below, determine the first and last name of each of the contestants, what casting lure was used, and who won each category.
1. Mike (who was one of the category winners), Mr. Black (who is not Terry), and the one that used the plastic worm live near each other.
2. Vick, who did not win the total weight category, did not use the spinner bait; nor did Mr. McNess.
3. The one that used the weighted jig, who was not Terry, did not win any of the categories.
4. Neither Sam nor Mr. Larson live near any of the other three contestants, nor did either use a spinner bait or deep-running crank bait.
5. The fisherman who won the largest-fish category, who was not Mr. Smith, used spinner bait.
6. Mr. Jones, who caught the most fish, did not use a deep-running crank bait.
7. Both Mr. McNess (who did not use a deep running crank bait) and Terry (who did not use a plastic worm) had boat trouble and started after the others.
8. A wounded-minnow was used as one of the casting lures, and Kevin was one of the contestants.","Since only 3 of the contestants won the 4 categories, one of them won two and earned a bonus point.  Since there were two first places, the only possible outcome was that they both received 4 points. Therefore, one contestant won the total weight category (4 points), and another won the largest, second largest category and earned a bonus point (2 + 1 + 1 points).","Kevin Black, spinner bait, largest fish and second largest fish category, bonus for winning two categories, 4 points.
Mike Smith, crank bait, total weight, 4 points
Sam McNess, weighted jig, no category, 0 points
Terry Larson, wounded minnow bait, no category, 0 points
Vick Jones, plastic worm, most fish, 3 points.
From 1: Mike won a category, is not Mr. Black, and did not use the plastic worm.  Mr. Black is not Mike or Terry and did not use the plastic worm.
From 2:  Vick is not Mr. Mc Ness, did not win total weight and did not use the spinner bait. Mr. McNess did not use the spinner bait.
From 3: Terry did not use the weighted jig. The weighted jig won no category.
From 4: Sam is not Larson or Black, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.  Mr. Larson is not Mike, and did not use the spinner, deep running crank or plastic worm bait.
From 5: Mr. Smith did not win the largest fish or use the spinner bait. The largest fish was caught using the spinner bait.
Since Vick and Sam did not use the spinner, they did not win the largest fish category.  Since Mike won a category, he did not use the jig.
From 6: Mr. Jones won the most fish and, therefore, did not use the spinner bait, did not use the deep running crank bait either. Therefore, Black used the spinner and was the largest fish winner. Since Vick did not win the largest fish, by elimination, Kevin is Mr. Black.
From 7: Mr. McNess is not Terry and did not use a deep running crank bait. Therefore, Smith could have only used the crank bait.  Terry did not use a worm. Therefore, Vick used the worm and Sam used the weighted jig (and therefore won no category).
The worm (used by Vick) was thereby only used by either McNess or Jones, and since 2 says Vick is not Mc Ness, Vick is therefore Jones.
Terry, then, is Larson and won no category. Mike then wins the total weight category.
Then by summing up the leftover information, Terry uses the minnow and leaves Mike with the deep-running crank bait. That, in turn, makes Mike's last name Smith. Sam is then McNess.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 15

4. Apply Clue 4: Sam is neither Mr Larson nor Mr Black and used neither a spinner bait nor a deep-running crank bait; Mr Larson is not Mike and used neither spinner nor deep-running crank (nor plastic worm, per the solver).  
5. Apply Clue 5: the Largest-Fish winner used a spinner bait and is not Mr Smith; therefore Mr Smith used no spinner and won no Largest-Fish points.  
6. Combine Steps 3 & 5: because the weighted jig wins nothing, Mike (who must win something) cannot have the weighted jig.  
7. Apply Clue 6: Mr Jones won the Most-Fish category and used neither spinner nor deep-running crank bait.  
8. Reconcile spinner ownership: spinner bait must belong to someone who (a) wins Largest-Fish, (b) is not Mr Smith, Mr Jones, Vick or Sam (none of them can use spinner).  Thus spinner bait—and the Largest-Fish award—go to Mr Black.  
9. Because Kevin is an as-yet-unplaced first name and Vick/Sam cannot be Mr Black, Kevin is deduced to be Mr Black (Kevin Black).  
10. Use Clue 7 with earlier results: Mr McNess is not Terry and cannot use deep-running crank; the only surname left to pair with that lure is Mr Smith, so Mr Smith must use the deep-running crank bait.  
11. Clue 7 also says Terry did not use a plastic worm; with spinner, jig and crank already placed, the remaining lures slot as follows: Vick takes the plastic worm, Sam takes the weighted jig (which matches Step 3 and gives Sam no category win).  
12. Since Vick is not Mr McNess (Step 2) and the worm-user can only be McNess or Jones, Vick must be Mr Jones—confirming him as the Most-Fish winner.  
13. With Black, Smith, and Jones assigned, the only surnames left are Larson and McNess.  Terry cannot be McNess (Clue 7), so Terry is Mr Larson.

3. Krieger's segment began at 7:45.
4. Alice appeared after the person from Oakland and before the person surnamed Morley.
5. The people from Berkeley and Daly City aren't of the same sex.
6. The six guests were: Cathy, the person whose first name is Damien, the person whose last name is Novak, the person from Daly City, the person from Palo Alto and the bungee jumper.
7. The last name of the financial adviser is either Lautremont or Novak.
8. Jaspersen's segment began exactly 45 minutes after the beekeeper's segment.
9. The crepe chef went on sometime before the person from Sausalito and sometime after Brandon.

7:30, Brandon Jaspersen, Corte Madera, Bungee jumper
7:45, Evan Krieger, Daly City, Crepe Chef
8:00 Francine Novak, Sausalito, Financial Adviser
The hypnotherapist's segment began at 7:15 (10). Jaspersen's segment was in the second half (8). The beekeeper was in the first half, and was either 6:45 or 7:00 (8). Since Krieger was at 7:45 (3), then Jaspersen was at 7:30. This leaves the beekeeper at 6:45 (8). The antique car collector has to be at 7:00 (1).
The financial adviser isn't Jaspersen or Kreiger (7), and is therefore on during the 8:00 segment. Likewise, Morley can't be at 8:00 (7), or in the first two segments (4); thus Morley has to be at 7:15. This puts Alice at 7:00 and Oakland at 6:45 (4). This also puts Ivens at 6:45 and Berkeley at 7:15 (1).
The two guests in the 6:45 and 7:15 segments are neither Novak, from Daly City or Palo Alto, or interested in bungee jumping. Therefore, these guests must be Cathy and Damien (6). Therefore, Brandon is at 7:30, the chef at 7:45, and the guest from Sausalito at 8:00 (9). The bungee jumper, who must be at 7:30, cannot be from Daly City or Palo Alto, and so is from Corte Madera (6). Alice must be from either Daly City or Palo Alto, so cannot have a last name of Novak (6).
Therefore, Lautremont is in the 7:00 time slot and Novak is the 8:00 time slot. Damien was at 6:45 (2), leaving Cathy at 7:15.

Steps:  
1. From clue 10, fix the hypnotherapist’s segment at 7:15.  
2. From clue 8, note that Jaspersen’s segment is 45 minutes after the beekeeper’s, so Jaspersen must be in the second half of the show (7:30 – 8:00).  
3. Therefore, the beekeeper must be in the first half and, more narrowly, at 6:45 or 7:00.  
4. From clue 3, place Krieger at 7:45.  
5. Because 7:45 is already taken, Jaspersen cannot be at 7:45; thus the only way to keep the 45-minute gap is: beekeeper = 6:45 and Jaspersen = 7:30.  
6. Clue 1 says the antique-car collector is one of the first three guests; with 6:45 filled and 7:15 taken by the hypnotherapist, put the antique-car collector at 7:00.  
7. By clue 7 the financial adviser’s last name is Novak or Lautremont and the job is not held by Jaspersen or Krieger, so the financial adviser must be the still-open 8:00 guest.  
8. Since the financial adviser is at 8:00, Morley can’t be 8:00 (clue 7) and, by clue 4 (Alice before Morley and after Oakland), Morley also can’t be 6:45 or 7:00; therefore give Morley the 7:15 slot.

14. Alice (7:00) is either Daly City or Palo Alto (clue 6) and cannot be Novak, so give her the surname Lautremont and reserve Novak for 8:00.  
15. Clue 2 requires Damien’s segment to precede Lautremont’s; hence Damien is the 6:45 guest and Cathy the 7:15 guest.  
16. Since Cathy (female) is from Berkeley, clue 5 says the Daly City resident must be male, so Alice cannot be from Daly City; therefore Alice’s town is Palo Alto.

98,"You are part of a group of 500 people who have been captured by an evil tribe. The tribe leader, who appreciates a person with good logic, decides that he will propose a challenge of many headband problems.
The first challenge is that each person will get a random headband of one of two colors, black or white. There are 500 of each (500 black and 500 white). If you look at yours or say a word after you have been given your headband and before you have guessed, the evil people will kill everybody. Also, if you make any movement with your body other than your eyes, you will ALL die.
At the count of 10, each person will shout out what color they think their headband is. If you or anyone else is right, you will survive for the next challenge.  If not, you will be killed immediately. You are given some time to discuss your strategy; then you are given your headbands.
How many survivors can you guarantee, assuming the tribe leader is not lying and that each person will follow your instructions? For example, if you tell everybody to guess, you can guarantee zero survivors because you have a slight chance of getting zero survivors.",You can guarantee a lot less than you think...,"You can guarantee that 1/2 of the people will survive.
What to do?  Partner everybody up and tell one person to guess the same color as the other person's headband, and the other person to guess the color of the headband that they see.
For example if Person #1 guesses the same and Person #2 guesses opposite...
Person #1=Black  Person #2=Black  Person #1 Survives
Person #1= White Person #2=White  Person #1 Survives
Person #1=Black  Person #2=White  Person #2 Survives
Person #1=White Person #2=Black   Person #2 Survives
Note: You cannot tell person #1 to guess the same color as the second person's hat and then the second person to guess that color, because everybody has to guess at the same time.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5  

Steps:
1. Before any headbands are put on, divide the 500 people into 250 pairs (or generally, pair everyone up).  
2. Inside every pair assign fixed roles: Person A will guess “the same color I see on my partner,” while Person B will guess “the opposite color of what I see on my partner.”  
3. When the leader counts to ten, everyone simultaneously follows his or her role-rule and shouts the chosen color (no looking, talking, or movement until that moment).  
4. Check the four possible headband-color combinations in any pair: BB, WW, BW, WB.  In each case exactly one of the two rules (same vs. opposite) yields a correct self-guess, so every pair is guaranteed at least one correct shout.  
5. Because each pair guarantees one survivor, at least half of the entire group (one person per pair) will certainly live through the first challenge.",,5,"['Total Step Count: 5  \n\n', '\n1.

99,"Long ago, back before serious illness existed and the new inventions of today, there lived the Handy People. Their height was measured in hands, and they lived long lives.  From the statements below identify each of the 5 Handy people's height (12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hands) and their ages (100, 110, 120, 130 and 140 years).
TWIST: One statement is FALSE.
1. Har was not the oldest, nor was he the shortest or tallest.
2. Winn was taller than Edvo, who was taller but younger than Frer.
3. Tolo, who was not the second oldest, was older than Har, and shorter than Frer.
4. The one who was 13 hands tall was the oldest.
5. Har was taller and older than Winn and Tolo.
6. The fourth oldest was taller than Tolo, but shorter than Edvo, who was older than Winn.",,"Edvo, 15 hands, 130 years
Frer, 13 hands, 140 years
Har, 14 hands, 110 years
Tolo, 12 hands, 120 years
Winn, 16 hands, 100 years
When going through all the statements, it is impossible that both 3 and 5 be true. (3 says Tolo is older than Har while 5 says Har is older than Tolo.) 2 gives the order of height as Winn, Edvo, and Frer. If 5 is true, then Har must be the tallest, but this contradicts 1, therefore 5 is false.
From 1, 2 and 3 it can be seen that the order of height is Winn, Edvo, Frer, and Tolo - with Har somewhere in between but not the shortest or tallest. Therefore Winn is 16 hands, and Tolo is 12.
Since Har is not the oldest, he is not 13 hands, which makes Frer 13 hands and the oldest.
From 3 and 6, Tolo is not the 2nd or 4th oldest and is not the youngest. Therefore he becomes 120 years. Also from 6, Edvo is not the 4th oldest or youngest. Therefore he is 130 years.
Since the 4th oldest is shorter than Edvo, Har must be it at 110 years. And Winn is the youngest. Since the 4th oldest was shorter than Edvo, Har is 14 hands and Edvo is 15 hands.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5  

Steps:  
1. Note that statements 3 and 5 cannot both be true (3: Tolo older than Har; 5: Har older than Tolo).  
   • Assume 5 is true → together with 2 (Winn > Edvo > Frer in height) Har would have to be tallest, contradicting 1 (Har not tallest).  
   • Therefore statement 5 is the single false statement; statement 3 is true.

2. Combine the true height relations:  
   • From 2: Winn > Edvo > Frer.  
   • From 3: Frer > Tolo.  
   ⇒ Height order: Winn > Edvo > Frer > Tolo, with Har somewhere between Winn and Tolo but not at either extreme (per 1).  
   ⇒ Tallest (16 hands) = Winn, shortest (12 hands) = Tolo.

3. Use the “13-hands is oldest” clause (4) with “Har not oldest” (1):  
   • Har cannot be 13 hands.  
   • The only unassigned person in the Winn–Edvo–Frer–Har chain who can take 13 hands is Frer.  
   ⇒ Frer is 13 hands and, by 4, is the oldest (140 years).

4. Work out ages with 3 and 6:  
   • 3: Tolo older than Har and not 2nd oldest.  
   • 6: 4th oldest taller than Tolo but shorter than Edvo; Edvo older than Winn.  
   • Therefore Tolo cannot be 2nd, 4th, or 5th (youngest) → he must be 3rd oldest → 120 years.  
   • Edvo cannot be 4th or 5th and is older than Winn, so Edvo is 2nd oldest → 130 years.

5. Fill remaining slots:  
   • 4th oldest must be Har → 110 years; Winn is youngest → 100 years.  
   • 6 says 4th oldest (Har) is shorter than Edvo; remaining unassigned heights are 14 and 15, so Edvo gets 15 hands and Har 14 hands.

Final assignments:  
Edvo—15 hands, 130 years

106,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by his students' ability to solve logic puzzles. He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
Manny, Moe, and Jack each opened their envelopes. Mr. Simkin asks Manny if he knows anything about the numbers the other two are holding, and Manny says, ""I know that Moe and Jack are holding different numbers.""
Moe answers, ""IN THAT CASE, I know that all three of our numbers are different.""
Jack thinks for a bit, and then says, ""Now I know all of our numbers.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class and asks if anyone in the class knows the numbers. Gretchen's hand shoots up into the air, and after waiting for a while to see if anyone else will get the answer, Mr. Simkin calls on Gretchen.
What numbers does she say they each are holding?",,"Manny has a 3, Moe has a 2, and Jack has a 9.
From Manny's statement, we can deduce that his number is odd. Since Moe did not know that they were all different until Manny said that, we know that Moe is not holding a 7, 9, or 11. (Otherwise, he would have already known they were all different.) If he were holding a 1, 3, or 5, he would not be able to be sure his number was different than Manny's. If he were holding a 4, 8, or 12, he could not know that Manny and Jack didn't have the same number, since there are odd pairs that would bring the total to 14. Therefore, Moe must be holding a 2, 6, or 10.
There are 12 triples for (Manny, Moe, Jack) that satisfy all three statements. They are:
(1, 2, 11)
(1, 6, 7)
(1, 10, 3)
(3, 2, 9)
(3, 6, 5)
(3, 10, 1)
(5, 2, 7)
(5, 6, 3)
(7, 2, 5)
(7, 6, 1)
(9, 2, 3)
(11, 2, 1)
Since Jack can reason flawlessly, he knows these are the possibilities. In order to make his statement, his number has to be a unique solution. Therefore, he must be holding a 9 or an 11. If he were holding 11, though, he would have known from Manny's statement that Manny had a 1, Moe had a 2, and he had an 11. Since he didn't know them all until after Moe spoke, he must have a 9, leaving Manny a 3 and Moe a 2.

Steps:  
1. Interpret Manny’s remark “Moe and Jack are holding different numbers” and note that, for Manny to be absolutely certain of this, his own number must be odd (otherwise he could not rule out the possibility of Moe = Jack).  

2. Observe that Moe did not already know the three numbers were all different before Manny spoke; this eliminates the possibilities that Moe’s number is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 4, 8, or 12. Hence Moe’s number can only be 2, 6, or 10.  

3. Generate every triple (Manny, Moe, Jack) of positive integers that (a) sums to 14, (b) has Manny odd, (c) has Moe in {2, 6, 10}, and (d) has all numbers different. The twelve resulting triples are:  
   (1,2,11), (1,6,7), (1,10,3), (3,2,9), (3,6,5), (3,10,1),  
   (5,2,7), (5,6,3), (7,2,5), (7,6,1), (9,2,3), (11,2,1).  

4. Note that Jack, knowing his own number and the previous conversation, will consider exactly these twelve triples; for him to now say “I know all our numbers,” his own number must occur in only one of the twelve triples.  

5. Check the twelve triples and see that only Jack = 9 or Jack = 11 occurs uniquely (each appears in exactly one triple).  

6. Realize that if Jack’s number were 11, he would already have been able to determine all three numbers immediately after Manny’s statement alone (because only the triple (1,2,11) would then be possible); since Jack did not speak until after Moe, Jack cannot be holding 11.

Steps:  
1.  Compute the global tally.  With 25 total votes and “one more aye than nay,” there must be 13 ayes and 12 nays in all.  

2.  Work out the only way five different integers from 0-5 inclusive can add to 13.  The set must be {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}.  Hence one proposal is unanimously defeated (0 ayes) and another is unanimously approved (5 ayes).  

3.  Note from Clue 5 that Rosina votes aye on proposal 4, so proposal 4 cannot be the 0-aye proposal; it is therefore either the 4-aye or the 5-aye proposal.  

4.  Clue 7 states that proposal 3 gets exactly one more aye than proposal 2.  Among the still-available tallies this can only be 0→1, 3→4 or 4→5.  (0→1 is impossible because proposal 4 has an aye, so 0 cannot be proposal 4.)  That leaves the alternatives (3, 4) or (4, 5) for (proposal 2, proposal 3).  

5.  Apply Clue 4: Orlando, Penny and Sven all vote the same way on proposal 2.  If proposal 2 had 4 ayes, OPS could supply at most 3 of them and would need another councillor’s aye.  If proposal 2 had 3 ayes, OPS alone could supply every aye.  Either case is still viable, so keep both possibilities for now.  

6.  Use Clue 3: Quincy may not cast two consecutive nays.  Therefore, if he is one of the nays on proposal 2, he must be an aye on proposal 3.  (We shall see that he must indeed be a nay on proposal 2 in order to allow OPS to be the three ayes there.)  This forces proposal 2 to be the 3-aye case and proposal 3 the 4-aye case.  

7.  Fix proposal 2.  Since it needs exactly 3 ayes and OPS vote alike, they must all vote Aye; Quincy and Rosina therefore vote Nay on proposal 2.  

8.  Turn to proposal 3.  Quincy, having just voted Nay, must vote Aye here (Clue 3).  Proposal 3 needs four ayes in total; with Quincy already aye, three more ayes are required.  

9.  Apply Clue 6: Quincy and Sven must vote differently on each of the first three proposals.  On proposal 2 Quincy was Nay and Sven Aye, so on proposal 3 Quincy is Aye and Sven must be Nay.  That leaves Orlando, Penny and Rosina to deliver the other three ayes, giving proposal 3 its required total of four.  

10. Use Clue 6 again for proposal 1.  Quincy and Sven still have to differ, and Quincy cannot put himself in a second consecutive Nay position (he is currently Aye on proposal 3), so let Quincy vote Aye and Sven vote Nay on proposal 1.  That makes proposal 1 the lone 1-aye proposal, with all others voting Nay.  

11.  The tallies still unassigned are 0 and 5.  Because Rosina is already known to be Aye on proposal 4, proposal 4 cannot be the 0-aye case; therefore proposal 4 must be the unanimous 5-aye proposal, leaving proposal 5 as the unanimous 0-aye proposal.  

12.  Fill in the now-forced remaining votes (everyone Aye on proposal 4, everyone Nay on proposal 5) to obtain the complete voting record:  
• Orlando – N A A A N  
• Penny   – N A A A N  
• Quincy  – A N A A N  
• Rosina  – N N A A N  
• Sven    – N A N A N  

All seven original clues are satisfied, so this is the finished solution.",,12,"['Total Step Count: 12  \n\n', '  \n1.  Compute the global tally.  With 25 total votes and “one more aye than nay,” there must be 13 ayes and 12 nays in all.  \n\n2.  Work out the only way five different integers from 0-5 inclusive can add to 13.  The set must be {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}.  Hence one proposal is unanimously defeated (0 ayes) and another is unanimously approved (5 ayes).  \n\n3.  Note from Clue 5 that Rosina votes aye on proposal 4, so proposal 4 cannot be the 0-aye proposal; it is therefore either the 4-aye or the 5-aye proposal.  \n\n4.  Clue 7 states that proposal 3 gets exactly one more aye than proposal 2.  Among the still-available tallies this can only be 0→1, 3→4 or 4→5.  (0→1 is impossible because proposal 4 has an aye, so 0 cannot be proposal 4.)  That leaves the alternatives (3, 4) or (4, 5) for (proposal 2, proposal 3).  \n\n5.  Apply Clue 4: Orlando, Penny and Sven all vote the same way on proposal 2.  If proposal 2 had 4 ayes, OPS could supply at most 3 of them and would need another councillor’s aye.  If proposal 2 had 3 ayes, OPS alone could supply every aye.  Either case is still viable, so keep both possibilities for now.  \n\n6.  Use Clue 3: Quincy may not cast two consecutive nays.  Therefore, if he is one of the nays on proposal 2, he must be an aye on proposal 3.  (We shall see that he must indeed be a nay on proposal 2 in order to allow OPS to be the three ayes there.)  This forces proposal 2 to be the 3-aye case and proposal 3 the 4-aye case.  \n\n7.  Fix proposal 2.  Since it needs exactly 3 ayes and OPS vote alike, they must all vote Aye; Quincy and Rosina therefore vote Nay on proposal 2.  \n\n8.  Turn to proposal 3.  Quincy, having just voted Nay, must vote Aye here (Clue 3).  Proposal 3 needs four ayes in total; with Quincy already aye, three more ayes are required.  \n\n9.  Apply Clue 6: Quincy and Sven must vote differently on each of the first three proposals.  On proposal 2 Quincy was Nay and Sven Aye, so on proposal 3 Quincy is Aye and Sven must be Nay.  That leaves Orlando, Penny and Rosina to deliver the other three ayes, giving proposal 3 its required total of four.  \n\n10. Use Clue 6 again for proposal 1.  Quincy and Sven still have to differ, and Quincy cannot put himself in a second consecutive Nay position (he is currently Aye on proposal 3), so let Quincy vote Aye and Sven vote Nay on proposal 1.

111,"Hi, my name is mister Kvakk. I live in a very big house in the country. Outside my house I have a lot of very big gardens, and it is in one of these gardens my dog (which is also my best friend) lives. But although my dog is just a dog, it has also got the ability to think. And not just that, my dog is a really smart and rational dog too.
Unfortunately, the dog is not happy. It is infected by a virus. It feels ill. The doctor says it's a 50% chance that it will die, and a 50% chance that it will be fresh again.
But in this garden where my dog lives, I have also a lot of plants. Some days ago, I put a new seed in my garden. The seed will grow up to a beautiful, red flower. So delicious will the flower be, that my dog really will want to eat it when it has grown up (yes, my dog eats flowers). But the flower is even more wonderful. If my dog eats this flower, this will kill every virus in it, and the dog will survive.
But this flower is also a very special kind of plant, because it has the ability to think too. And it is completely rational. It knows that my dog will want to eat it one day later. Therefore, the flower has the option to develop a weapon: At any time it may start to develop poison. If my dog is so unlucky to eat a flower full of poison, it will surely die, which, of course, it doesn't want to. So if the flower decides to develop poison, it's best for the dog not to eat it.
But the poison development is not an easy task to do for the flower. It doesn't want to make poison just to make poison. If it could avoid developing poison, it wouldn't do it. But, of course, the flower would like to live too, and it's better for it to develop poison than to be eaten by the dog.
Unfortunately, there is no way for the dog to see or know whether the flower has decided to develop poison or not. Both the dog and the flower know this. The dog knows, however, that the flower is just as rational as itself. The dog knows that the flower has the option to make poison, and the dog knows that the creation of poison is a hard task to do for the flower, and that it will only do it if it can save its life. In the same way, the flower knows that my dog is completely rational. My dog also knows that the flower cares only about itself. Whether the dog dies or not is irrelevant to the flower. No other red flowers will ever grow in this garden.
Let's sum up the assumptions:
1. The flower is rational and wants to make its own life as good as possible.
2. The flower knows that the dog is rational.
3. The flower doesn't want to die.
4. The flower doesn't care about what will happen to the dog.
5. The flower doesn't want to make poison. It's a hard task to do.
6. But the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
7. The dog is rational.
8. The dog knows that the flower doesn't care about whether the dog dies or not.
9. The dog doesn't want to die.
10. The dog knows that the flower is rational (there is no uncertainty at this point, it knows it for sure).
11. The dog knows that the flower will make poison if that could prevent the dog from eating it.
12. The dog cannot see or know whether the flower actually makes poison or not.
13. The dog knows that the flower knows that the dog cannot see or know this.
14. If the dog eats a flower without poison it will survive. If it is poisonous it will die.
15. If the dog doesn't eat the flower, it is a 50 % chance that it will die.
So now, the question is: Will the dog eat the flower? Why or why not?"," 1:
We know from assumption 5 and 6 that the flower will only develop poison if that could prevent it from being eaten. And we know that the dog knows this (assumptions 10 and 11). It therefore knows how the flower thinks, but it's impossible for the dog to actually see if the flower has produced poison or not. And the flower knows this.
Hint 2:
Since the dog cannot see whether the flower has developed poison or not, its action must be independent of what the flower actually has done. Should the flower make poison? Remember that the dog knows for sure that the flower is rational. So, the dog should try to think what it would have done if it had been the case that it were the flower.","The dog will eat the flower, and because the flower does not develop poison, the dog will survive. (As you can see, the flower was my medicine to the dog!)
But why will the dog eat the flower?
1. If the dog does not eat the flower, it's a 50 % chance that it will die
2. Remember further, that the dog cannot see or know whether the flower has actually produced poison or not. So what the dog decides to do is therefore independent of what the flower decides to do. If the dog has decided to eat, the flowers action cannot prevent it, and if the dog has decided not to eat, the flower cannot do any thing about this either. It has only some control over whether the dog will die or not, but it doesn't care about this.
3. The flower knows that the dog cannot know whether it has produced poison or not. Consequently, the flowers choice of action is unimportant for what the dog will do. Poison creation cannot change the action of the dog.
4. We know that the flower will only make poison if it could prevent it from being eaten. But it can't. The only reason the flower could have to make poison was to get revenge over the dog. But we know from assumption 4 that the flower doesn't want revenge.
5. That's why the flower has no reason to make poison. What the dog will do is INDEPENDENT of whether it will create poison or not.
6. The flower has no reason to make poison. Because what the dog decides to do is not dependent of whether it makes poison or not. If the dog should eat it, it will die no matter what it has done. And in that case it is best for it to not make poison, because that will make its life better. In the same way; if the dog will not eat the flower, it will be best for the flower to live a life without poison.
7. It doesn't matter what the dog will do: In any case, the flower will not produce poison
OK, this is half of the solution. We now know that the flower will not make poison. And from assumptions 7, 8, 10 and 11 we now that the dog will know this too. The dog can be fairly sure about that the flower will not make poison. This is because the dog knows that the flower is rational, and it knows how the flowers preferences are (assumptions 8 and 11). We know that the flower will not be poisonous if it is rational, and the dog will know this too. Therefore, the dog can eat the flower (and save its life!).
8. Because the dog knows that the flower is rational, it can guess how the flower might think. Therefore, it will know that the flower will not be poisonous
9. It can eat the flower. The probability of death will certainly be much higher if it doesn't.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8  
Steps:  
1. Compare the dog’s two basic options: if it abstains from eating the flower it faces a 50 % chance of dying; if it eats, its fate depends solely on whether the flower is poisonous.  
2. Note that the dog cannot observe or detect poison, so its eventual choice (eat vs. not eat) cannot be conditioned on the flower’s actual decision about producing poison.  
3. Recognize that the flower also knows the dog lacks this information; hence the flower understands that the dog’s action is independent of (i.e., unaffected by) the flower’s poison decision.  
4. Recall the flower’s motive: it dislikes the costly task of making poison and would undertake it only if doing so could prevent it from being eaten.  
5. Since poisoning cannot influence the dog’s already‐independent action, producing poison provides the flower no survival benefit; the cost therefore outweighs any gain.  
6. Being rational, the flower chooses not to create poison.  
7. The dog, knowing the flower is rational and knowing the flower’s preferences and reasoning, deduces that the flower will not be poisonous.

Who won the competition?
How many points did each player score?",,"1) Hayden Seek finished with 18 points. - This was a given so my answer needs no explanation.
3) Dan Druff beat Hayden Seek by 5 points. - Therefore, the score was 10 Dan Druff and 5 Hayden Seek; because there is only 15 balls which equals 15 points per game
There was one point difference in match between Annie Buddyhome and Al Gore-Rhythm. - The final score had to be 7 and 8 and since Al Gore-Rhythm finished with an odd score, If you trialed both numbers you will notice Al Gore-Rhythm equaled out to have the 8 points therefore, Annie Buddyhome had the 7 points.
Al Gore-Rhythm scored twice as many points as Dan Druff in their game. - Al Gore-Rhythm equaled 10 points and Dan Druff equaled 5 points so the score would be double winner and half for the loser.
Hayden Seek scored one point less against Al Gore-Rhythm than he did against Dan Druff. Since the score was 10/5 with Dan Druff winning, that means that Hayden Seek scored 4 points in this game because of one point less.
Dan Druff scored 7 points against Annie Buddyhome- Once again 15 points and the game is over, Dan Druff scores 7 and Annie Buddyhome scores 8.
By process of elimination; since Hayden Seek scores 18 points total and you can figure out the 5 points against Dan Druff and the 4 points against Al Gore-Rhythm 9 points was the only number that would fit into the equation.
Thus the scores are Al Gore-Rhythm 8 and Annie Buddyhome 7
Annie Buddyhome 8 and Dan Druff 7
Dan Druff 10 and Hayden Seek 5

The letters M, A, N, and X must appear on four different blocks (so that you can spell ""MANX"").  Call them blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  Block 2 (with the A) must have a letter from CRUX.  It can't be C (because then you wouldn't be able to spell JACK) or U (so you can spell QUAD), so it is R.  Block 2 must also have a letter from KNOW.  It can't be K (JACK) or W (WRIT), so it's O.  The letter H can't be on block 1 (SHIM) or block 2 or 3 (JOHN), so H is on block 4.  J is on block 1 (JOHN).  C can't be on block 1 or 2 (JACK) or block 4 (CRUX), so C is on block 3.  U is on block 1 (CRUX), and K is on block 4 (JACK).  W, then, is on block 1 (KNOW).  I isn't on block 1 or 2 (WRIT), or block 4 (SHIM), so I is on block 3.  T is on block 4 (WRIT) and S is on block 2 (SHIM).  Block 4, which we already know has H, K, T, and X, can have only two more letters:  it must have either D or Q (QUAD), and either G or P (PUGS).

Steps:  
1. Observe that exactly 24 different letters (all except V and Z) are used in the word list, so every letter must appear on exactly one of the 24 block faces.  
2. Because the word MANX uses four different letters, place M, A, N, and X on four different blocks; call those blocks 1, 2, 3, 4 (respectively).  
3. The A-block (block 2) must supply a letter for CRUX; it cannot be C (would block JACK) or U (needed for QUAD), so put R on block 2.  
4. Block 2 must also supply a letter for KNOW; it cannot be K (needed for JACK) or W (needed for WRIT), so put O on block 2.  
5. Letter H cannot go on block 1 (needed for SHIM) nor blocks 2 or 3 (both needed for JOHN); therefore place H on block 4.  
6. To spell JOHN, place J on block 1.  
7. Letter C cannot go on blocks 1 or 2 (JACK) nor block 4 (CRUX), so place C on block 3.  
8. For CRUX and JACK respectively, put U on block 1 and K on block 4.  
9. With K already on block 4, KNOW now requires W, so put W on block 1.  
10. For WRIT, I cannot be on blocks 1 or 2, and SHIM keeps it off block 4; therefore place I on block 3.  
11. WRIT forces T onto block 4, and SHIM forces S onto block 2.  
12. Block 4 now holds H, K, T, X and still needs letters for QUAD and PUGS; it also must cover YELP and BODY. The only consistent pair is D (BODY & QUAD) and P (YELP & PUGS). Add D and P to block 4.  
13. The remaining QUAD and PUGS letters, Q and G, must therefore go on block 3.

121,"Mr. Simkin, the new math teacher at school, was impressed by their ability to solve logic puzzles.  He pulled aside three more students, and handed them each a sealed envelope with a number written inside. He told them that they each have a positive integer, and the sum of their numbers was 14.
They each opened their envelope and inspected their numbers.  Snap said, ""I know that Crackle and Pop each have a different number.""
Crackle replies, ""I already knew that all three of our numbers were different.""
Pop says, ""Now I know what all three of our numbers are.""
Mr. Simkin turns to the class to ask if anyone else knows the numbers.  Only Gretchen raises her hand, and she correctly identifies what each person is holding.  How did she know?",,"Snap's statement implies that his number is odd.  Crackle's statement implies that not only is his number odd, but it is also greater than or equal to 7.

(1, 7, 6)
(1, 9, 4)
(1, 11, 2)
(3, 7, 4)
(3, 9, 2)
(5, 7, 2)
Since Pop can reason perfectly, he knows these are the possible combinations.  In order for him to know the other two, he must be holding a 6, since he knew the solution had to be unique.  Therefore, Snap has a 1, Crackle has a 7, and Pop has a 6.

123,"In a wood-cutting factory, four large sawing machines stand in a windowless room. Each machine has an on/off switch attached, there being no doubt as to which switch controls which machine. Outside the door to the room are four back-up on/off switches, one for each machine inside. The power for each machine must first pass through the back-up switch, and then the machine switch before reaching the saw. The problem is, the new manager cannot decide how these back-up switches match with the machines inside the room. One day, the manager's brother visits. The manager takes him inside the sawing room where all four machines are at work and explains the problem. The brother announces that he intends to leave the room and that when he returns he will be able to match correctly the four switches outside the room to the four machines inside. The brother works alone, cannot see the machines from outside the room and solves the problem purely by operating switches. How is it possible?",,"Turn two machine switches off, go outside the room and, by listening, test all six combinations of two back-up switches to find which two match the two ""machine-on"" switches inside the room. Only one of the six combinations of two back-ups gives complete silence when switched off and these ""machine-on"" back-ups match the two ""on"" in the room. Now, before returning to the room, leave one ""on"" off and one ""off"" on leaving the other ""on"" on and ""off"" off, that is, only two switches are activated.

124,"A plain white cube has gone through 4 steps to become what it is now. The steps (not necessarily in order) are:
a) The whole cube being painted red
b) A white circle being painted on every face except for the top and back
c) The front and back faces being painted black
d) The top, back, and bottom being painted blue
All of the following facts about painting the cube are true:
1. After the last of the four steps, the top face was all purple, the left and right faces were red with a pink circle in each of their centers, the front black with a gray circle, the bottom purple with a light blue circle, and the back completely dark blue.
2. Color mixing goes as follows:
-Red+Blue=Purple
-Black+White=Gray
-Red+White=Pink
-Blue+White=Light Blue
-Red+Black=Maroon
-Blue+Black=Dark Blue
3. Once black is added to a face, it will mix with the colors on the face if possible, but it cannot be changed at all afterwards. This is not true with white.
4. Any area where two colors have been mixed cannot change color.
5. Exactly one of the following is true:
-Black was added first.
-Red was added before blue.
-Blue was added after white.
-White was added last.
In what order were the colors added?","If the back face is dark blue, then blue was added before black.","White, blue, black, red.
Because there are both gray and dark blue regions, black was added after both white and blue. This means black was not first, and neither blue nor white was last.
Black has to have been added before red, because if it wasn't, the front face would be maroon with a pink center. So black was not last, and red was not first.
Since neither blue, black, nor white was last, red had to be added last. Combining this with other facts, white and blue could not be added third. So black was third.
Going back to the statements of which one is true, we can now figure out the lies. Red was added last, so statement 4 is false. Black was added third, so statement 1 is false. Red was not added before any other colors, so statement 2 is false. This makes statement 3 true. White was added before blue, so white is first, and blue is second.

2. Examine the front face: if red had been applied before black the red and black would have mixed to maroon, but the front is pure black (with a gray circle), so black had to be applied before red; consequently, black is not last and red is not first.  

3. Since white, blue, and black have all been ruled out for the last position, red must be the last color applied.

Zoltan Pepper refuses to take part with Brighton Early.
How many acceptable groups can the producer put together?",,"There are 60 possible groupings of two directors and two musicians. However, some of them are not acceptable, because they do not include both an actor and a singer. This brings the possible combinations down to 36. When you eliminate the combinations that represent people who refuse to work together, you end up with 9.The acceptable groups are:
1) Holly Wood, Jed I. Knight, Howard Eyeno, and Brighton Early;

Some interesting points arise here. For instance, Brighton Early appears in eight of the nine groups, while Zoltan Pepper doesn't appear at all. He's completely blocked out by his own and others' conditions on working with certain people, and Brighton Early benefits greatly by being the only musician/singer, especially when he doesn't refuse to work with anyone else.

So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
A traveler came across the bridge. The troll said, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He then wrote thirteen pairs of letters on a rock:

Suppose the second common letter in QUEST is E. Then C and F must be in the password and K cannot. But now FACE has at least three common letters.
Suppose each word has four common letters. Then Q, U, and E must be in the password, and C, F, and K cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So each word has three common letters. The second and third common letters in QUEST cannot be Q and E. Suppose they are Q and U. Then K must be in the password, and C and F cannot. But now FACE has at most two common letters.
So the second and third common letters in QUEST must be U and E. Then C must be in the password, and F and K cannot. The third common letter in FACE must be A, so V cannot. The third common letter in QUICK must be I, so O cannot.

Cowan is neither the hooker who left the Downers nor the wing who signed with the Scarlets (clue 2), so he is a fifth player.
Cowan is not the fullback (clue 2) or the fly half (clue 11).
The center cannot have signed with the Typhoons (clue 3), so the center must have signed with the Downers while Jeeper signed with the Typhoons (clue 4). This means that Cowan cannot be the center (clue 2), and must therefore be the prop.

Since Jeeper signed with the Typhoons, he is one of the three people listed in clue 2: he obviously isn't Cowan, so he is either the fullback or the player who left the Downers, ie the hooker (clue 7). We've established that Jeeper cannot be the fullback, so he is the hooker.
Grippley didn't sign with the Scarlets (clue 10), so he is the center. This leaves Tuitupou as the wing.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets
2) Rokocoko/McGuyver, fullback/fly half, left the Mountaineers
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets
5) Cowan, the prop
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers
The player that left the Mountaineers couldn't have also signed with the Mountaineers, so Cowan signed with the Mountaineers, and the player that left the Mountaineers signed with the Troopers.
The fullback didn't sign with the Jets (clue 2), so the fullback signed with the Troopers and the fly half signed with the Jets.
Rokocoko isn't the fullback (clue 8), so McGuyver is the fullback and Rokocoko is the fly half.
At this point we have the following information:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, signed with the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, signed with the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, signed with the Downers.
Tuitupou left the Downers, the Scarlets or the Jets (clue 3). We've established that Jeeper left the Downers, and since Tuitupou signed with the Scarlets, he must have left the Jets.
The Scarlets, therefore, lost the center (clue 3).
By process of elimination, Cowan left the Typhoons.
So these are the 6 players:
1) Rokocoko, the fly half, left the Troopers for the Jets.
2) McGuyver, the fullback, left the Mountaineers for the Troopers.
3) Jeeper, the hooker, left the Downers for the Typhoons.
4) Tuitupou, the wing, left the Jets for the Scarlets.
5) Cowan, the prop, left the Typhoons for the Mountaineers.
6) Grippley, the center, left the Scarlets for the Downers.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

133,"During the California Gold Rush, an assessor in San Francisco used a balance to measure out quantities of gold dust. He had a set of weights to place on the balance. The assessor needed to be able to measure out gold dust in exact ounces, no fractions, for every number of ounces starting at 1.
If the assessor has four weights, what is the largest number of ounces of gold dust he can measure?
Note: The answer is not 15 ounces",Weights can be placed on the balance plate with or without the gold dust.,"The maximum weight is 40 ounces.

In any weighing, each weight can be placed in one of three ways: on the plate with the gold, on the plate without the gold, on the desk next to the balance. So given n weights, there are 3^n possible combinations.
Throw out the case where all weights are on the table. That leaves 3^n – 1 cases.
Half of those cases would weigh negative gold, so eliminate half of these.

Can you determine the which rooms she cleaned each day and the number of messages she received?
Given:
Cleaning Days -- 	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Number of Messages -- 	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Rooms Cleaned -- 	Bedroom, Living Room, Bathroom, Den, Kitchen
Clues:
#1) Emily received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, but fewer than on Tuesday.
#2) Emily cleaned the bathroom on the day after receiving just one message and one day before she cleaned the den.
#3) She received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den.

Monday -- Bedroom -- 3
Tuesday -- Living Room -- 5
Wednesday -- Kitchen -- 1
Thursday -- Bathroom -- 4
Friday -- Den -- 2
**Clue #1:  If she received more messages on Thursday than on the day she cleaned her bedroom, she could not have received 1 message on Thursday as the day she cleaned her room would have to be 0, which is not an option.  She could not have received 5 messages on the day she cleaned her bedroom because Thursday would then have to be at least 6 messages which is not an option.  Assume also that she did NOT clean her bedroom on Thursday or Tuesday, as they are mentioned in the same clue.  Since she had fewer messages on Thursday than Tuesday, she could not have received 1 message on Tuesday for the same reasons mentioned above.  Also by the same token, she could not have received 5 on Thursday because Tuesday would have to be 6.
**Clue #2:   1 message -- bathroom -- den....the order of the happenings in clue 2.  therefore, she could not have cleaned the bathroom on Monday, nor the den.  Also assume she did not receive 1 message on the bathroom or den cleanings.  She could not have cleaned the bathroom on Friday.  As that would leave no day for the den, which is the day after.  She could not have received 1 message on Thursday or Friday because there would not be enough days to clean the bathroom and den.
**Clue #3:  If she received more messages when she cleaned her bedroom than when she cleaned the den, she could not have received 5 messages when she cleaned the den, nor 1 message when she cleaned her bedroom.
**Clue #4:  She cleaned the Kitchen on Wednesday..self explanatory.
*********Now look back using all the clues instead of 1 at a time.  In Clue 1 and Clue 3.  More messages when she cleaned  her bedroom than the den (#3).  In Clue 1, it says she got more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her room.  So she could NOT have cleaned her den on Thursday.  That leaves Tuesday and Friday for the den.  But remember the order given in Clue 2.  The den could not have been cleaned on Tuesday.  Den was on Friday, which leaves only one day for the bedroom, which is Monday.  Now add in the order in Clue 2, and you know that Thursday she cleaned the bathroom, and Wednesday, when she cleaned the kitchen, she received 1 message.  When you know the bathroom was cleaned on Thursday, that leaves one room and one day.  The living room was cleaned on Tuesday.  That leaves the messages for each day.  We know that the bedroom was cleaned on Monday.  You should have marked off 1 and 5 messages for the bedroom.  So that means that 1 and 5 should be marked off the day the bedroom was cleaned as well.  They have to match.  Another that doesn't match, is that Friday the den was cleaned.  We know that 1 and 5 messages were not received while the den was being cleaned, so 1 and 5 could not have been received on Friday.  After marking that 5 off, there is only one day with a five left -- Tuesday.    You know that she received more messages on Thursday than when she cleaned her bedroom (Monday).  The highest that she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that 4 could not have been received on Monday.  By the same token, we know that she received more messages when cleaning the bathroom (Thursday) than when cleaning the den (Friday).  The highest she could have received on Thursday is 4.  So we know that for Friday to be less, she could not receive 4 messages on Friday.  This means she received 4 messages on Thursday when she cleaned the bathroom.  Looking back at clue 2 gives you the answer for the last section.  She received more messages when cleaning her bedroom than when cleaning the den.  So she received 3 in the bedroom, and 2 in the den.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

139,"In order to best use his study time, Caleb has enlisted the help of four other students in his philosophy class by forming a study group.  Each of the five students is assigned to read one of the first 5 chapters of their text Great Minds Don't Necessarily Think Alike, and prepare a summary of the chapter to present to the group.  Can you determine the title of each of the five chapters, as well as the student responsible for reading it?
Given:
Chapters -- 		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Chapter Titles --		Descartes Before DesHorse, Freudian Slippers, I Kant Understand It, Jung At Heart, Sense of Hume-or
Student Names -- 	Alex, Caleb, Joan, Kiera, Toby
Clues:
#1) Alex's chapter immediately follows ""Sense of Hume-or"" and immediately precedes ""Descartes Before DesHorse.""
#2) ""Jung At Heart"" is the name of a chapter that comes somewhere before the chapter assigned to Toby.
#3) Kiera's chapter is three chapters after ""Freudian Slippers.""
#4) Two consecutive chapters, in one order or the another, are ""I Kant Understand It"" and Joan's chapter (which isn't chapter four)","s:
Make a list of one set of givens and list another set of givens that would correspond to them... i.e. (Chapter Numbers) -- (Titles)
Chap 1 -- Des, Freud, I Kant, Jung, Sense
Chap 2 -- Des, Freud, I Kant, Jung, Sense, etc.
Cross off what you know is NOT the correct answer from the clues, and when you find a chapter number that fits a title, circle it, or write the information on the piece of paper in a different section to keep track.  Do the same with the other correlations that can be surmised by looking at the clues:
(Chapter Names) -- (Students Names)
(Student Names) -- (Chapter Numbers)
Keep in mind that for example, if you find a chapter number for a title, the other chapter numbers can NOT have that title, so that gives you another answer to mark off to narrow the correct answer down.","Answers:
Chapter 1 -- ""Jung At Heart"" -- Caleb
Chapter 2 -- ""Freudian Slippers"" -- Toby
Chapter 3 -- ""Sense of Hume-or"" -- Joan
Chapter 4 -- ""I Kant Understand It"" -- Alex
Chapter 5 -- ""Descartes Before DesHorse"" -- Kiera
**Clue #1:  This gives us an order.  We know that three of the chapters are, in this order, (Sense, Alex's, Descartes).  Therefore, Alex's chapter can not be the first chapter, or the last.  ""Sense"" can not be the last chapter, and ""Descartes"" can not be the first.  We can also assume that ""Sense"" nor ""Descartes"" is Alex's chapter.
**Clue #2:  This lets us know that Toby's chapter can not be the first chapter, and that ""Jung"" can not be the last chapter.  We assume ""Jung"" is not Toby's chapter.
**Clue #3:  If Kiera's chapter is three AFTER ""Freud"", then ""Freud"" can NOT be the 3rd, 4th or 5th chapter.  This also means that Kiera's chapter can not be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd chapters.
**Clue #4:  Joan's chapter is not 4th.  If ""Kant"" is 5th, Joan's would be 4th.  So we know that ""Kant"" is not the 5th chapter.  That leaves ""Descartes"" as the 5th chapter.  Assume Joan's chapter is not ""Kant.""
*********Recall the order given in Clue 1.  This means Alex's chapter is 4th, and ""Sense"" is 3rd.  This also leaves Kiera's as the 5th chapter, which is ""Descartes"".  For hers to be 3 after ""Freud"", ""Freud"" has the be the 2nd chapter.  We know that ""Jung"" comes before Toby's chapter.  This leaves chapters 1 and 4.  If ""Jung"" is chapter 4, Toby's would be 5, but we know that 5 is Kiera's, so ""Jung"" has to be chapter 1.  This makes ""Kant"" chapter 4, and Alex's chapter.  This means that Joans has to be the 3rd or the 5th because of the order between Joan's chapter and ""Kant"" that we were already given, and we already know that Kiera has the 5th chapter.  So we know that Joan has chapter 3, ""Sense.""   After marking off the chapter numbers by the names, you see that Toby's is chapter 2, ""Freud"" and that leaves Caleb with chapter 1, ""Jung.""",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

147,"There are 12 gold coins. One of the coins is fake. It is known that a fake coin weighs either slightly less or slightly more than a real coin. Using a balance scale, how can you find the fake coin, and determine if it weighs less or more than a real coin, in only three weighings?",,"Divide the coins into three groups of 4 coins each. First, weigh two of the groups. If they balance, then the fake coin is in the third group, so take three of the coins, and weigh them against three of the coins that we know for sure are real (from the first 8 coins). If they balance, then the remaining coin is the fake one, but we still don't know if it is lighter or heavier, so weigh it against a real coin to determine that. But if it didn't balance, then we know that the fake coin is one of the three, and we also know if it is lighter or heavier, because we know which side had the real coins. So weigh two of the coins against each other, if they balance then the third coin is fake, if they don't balance we know which coin is fake, because we already know if it is lighter or heavier.
Now let's go back to the first weighing; if the two groups didn't balance, we know that the fake coin is in one of the groups, but we don't know which group. Let's mark the group that was heavier as group A, and the group that was lighter group B. For the second weighing, weigh two coins of group A and one coin of group B, against the other two coins of group A and one coin of group B. If they balance, the fake coin must be one of the remaining two, and a weigh between them will tell us which one (they are both from group B so we know that it's lighter). If the second weigh didn't balance, look at the side that is heavier: Either the fake coin is one of the two group A coins, or it can the group B coin on the other side of the scale. Take the two group A coins, and weigh them against each other. If they balance, then it is the group B coin that is fake, and if they don't balance, then the heavier one is the fake coin.

Room C: large, borders rooms B and D
Room D: small, borders rooms B, C, and E
Room E: large, borders rooms A, B, and D
Here are some facts:
1. The rooms of the lead actor in the play and his or her sibling border the same number of rooms.
2. The lead's room and his or her parent's room are the same size.
3. HEF Jr's room and his daughter's room do not border each other.
4. Each room borders at least one man's room and at least one woman's room.
Who is the lead actor?",,"HEF Jr's sister is the lead actor.
From fact 4, we know that rooms A and C each border one man's room and one woman's room. So one of rooms B and E is occupied by a man and the other by a woman, and one of rooms B and D is occupied by a man and the other by a woman. If room B is occupied by a man, rooms D and E are occupied both by women. Similarly, if room B is occupied by a woman, rooms D and E are both occupied by men. So the occupants of rooms D and E are of the same gender.
Since there were two pairs of siblings, each different-gendered, fact 1 tells us that either one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman, or one of rooms D and E was occupied by a man and the other by a woman. From previous reasoning, we can determine that one of rooms A and C was occupied by a man and the other by a woman.
Since there were only two men, rooms D and E were both occupied by women. And since rooms A, C, D, and E were occupied by three women and one man, room B must be occupied by a man.
Fact 3 tells us that the occupant of room B cannot be HEF Jr, so it must be his son. Therefore, the siblings in rooms A and C must be HEF Jr. and his sister, and one of them must be the lead actor. From fact 3, we have these two scenarios:
1.
Room A: HEF Jr.

Room C: Sister

152,"There is an island filled with grass and trees and plants. The only inhabitants are 100 lions and 1 sheep.
The lions are special:
1) They are infinitely logical, smart, and completely aware of their surroundings.
2) They can survive by just eating grass (and there is an infinite amount of grass on the island).
3) They prefer of course to eat sheep.
4) Their only food options are grass or sheep.
Now, here's the kicker:
5) If a lion eats a sheep he TURNS into a sheep (and could then be eaten by other lions).
6) A lion would rather eat grass all his life than be eaten by another lion (after he turned into a sheep).
Assumptions:
1) Assume that one lion is closest to the sheep and will get to it before all others. Assume that there is never an issue with who gets to the sheep first. The issue is whether the first lion will get eaten by other lions afterwards or not.
2) The sheep cannot get away from the lion if the lion decides to eat it.
3) Do not assume anything that hasn't been stated above.
So now the question:
Will that one sheep get eaten or not and why?","There are two hints. The first one will really be just that - a small hint. The second one is a BIG one, and could very well give it away, so don't read it if you don't want to:
Hint 1) Use math induction.
Hint 2) Consider the scenario where there is only one lion and one sheep. What would happen? Now take the next step.","The sheep would remain untouched.
In fact, the sheep would remain untouched if there is an even number of lions on the island, and would be eaten immediately if there is an odd number of lions on the island.
Here's the reasoning:
Consider a scenario with just one lion and one sheep: The lion will eat the sheep. Why? Because after he eats it and turns into a sheep himself, there aren't any lions on the island to eat him, so he is happy.
Now look at a scenario with 2 lions and 1 sheep. Here the sheep would remain unharmed. Why? Because if any one of them eats it, and turns into a sheep himself, he knows that he awaits certain death because he will then be a sheep and the other lion will be the only lion on the island and nothing will stop him from eating the sheep.
So now we know for a fact 1 lion and 1 sheep - sheep gets eaten. 2 lions and 1 sheep - sheep doesn't get eaten.
We can now make a conclusion about 3 lions and 1 sheep: the sheep will definitely be eaten, because the lion that eats it will know that by eating he leaves behind 2 lions and 1 sheep (himself). And as we already know 2 lions and 1 sheep is a situation where the sheep survives.
You can use the same logic to go on to 4 lions and 1 sheep, and then all the way to 100 or 1000, but it will always be true that with an odd number of lions the sheep gets eaten and with an even number the sheep doesn't.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

153,"In the village of Einstown, every villager thought they were the cleverest. They used to argue about it all the time, so eventually the leader devised a clever plan. He pretended to hold a vote for who was the cleverest person, where people had to nominate other villagers to go up to the vote. Everyone in the village would know of everyone nominated except themselves, and they all knew that at least one person got nominated.
Once the nominations were over the leader announced his plan. He said that the first person to come forward and say that they were nominated with proof would be the cleverest person in the village. He told them to go to the village hall at exactly 7:00 pm once they had worked it out. None of the people told each other if they got nominated, as they all wanted to win.
After the first night nobody had come forward. Nobody came forward on the second night either. Nor the third, fourth fifth etc. Eventually on the 30th night a certain number of people came forward claiming to have been nominated. They were all right.
How many people came forward on the 30th night and why? (Assume that they all were clever enough to work the method out).",,"Call the number of people nominated N.
Any person nominated would know of N-1 people nominated, as they would not know that they themselves were nominated. If there was 1 person nominated, the nominee would know of nobody who was nominated, and therefore would know that they were nominated. Because nobody came forward on the first night there was more than one person nominated.
Using the same logic, anyone on the second night who knew of one person nominated would then be able to work out that they were nominated as there was at least two people. Because nobody came forward on the second night there was at least three.
This carries on all the way up. Nobody came forward on the 29th night, meaning there was at least thirty. People now came forward the next night, so everyone who came forward knew of 29 nominees, meaning 30 people came forward on the 30th night.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

154,"One day three kids decide to wreak havoc in town-again (this is the third time this month). This time they run into an old man's grocery store and steal quite a few items. They hit the wrong spot this time, because this was Old Man Justice's place (he's notorious for meting out his own brand of 'justice'). Old Man Justice chases the kids through town, and during the chase, they drop the goods, turn around, and start chasing him. Unfortunately, the old man falls into a ditch and is badly hurt. A month later after he recovers he is able to identify the culprits, and Old Man Justice calls in his 'support team,' (2 of which were also victims of the thieves), and has the perpetrators rounded up for justice. At a dinner later that evening, dubbed the 'Repast of Right' the old man begins with these words:
'To do what we've done took moxie and nerve,
But alas! As we eat, our justice is served.
As we've judged these few, let's render to each their due,
Not an 'eye for an eye,' but rather 'one for two.'
(What we see as JUST, is JUST what we do.)
Neither trial, nor jury, should these ones receive,
No more to trouble us, for no more shall they breathe!
So drink wine of success, and not of defeat,
Justice is waiting, so friends let us eat.'
Question:
Provided that Old Man Justice and those in his group are not cannibals, how are these three guilty kids punished by the people at the dinner?",,"The Old man and his group certainly did EAT THE KIDS, (as implied by the words of Old Man Justice), but they were of course young goats, and not young delinquent children.
Notice that justice is going to be 'served' along with this meal. Also, this extreme justice is also going to result in the kids not-breathing, (meaning they will die), and thus won't be any more trouble. It is not an 'eye for eye' but more like 'one for two' because Old Man Justice was only injured, not killed, therefore the 'justice' is not proportionate to the crime. It also took guts and nerve for these seniors to hunt down someone's livestock and kill it, without the benefit of due process, or discussion w/ the owner in the least.

Which of the following statements can then be concluded?
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement can be concluded. One or more statements can be concluded.",,"All the three given statements can be concluded.
The given statements are
1) Anu always tells the truth.
2) Coy always lies.
3) Bob is the owner of the Chemistry book.
The answers given by Anu, Bob and Coy to my query about the owners of the Physics, Chemistry and Maths books are as follows :-
Anu : Physics book belongs to me. Maths book does not belong to Bob. Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob : Physics book does not belong to me. Chemistry book belongs to Coy. Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy : Physics book does not belong to Anu. Maths book does not belong to me. Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Case 1 : Let us assume that Anu always tells the truth.
Then according to Anu's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Maths book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Anu's reply with that of Bob's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
Coy lies three times when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 1, Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie and Coy always lies. Also in this case the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.
Case 2 : Let us assume that Bob always tells the truth.
Then according to Bob's answer,
Physics book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Bob's reply with that of Anu's and Coy's replies, we can infer that
Anu speaks the truth, lies and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Coy lies, speaks the truth and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to Anu, the Maths book does not belong to him and the Chemistry book does not belong to Bob.
Hence under Case 2, Bob always speaks the truth, Anu and Coy alternate between truth and lie and hence this case is not possible since it is given that exactly one of them always speaks the truth, exactly  one of them always lies and the third one alternates between truth and lie, in any order.
Case 3 : Let us assume that Coy always tells the truth. Here we can again make two sub cases.
a) According to Coy's answer,
Maths book belongs to Anu.
Physics book belongs to Bob.
Chemistry book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob lies, speaks the truth and lies respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
b) According to Coy's answer,
Chemistry book belongs to Anu.
Maths book belongs to Bob.
Physics book belongs to Coy.
Comparing Coy's reply with that of Anu's and Bob's replies, we can infer that
Anu lies, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book belongs to him, the Maths book does not belong to Bob and the Chemistry book does not belong to Coy.
Bob speaks the truth, lies and speaks the truth respectively when he says that the Physics book does not belong to him, the Chemistry book belongs to Coy and the Maths book  does not belong to Anu.
This case is also not possible since both Anu and Bob are alternating between truth and lie and there is no one person who always lies.
Hence among the three cases, only Case 1 can be considered to be a valid case wherein Anu always speaks the truth, Bob alternates between truth and lie, Coy always lies and the Chemistry book belongs to Bob.

3...lives on an acre-sized flat field.
4...moves only by jumping; cannot walk, crawl, fly, or move in any manner other than jumping.
5...can jump, in any one jump, a minimum of 6 inches or a maximum of 72 inches (6 feet) across the field (cannot jump straight up-down).  Grobi can therefore, in any one jump, jump any distance across the field at or between the 6-72 inch limits.
6...can jump directly north, south, east, or west only; cannot jump diagonally.
7...must jump four times in any one direction (N-S-E-W) before changing direction (N-S-E-W) or to continue in the same direction (N-S-E-W).
8...dines on mushrooms which grow in the field.  The mushrooms grow to a maximum of six inches in diameter and to a height of an inch.
9...can ingest a mushroom only by landing directly atop the mushroom.
10...is very adept at precisely determining distances.
One day Grobi - happily jumping around in the middle of the field - locates a six-inch diameter mushroom six inches away (center of Grobi to center of mushroom distance) directly west of Grobi.
Grobi quickly (and accurately) calculates that FOUR jumps is the fastest way to get to the mushroom and eat, which Grobi does.
Describe the route taken by Grobi to eat the mushroom including the direction of jumps, each approximate jump-distance, and the specific number of jumps in each direction.","No need to ""invent"" anything new for Grobi such as extraordinary motivating or grasping or ingestion appendages.

No other conditions would solve the puzzle as written:

6. The first set of two digits is a square number (for example 81 is a square number... 9x9).
Hurry, Dad, hurry!""",The numbers in the first set are not higher than 60.,"The solution is 49-21-75-88.
First of all, we know that there are no 0's, 3's or 6's in the combination and that every other digit appears at least once (clue 5).
OK, we'll start on the first set.
We know it's a square number (clue 6).
The only available square numbers that don't have a 0, 3 or 6 in them are:
25
49
81
Now, read clue 3.  This tells us that multiplying the second set of numbers by 2 and then adding 7 will give us the first set.
So you must work backwards from the three numbers we know are the possibilities.
81 - 7 = 74 / 2 = 37.  However, we know there are no 3's in the combination so this can't be right.
25 - 7 = 18 / 2 = 9.  This can't be right, because written down it would be 09 and we know there are no 0's.
So that leaves with 49.
49 - 7 = 42 / 2 = 21.
Now we know this much:
49-21-??-??
Now we must work on the last two sets.
Clue 2 tells us that the third set is 13 smaller than the fourth set.
Here are the possible combinations:
11-24
12-25
14-27
15-28
28-41
29-42
41-54
42-55
44-57
45-58
58-71
59-72
71-84
72-85
74-87
75-88
78-91
79-92
81-94
82-95
84-97
85-98
Now, we must remember clue 5 - this tells us that every number will appear in the combination at least once, apart from 0, 3 and 6.
Currently, we have 1, 2, 4 and 9 in... so that leaves out 5, 7 and 8.
So now we review the list... there are only three possible combinations that include 5, 7 and 8:
58-71
75-88
72-85
Now, we read clue 4.  This tells us the sum of the digits in the fourth set is greater than the sum of the digits in the first set.  The sum of the digits in the first set is 13 (4 + 9), and so the only one greater than that is the 75-88 combination (8 + 8 = 16).
So there we have it.
49-21-75-88.

Biggie's wife, Faerie, was pregnant at the time with what would be the first child for either of them.  Biggie's new will stated that if his child were a boy, the son would get 2/3 of his estate, and his widow would get 1/3.  If the child were a girl, the widow would get 2/3 of the estate, and the daughter would get 1/3.

6. Mrs. Williams partner was her grandfather.
7. Mr. Johnson's partner was a man.",,"From statements 3, 5 and 6 the four couples consist of 3 generations since there is a set of sisters involved and there are grandparents present.
From 2 and 3, the Jones are definitely one of the sisters, and from 6, the Williams are definitely on the 3rd generation. Looking at 1 and 4, the Johnson's are on the 2nd generation and since the Smiths have a daughter, they are on the 1st or 2nd generation. But since the Jones must be one of the sisters, the Smiths cannot fall in the 2nd generation with the Johnson's. Therefore the Smiths are the grandparents.
From 6, Mrs. Williams' partner is Mr. Smith.  From 1 and 6, Mrs. Johnston and Mrs. Williams both have male partners, therefore from 5, Mrs. Smith's partner could have only been Mrs. Jones. Which also means that Jones and Johnson are the pair of sisters.
Thus from 2, Mr. Jones is then partnered with Mr. Johnson, and from 3, Mrs Jones (who is partnered with Mrs. Smith) is playing against Mrs. Johnson (whose partner is Mr. Williams from 1).

186,"You've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of Sildenafil and one tablet of Citrate daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects.
Taking Sildenafil without taking Citrate, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the Sildenafil pills and one of the Citrate pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the Sildenafil bottle, and you tap one Sildenafil pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the Citrate bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Citrates fall into your hand with the Sildenafil pill.
Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the Sildenafil pill apart from the two Citrate pills. The pills look identical. They are both the same size, same weight (10 micrograms), same color (Blue), same shape (perfect square), same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way.

187,"The first chess tournament ended. Bab, Beb, Bib, Bob and Bub became good friends, and returned to their houses.
They told their wives about the tournament. Their wives were also chess players, and they decided to hold another tournament.
This time, each of the 10 players was going to play against each other player once, with an exception that no games were played between the couples. So a total of 40 games would be played.

190,"You are back on the same game show with four other contestants. You didn't realise last time that the winner gets another appearance on the show! You now have another chance to win half a million dollars and become a millionaire! The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues. The first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. When adding the first number of the third set with the second number of the second set, you will get a number below 8.
2. The only digits not used in the code are 5 and 7.
3. When adding the two digits of the first set together, you will not get 10.
4. If you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed.
5. No set has a number above 90.
6. The product of both the digits in the first set is below 30 but above 20.
7. One of the number sets is 66.
8. There is only one 8 in the combination, and it is in the last set.
Now, get cracking!
Warning: Hint shows which set the 66 is in.",??-??-66-??,"The set is 39-21-66-48.
First of all, the second clue tells you there are no 5's or 7's in the combination.
Now we go to the fourth clue. It tells you that if you multiply the second set by 4, you will get the fourth set reversed. There are only a few numbers that will satisfy this:
11, 12, 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Now we skip down to clue 8, which tells us there is one 8 only, and it is in the last set. It could either be the first digit or the second digit.
However, this eliminates these numbers from being in the second set: 11, 16, 23 and 24. Now, only 12, 21 and 22 are the possibilities for being in the second set.
Now, let's look at clue 7. This tells us that 66 is one of the four number sets. We know it can't be in the second, or fourth, and since clue six tells us the product of the two numbers in the first set ranges from 21-29, 66 must go in the third set.
??-??-66-??
Now we must look at the first clue. The first number of the third set (6) plus the second number of the second set will get a number below 8. This means it cannot be 12 or 22, because they would both total 8. This means that the second set of numbers is 21. Making good progress!
??-21-66-??
Now, we come back to clue 4 which tells us the second set multiplied by 4 equals the fourth set reversed. 21 multiplied by 4 is 84, which when reversed is 48!
??-21-66-48
Now, we come back to clue 6, which tells us the product of the digits in the first set is above 20 but below 30. These are the only numbers that satisfy that condition - and remember, no 5's, 7's or 8's are left in the combination:
39 (3 * 9 = 27)
46 (4 * 6 = 24)
64 (6 * 4 = 24)
93 (9 * 3 = 27)
Now, we look at clue 5. This eliminates 93. Now, come to clue 3. This tells us the sum of the two digits in the first set does not equal 10. This eliminates 46 and 64. The only number left is.... 39!

197,"It appears that you have angered the spirit of Halloween by failing to revere the Great Pumpkin, and now a curse has befallen you.  On the walkway to your house is a Ward of Seven Jack O'Lanterns arranged in a circle.  If midnight comes and any of the seven are still lit, a dark reaper and seven dark horses with seven dark riders shall visit thy abode.  They shall surround thy domicile and, while circling it, they will proceed to pelt thy dwelling with eggs and cream of shaving.  And come morn there will be a great mess to be reckoned with.  Verily.  So you better get those lanterns out.
You quickly discover something odd about these lanterns.  When you blow out the first one, the lanterns on either side extinguish as well!  But there is more.  If you blow out a lantern adjacent to one that is extinguished, the extinguished one(s) will relight.  It seems that blowing on any lantern will change the state of three - the one you blew on and its two neighbors.  Finally, you can blow on an extinguished lantern and it will relight, and its neighbors will light/extinguish as applicable.  After trying once and finding all seven lit again, you decide, being the excellent puzzler, you sit down and examine this closer.  But hurry, I hear the beating of many hooves...",,"If you examine the setup carefully, you'll note a number of facts which make the puzzle easier to solve by deduction.  First, blowing on a lantern is a commutative property; blowing on lanterns 1, 5, then 3 is the same as blowing on 3, then 1, and then 5.  No matter what order the lanterns are blown on, if the same lanterns are blown on the same number of times, the result won't change.  For that reason, blowing on a lantern twice is as good as not blowing on it at all.  And three times is as good as one time. So, it seems that it should be able to be done in seven steps or less.
What else can we tell about the solution?  Since each operation changes the state of three lanterns, and there are 7 lanterns, and each lantern must change its state an odd number of times, it's a safe bet that there will need to be an odd number of steps.  We can easily see it can't be done in 1 or 3 steps, so it must be 5 or 7.  Trying 5 steps comes up with 3 different patterns that are not symmetrical and fail to leave all lanterns extinguished.  So that leaves 7 steps and to your surprise, based on the commutative property, the easiest solution is to blow on each one in order!  So doing this, the Great Pumpkin has decided to give you a treat for figuring this out and you find all seven lanterns full of candy the next morning!

The water had caused floods throughout the town and water over six feet deep had forced people to abandon the downstairs of their homes and they had to retreat to the upstairs rooms. The yearly Kebab harvest had been washed away as the downpour had continued unabated for a full month.
Just at that moment Phil's wife, Norma, walked into the bedroom and he commented upon the rain. She replied that she could really care less. No matter how much Phil tried to stress the importance of the rain falling in Madadia, she refused to take it seriously.

199,"I woke up late that morning to welcome a bright sunny day after a long and hectic week. It was a holiday and I was determined to spend the day playing cards with my friend Tweeto. Tweeto's favorite card game was the Romankachi card game.
The rules of the game are as follows :-
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
We started off with 5 cards each and I served in the first round.
At the end of three rounds if I had exactly 4 cards then which of the following statements must be true:-
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
NOTE: Out of the given set of 3 statements, it is not necessary that one and only one statement is true. One or more statements may be true.",,"Statements A and C must be true.
The rules of the Romankachi card game are given below.
1) One person 'serves' and the other 'receives' cards in each round.
2) The person who serves cards in the round gains 2 cards if he wins the round and loses only 1 card if he loses the round.
3) On the other hand, the person who receives cards in the round, gains only 1 card if he wins the round and loses 2 cards if he loses the round.
4) Finally the person who wins in one round, serves in the next round.
5) The game is stopped when a player loses all his cards.
The given statements are
A) Tweeto must have won exactly two rounds.
B) I must have won the first round.
C) Tweeto must have won the third round.
Since we started the card game with 5 cards each and I started of the first round, at the end of three rounds I can have 4 cards due to any one of the following two results.
First Result :
I served in the first round and won. Hence I served in the second round but lost. Tweeto served in the third round and again I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Round 2    6           4
Round 3    4           6
Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is true here because I won the first round.
Second Result :
I served in the first round and lost. Hence Tweeto served in the second round but he lost. I served in the third round and I lost thus ending up with 4 cards.
The number of cards with me and Tweeto is tabulated below.

Applying the given statements  to the above table, we can observe that statements A and C are true since Tweeto won exactly two rounds and Tweeto won the third round. Statement B is false here because I lost the first round.
Hence it is clear from both the results that statements A and C must be true for me to end up with 4 cards at the end of three rounds.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

201,There are 2008 eggs lying in front of you. I am also with you waiting to start the game. The goal of the game is to be the person to take that very last egg (or eggs) to win.

How many eggs must you take initially in order to always win (assuming we both play perfectly)?,"By a perfect game, that means over any two turns, the sum of the number of eggs  you and I take is the same (except of course, excluding the initial move you make).","89 eggs.
In order to see this, look at the smallest way possible to guarantee a win; you leave me with 101 eggs. If I take 1 egg, you take all 100; if I take 100 eggs, you take the last one. Therefore you would always win.
If you try with 202, I can take from 1 to 100, so there is 201 to 102 left. Then you would take 100 or 1 egg(s) in order to leave me with 101 again. By simple analysis, you must take 101 eggs over two rounds in order to get down to 101.

202,"In the purely fictitious land of Fiddledeboox, the Minister of Finance emerged from a top-level meeting.   Reporters had gathered to hear his announcement about either an increase or a decrease in either wages, subsidies or tax levels.

M:  Nothing is going down.

Remember that only one statement can be true.

If (3) is true, either (1) or (2) would be also true.  So (3) is a lie.

207,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo were playing a card game. Each player had three cards, one of the four suits was the ""high suit."" When each player played one card, this was a ""trick."" The first card played in a trick was the ""leading suit."" Here are the cards in each man's hand:
John: club, heart, diamond
Paul: club, spade, spade
George: club, heart, heart
Ringo: spade, diamond, diamond
If possible, each player had to play the leading suit for each trick. If they couldn't do that, they had to play the high suit. And if they couldn't do that, they could play any card. A player who won a trick had to lead the next trick. Each of the three tricks consisted of the leading card, exactly one other card of the same suit, exactly one card of the high suit which won its player the trick, and exactly one other card. Which suit was the high suit?","This makes the puzzle too easy. Please stop reading if you don't want it to be too easy.
Lucy in the sky with...","The high suit is diamonds.
The first trick obviously required two cards of the leading suit, and since everyone had to play the leading suit if possible, there had to be two people who had at least one card of the first leading suit. But since John, Paul, and George each had a club, the first leading suit could not have been a club.
If the first leading suit was a heart, then the high suit had to be a card of which only one of Paul and Ringo had. This means it could only have been a club or a diamond. Similarly, if the first leading suit was a spade, the high suit could only have been a diamond, and if the leading suit was a diamond, the high suit could only have been a heart or a spade.
If the first leading suit was a heart, the second trick was led by either Paul or Ringo, and the leading suit had to be a spade. If the first leading suit was a spade, the second trick was led by John, and the leading suit could have been a club or a heart. If the first leading suit was a diamond, the second trick was led by either Paul or George, and the leading suit was a club. Now we can deduce the six possible leading suits and high suits for the whole game:
1. heart, heart, club
spade, spade, club
diamond, diamond, club
2. heart, heart, diamond
spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
3. spade, spade, diamond
club, club, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
4. spade, spade, diamond
heart, heart, diamond
club, club, diamond
5. diamond, diamond, heart
club, club, heart
spade, spade, heart
6. diamond, diamond, spade
club, club, spade
heart, heart, spade
Game 1 cannot be possible because Paul would have led the spade and John and George would both have played a club, making two cards of the high suit. Games 5 and 6 cannot be possible because no one had both hearts and spades. This leaves only games 2, 3, and 4, which all have diamonds as the high suit.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

212,"A bridge was guarded by an evil troll. The troll was very intelligent, but he was also a coward. He was afraid of anyone smarter than him. So every time anyone tried to cross the bridge, the troll would set up a test. If the traveler passed the test, he would be allowed to cross. Otherwise, the troll would eat him.
Three travelers, Al, Ben and Carl, came across the bridge. The troll told them, ""You may only cross my bridge if you know the password."" He wrote five three-letter words on a rock. The five words were HOE, OAR, PAD, TOE, and VAT.
He then said, ""I will tell each of you a different letter from the password. If you know what the password is, I will let you pass. But don't tell anyone else your letter."" He then whispered a letter from the password to each traveler so that neither of the other two could hear him.
Then the troll asked Al, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Al, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Ben, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Ben, and the troll let him pass.
Then the troll asked Carl, ""Do you know what the password is?"" ""Yes,"" said Carl, and the troll let him pass.
So, what is the password?","1. Ben used Al's answer, and Carl used both Al's and Ben's answers.
2. Al's letter could not have been E.","The password was HOE.
The only letters unique to one of the five words were D, H, P, R, and V. One of these letters must have been Al's, since he could determine the password. The only word without any of these letters is TOE. So the password could not have been TOE.
Ben knew this and now had four words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, P, R, T, and V. The password must have contained at least two unique letters, one for Al and the other for Ben, since they were both able to determine the password. The only word with only one of these letters was OAR. So OAR could not have been the password.
Carl knew this and now had three words to think of. The only letters unique to one word were D, E, H, O, P, T, and V. The password must have included three of these letters, since all three were able to determine the password. The only one of the three words containing three such letters was HOE, so this must have been the password.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

217,"You and your spouse invite four other couples to a party. During the course of the conversation, it is discovered that, prior to the party, each person except you was acquainted with a different number of the people present. Assuming the acquaintance relationship is symmetric (i.e., if you are acquainted with someone, that person is also acquainted with you), then how many people did your spouse know prior to the party? How many people did you know?",,"Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person. Discounting yourself, everyone knows a different number of people, which means that (again, discounting yourself) one person knows one, one person knows two, one person knows three, etc., up to one person who knows nine people (everybody else). Number the people (besides yourself) according to how many people they know, so that person 1 is the one who knows one person, person 2 is the one who knows two people, etc.
Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9.

This leaves person 5, who knows everyone except persons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These five people, therefore, must be persons 6, 7, 8, 9, and you. Since you are the only one of these five not yet paired up, person 5 must be your spouse. So your spouse knew five people prior to the party.

221,"When world-famous Madadian philosopher Torks G'Arbage was imprisoned for being a disturbing influence and relieving himself in a public place, he was held in high esteem by his guards, many of whom had followed Torks' teachings. All four of the guards hoped that something would occur that would facilitate his escape. One evening, the guard who was on duty accidentally on purpose left the cell door open so that Torks G'Arbage could leave for distant parts.
Torks G'Arbage did not attempt to escape, as it was his philosophy that if you accept society's rules, you must also accept its punishments. However, the open door was considered by the Madadian authorities to be a serious matter. It was not clear which guard was on that evening. When questioned, the four guards made the following statements in their defence:
Norris McDim:
A) I did not leave the door open.
B) Morris was the one who did it.

1. The shorter of Al and Ben is the older boxer.
2. The younger of Ben and Carl is the shorter boxer.

Which brother is not a boxer?",,"Carl is not a boxer.
From fact 1, we know that Carl is not the older boxer.
From fact 3, we know that Ben is not the younger boxer.
We now have three possible scenarios:
1. Al is the younger boxer and Ben is the older boxer.
2. Ben is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
3. Al is the older boxer and Carl is the younger boxer.
If scenario 1 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al.
If scenario 2 is true, fact 1 tells us that Ben is shorter than Al; fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al, making Ben shorter than Carl.
If scenario 3 is true, fact 3 tells us that Carl is taller than Al.
We can now expand our three scenarios:
1. Al is the younger, taller boxer, and Ben is the older, shorter boxer.
2. Ben is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
3. Al is the older, shorter boxer, and Carl is the younger, taller boxer.
Scenario 2 cannot be possible because it contradicts fact 2 by making the younger of Ben and Carl the taller boxer.

Everyone exited the building, but when they got back, they found someone had dumped all the sugar into two of the batter-filled bowls.

To start, it can't be Emma or Quinn or anyone who mixed/gave to them. This leaves Flare, Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Watt, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Flare because he exchanged with Alice before Alice exchanged with Emma. It can't be Watt because he mixed with Tina before Tina exchanged with Emma. This leaves Luke, Callie, Gabbi, Misty, and Ryan.
It can't be Gabbi because she mixed with Flare before Flare mixed with Tina who mixed with Emma later. This leaves Luke, Callie, Misty, and Ryan.
If only one of Luke & Callie started with sugar it wouldn't be solvable because no interactions happened before them and the outcome would be the same, therefore the solution is either Misty and Ryan or Luke and Callie.

230,"Walter, Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke crossed a river in a tiny rowboat. They all started on the same side of the river. They made three trips from the starting side to the destination side, and two trips from the destination side to the starting side. Here are some facts:
1. On each trip from the starting side of the river to the destination side, two people were in the boat, but only one person rowed the boat, and that person rowed the boat for the entire trip.
2. On each return trip, only one person was in the boat.
3. Walter is the weakest of the group. He could only row the boat if no one else is in it.
4. Xavier is the second weakest of the group. He can only row the boat if he is by himself or if Yoshi, the lightest of the group, is a passenger.
5. Each man rowed the boat at least once.
Who rowed twice?",,"Yoshi rowed twice.
Fact 5 tells us that Walter had to row the boat at least once, but fact 3 tells us that he had to go by himself. This means he could only row the boat on a return trip, which means he rowed on at least one return trip.
The man who rowed twice could not have rowed on two trips from the starting side to the destination side, because he would have had to make a third trip by himself back to the starting side. So the man who rowed twice must have made a return trip at least once.
Now we know that if Walter made two trips, they must both have been return trips, and Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke each rowed for one of the other three trips. If Walter made only one trip, the other person who made a return trip must have been the person who rowed twice (Xavier, Yoshi, or Zeke) and that person would also have made one of the other three trips. So the three trips from the starting side to the destination side must have been rowed by Xavier, Yoshi, and Zeke.
Fact 1 tells us that Xavier's trip to the destination side must have had a passenger, and fact 4 tells us that that passenger must have been Yoshi. Yoshi would have had to row back to row his trip to the destination side, or else Yoshi rowed to the destination side, then back to the start, then got rowed across by Xavier.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

Then, you figure out that 1 group affects the other group. If there is 1 more person in group x, then there is one less person in group y. So, that means that both group must be even or else both groups are odd and no group will satisfy c). So x must consist of 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, or 86 people and y must consist of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, or 0 people. Now try to make the groups satisfy e). Substitute c for young people and o for old people. The equation is 8o=c. So, o+c equals the number of people in one of the groups. If c=8o, then that will mean o+8o equals the number of people in one of the groups. Then, simplified the equation.
o+8o=9o.
So 9o equal the number of people in one of the groups. So one of the groups has to be a multiple of 9. Since y consists of a group that has 16 people or under, then the only multiple of 9 is 9. But the groups have to consist of an even number of people, so group x must satisfy e). The only multiples of 9 above 70 and under 86 are 72 and 81. But, the number has to be even. So, group x consists of 72 people and y consists of 14 people.
So, the answer is that there are 72 people that went to see the water mill and 14 people went to the beach.",GPT-o3,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 2

240,"You are in a game show with four other contestants.  The objective is to crack the combination of the safe using the clues, and the first person to do so will win $500,000.
The safe combination looks like this:
??-??-??-??
A digit can be used more than once in the code, and there are no leading zeroes.
Here are the clues:
1. The third set of two numbers is the same as the first set reversed.
2. There are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the combination.
3. If you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers, you will get the fourth set of numbers.
4. If you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.
5. The second set of numbers is not greater than 20.
6. The second number in the second set multiplied by the second number in the fourth set equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.
And get moving, I think another contestant has almost figured it out!",,"The combination is 71-19-17-68.
From the second clue, we know that there are no 2's, 3's, 4's or 5's in any of the sets.  Therefore, only 1's, 6's, 7's, 8's and 9's could be in the remaining spots.
Clue 3 says if you multiply 4 by the third set of numbers you will get the fourth set of numbers.  From this, you can tell a 1 is the first number in the third set - any other number would be too high.
11 * 4 = 44
16 * 4 = 64
17 * 4 = 68
18 * 4 = 72
19 * 4 = 76
Of these, 17 * 4 and 19 * 4 are the only ones that are possible; as the answer of the other numbers contains a number which we know is not in the combination.
Now we skip all the way to clue 5, which tells us the second set of numbers is not greater than 20.  This means that the first digit of that set is also a 1.
So far, we know this much:
??-1?-1?-??
Now, we can come to clue 4, which tells us if you add the first number in the first set with the first number in the second set you will get 8.  The first number in the second set is 1, so the first number in the first set must be 7.  Since the first clue tells us the first set is the third set reversed, and we know that a 1 is the first number in the third set, a 1 must be the second number in the first set and a 7 must be the second number in the third set.
So far, we know this much:
71-1?-17-??
Now, the third set (17) multiplied by 4 will get us 68.  Now we know the fourth set is 68.
71-1?-17-68
Now we come to the final clue.  This tells us the second number in the second set (unknown) multiplied by the second number in the fourth set (8) equals one higher than the numbers in the first set.  We know that the first set is 71, so adding one to that (72) and then dividing it by 8 will get us 9.  So, the finished combination is:

244,"In Major League Baseball, the World Series is a best of seven series.  The first team to win four games is the champion.  The Series is scheduled so that one team hosts the first two games and the last two games, while the other team hosts the middle three games.  The World Series ends as soon as one team wins four games, so the Series could be completed in as few as four games.
In this fantasy Series, the New York Yankees played the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Los Angeles hosted the first two games.  The final scores of the games were:
Game 1:  4 to 3
Game 2:  6 to 5 (11 innings)
Game 3:  11 to 7
Game 4:  16 to 9
Game 5:  9 to 6 (10 innings)
Game 6:  2 to 1
Game 7:  13 to 8 (13 innings)
Which team won the World Series?",,"Seven games were played, which means that the teams split the first six games, each team winning three games.  It does not matter who won each of the first six games, since neither team had yet to win four games.  The winner of game 7 will have won four games, and therefore, the World Series.
The team that hosts the first two games also hosts the last two games.  Since Los Angeles hosted the first two games, game 7 was in Los Angeles.  In baseball, the home team bats last.  Los Angeles batted last in game 7.  Since game 7 went 13 innings, Los Angeles would have batted in the bottom of the inning.  In this situation, the home team can never win by more than four runs.  When the home team bats in the last inning, the game ends as soon as the winning run is scored.  The only way the home team can win by more than one run is via a home run, in which case all runners on base at the time can score.  A grand slam home run would only provide a margin of four runs.  Therefore, the home team's margin of victory in an extra-inning game can never exceed four runs.  The final score was 13 to 8, a margin of five runs.  Los Angeles, being the home team, could not have won by that margin.  The game was tied 8 to 8 going into the 13th inning.  New York scored five runs in the top of the 13th inning.

1. Each digit is pressed once and only once.
2. No two consecutive digits are pressed consecutively.
3. The digits 2 and 4 are pressed 2nd and 4th in some order; the digits 6 and 8 are pressed 6th and 8th in some order.

From  clue 4, the sum of the first 4 digits to be pressed, the last 4 digits to be pressed, and two times the 5th digit to be pressed is 19 + 27 = 46. The sum of the first and last 4 digits to be pressed and the 5th digit must be the sum of the digits 1-9, from clue 1. This sum is 45, meaning the 5th digit is 46-45 = 1.
From clues 2 and 3, 2 must be the 2nd digit and 4 must be the 4th digit.
From clue 3, 7 must be the 1st or 3rd digit pressed since it can not be pressed before or after the 6 or 8. From clue 4, this means 5 must be pressed 1st or 3rd. But, from clue 2, it can not be the 3rd digit, so it must be the first, meaning 7 is the 3rd digit pressed.
That leaves 3, 6, 8, and 9 as the last 4 digits to be pressed. If 8 were pressed 8th, then the 9 must be pressed 6th, a contradiction with clue 4.
