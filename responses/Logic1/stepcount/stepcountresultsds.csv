0,"It was good to have the house full of people again; it had been far too quiet since the last of his seven daughters had left for college--seven daughters with seven different majors at seven different schools.  About the only thing they had in common was that they were each dating an athlete, although none of them played the same sport--one was even on his school's fencing team.  He was surprised all the boyfriends had come for Christmas dinner, but he supposed that since he was picking up the tab for the airfare, that a free trip to Hawaii in the winter had something to do with it.  Each of his first three daughters had gone to Ivy League schools--one even to his alma mater at Harvard; his next two ended up at the University of California, at Los Angeles and Berkeley; and his two youngest got accepted to schools abroad--the University of Tokyo had been a bit of a surprise.  Next year, after seven straight years--and for the first time this millennium--he wouldn't be attending a high-school graduation.
""Honey, we're ready to eat.  Can you get Hank, Ian, James and Kyle?  They're in the backyard playing football.  The other boys wanted to test themselves against the star quarterback,"" his wife called from the dining room.
The math major said, ""I'll get them Dad!""
As everyone filed into the dining room, the oldest sister was rehashing the whose-school-and-major-is-better argument with her younger sister about whether Yale or Princeton was a better school and whether history or philosophy was a more useful major.  The argument was practically a Christmas tradition by now.
The table was arranged with the parents at the two ends and each of the couples seated across from each other with boys seated next to girls along each side.  As usual, Angelina and Danica were sitting next to their parents.  Curiously, all the athletes that used a ball in their sport were sitting on the same side of the table.  Christie, Electra and Edward took their seats first.
Once everyone was seated the youngest coyly observed, ""I see the biologist is sitting between the two fighters but I'm sitting between the two best passers at the table.""
""You'd better not make any passes yourself!"" Farrah icily replied.  She hadn't forgiven her sister for stealing her boyfriend when they were in high school and was not happy to see her seated next to her boyfriend now.
""Lighten up, Farrah"" the biology major joked.  ""He wasn't even that cute.""
""He was adorable!"" the youngest interjected.
""Everyone's entitled to their opinion,"" said Brooke.  ""Let's eat!""
The daughter in the middle seat stood up and said, ""We have an announcement to make!"" After a dramatic pause she screamed ""we're getting married!"" and flashed the new diamond ring on her finger.  The youngest sister squealed with delight at the news.  Her fiance joked to his future mother-in-law, ""I think she said yes just so she can wear the monogrammed sweater you gave me for Christmas.""  The baseball player next to her asked her fiance, ""Wow, what'd that rock set you back?""
""This calls for a toast!"" roared Dad.
""Oh Honey, that's wonderful news!"" Mom gushed.  ""I just happen to have some champagne right here.  Lars, I know you don't drink alcohol, but would you mind pouring some champagne for Gabrielle next to you?"" the mother asked, handing the bottle to Lars on her left.  ""Gabrielle, please pass the bottle around,"" she asked and then quickly added, ""But no alcohol for my three babies, or anyone under 21 for that matter.  Honey, there's a store downtown that's having a sale on wedding dresses.  Will you have time to go look at some wedding dresses before you leave?""
""Sure Mom,"" her daughter answered.  ""We have a late flight out, so I can do that on the day we leave.""
""Michael and I are celebrating New Years Eve at the Sheraton, Waikiki,"" one of the girls announced.
""What a coincidence,"" said the boy sitting next to her.  ""We're celebrating New Years at the Sheraton, Los Angeles.  It's within walking distance of our apartment so we won't have to worry if we drink too much.""
""That sounds like a better plan than we have.  Somehow, just because my car holds a lot of people, I got roped into being the designated driver for the team"" Danica said, looking pointedly at her boyfriend, who gestured to the boy from Princeton saying, ""he gave me the idea!""
""Girls, your grandmother will be here on Sunday,"" the father announced.  ""She'd really like to see you all.""
""Sorry Dad,"" the business major replied, ""we have to leave tomorrow.  There's a huge storm predicted to hit the Eastern United States this weekend and we need to get home before they close the airports.  I noticed that each couple is leaving on a different day for six days after we leave.""
""Sir, we're leaving before Sunday also, so we won't be able to make it either.  I'm just glad we don't have to deal with that storm"" said the wrestler.
The swimmer and water polo player announced their travel plans.  One of them remarked that even though his girlfriend and he were departing for Oxford University two days earlier, both couples would get home on the same day.
The physics major said ""I'll be here to see grandma, but unfortunately we're heading back to California before you go look at the wedding gowns.""
""Well I'm glad you'll at least be here to see your grandma, but I wish you could stay longer"" the dad said.  ""You know you're my favorite since you were my first to major in a physical science like me,"" he joked.  ""I have a tee time at the club on Monday, it's too bad you won't be here,"" the father remarked to the golfer.  ""Kyle's got a game next week but you don't,"" he said to the history major's boyfriend.  ""How about you join me on the links?""
""Sure!"" the boyfriend replied enthusiastically.
""Since we're leaving the day after him, if you've got room for two more Dad, we just happened to bring our clubs"" the second oldest said, winking at her boyfriend.
""It's a foursome then!"" her dad said happily.
Ian grumbled, ""Hank you lucky dog, I've wanted to play that course for years!""
The boyfriend of the political science major laughed, ""I'd like to play there also, but Ian, at least I won't have to travel as far as you to get another opportunity.""

Identify the boyfriend and his sport, the school, and major for each daughter.  Name the order that the daughters were born in and the day of the week that they leave to go home.  What is the seating arrangement at the dinner table?
Bonus question: what year is it?","Pay attention to the flow of the conversation, but don't assume more than can be firmly established.
Also, some information relies on the following facts:
Christmas is on December 25th.
New Years Eve is celebrated (usually by drinking too much alcohol) on December 31st.
Swimming, fencing and wrestling are not games.  Football, baseball, water polo and golf are games played with a ball.
Fencing and wrestling are combat competitions.
The game of American football is not a collegiate sport outside the United States; the player that passes the ball is the quarterback; there are more than forty players on a football team.
Water polo is a game played in a pool with 7 players on each team; points are scored by throwing the ball into the opponents net, which is guarded by the goal keeper; the ball is moved across the pool either by swimming with it or passing it to another player.
Ivy League schools are located on the East Coast of the United States.  Harvard, Yale and Princeton are all Ivy League schools.
Oxford University is in Oxford, England.
Tokyo University is in Tokyo, Japan.
Los Angeles and Berkeley are cities in California.
Waikiki is a city in Hawaii.
Hawaii is in the Pacific Ocean.  The following are approximate distances from Hawaii:
Berkeley and Los Angeles ~ 2500 miles
Tokyo ~3900 miles
Yale, Harvard and Princeton ~5000 miles
England ~7000 miles
Biology and physics are physical sciences; none of the other majors is a physical science.
High school in America typically includes the last three or four years of school before college.
A designated driver remains sober in order to drive people who've had too much alcohol home.

1,"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, ""You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.
""In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW.*  The switches are not connected to anything.
""After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.""
""No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.""
""But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.'

Given the information that there is only 1 way to draw a 5-point star, and that there is NO way to draw a 6-point star (in continuous lines, that is), and there are 2 ways to draw a 7-point star, how many different ways are there to draw a 1000-point star?",It's not guess work.

First, let's examine the 5-point star and why there is only that one, described, way to draw it. Starting at A, you cannot go straight to point B, otherwise you will have a pentagon, not a star. Same with point E. AC and AD (and their progressions) yield identical pictures (notice that the last segment in the AC one is DA, literally reverse all the letters to get AD ending in CA).
Now, for a 6-point star, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting at A, we cannot go to B or F, because then we have a hexagon. If we go AC, then we must go CE, then CA... making a triangle, not a 6-point star. Going backwards, AE, EC, EA; mirror image. If we skip 2 points, we go AD, then DA, a straight line, hardly a 6-point star.
For a 7-point star, A-G, AB and AG are not possible, as that's a heptagon. AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA is one way to draw the star, skipping one point in between. Also, AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA, skipping two points in between each, is the other way. The last two line possibilities, AF and AE are mirror images of the two working scenarios.
Examining the above information a little more deeply, we see that we must divide all possible drawings by two, to get rid of the mirror images. Also, we cannot use the point immediately to the left, that is AB as a segment. This explains why there is only 1 way for a 5-point, and 2 for a 7-point, but does not explain the 6-point. Of those remaining points (dealing only with the first half, again, mirror images), those that are factors of the number of total points do not work, because you will end up back at the starting point before hitting every number. AC is a factor in six because it passes point B, so it's 2. AD is a factor of 3 (B, C and D). Not only factors, but multiples of factors, as well (for example, skipping 4 points in the 6-point still does not work).
Using the knowledge of mirrors, first point impossibility (AB) and factors, we see that the number 1000 is made up of 10^3, or 2^3*5^3. Without going through every factor, it's quickly and easily discernible that of the numbers 1-1000, 2 or multiples of it encompass 500 numbers, all evens. Any multiple of 5 includes 200 numbers, half of which end in 0 and are already included with the 2's, so there are 600 unique factors and multiples between 1 and 1000. That leaves us with 400 that are *not*, which should explain how many unique stars we can make. Remember to cut it in half because of mirroring, leaving us with 200, and to discount the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving us with 199. (If you discount AB, and THEN halve it, remember you needed to remove A[Z], the mirror image of that point).",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 8  
Steps:  
1. **Understand the star-drawing rule**: A star is drawn by connecting points with line segments that skip a constant number of points and do not repeat. For example, a 5-point star is drawn by skipping 1 point (AC, CE, EB, BD, DA).  

2. **Analyze the 5-point star**: There is only 1 way to draw it because skipping 1 point (AC, CE, EB, BD, DA) and its reverse (AD, DB, BE, EC, CA) yield identical stars.  

3. **Analyze the 6-point star**: No valid star can be drawn because skipping 1 point (AC, CE, EA) forms a triangle, and skipping 2 points (AD, DA) forms a straight line.  

4. **Analyze the 7-point star**: There are 2 valid ways to draw it—skipping 1 point (AC, CE, EG, GB, BD, DF, FA) and skipping 2 points (AD, DG, GC, CF, FB, BE, EA).  

5. **Generalize the pattern**:  
   - Exclude the immediate neighbor (AB) as it forms a polygon.  
   - Exclude mirror images (e.g., AC and its reverse).  
   - Exclude steps that are factors or multiples of the total points (e.g., for 6 points, skipping 2 or 3 fails).  

6. **Apply to 1000-point star**:  
   - Total possible steps: 1 to 999 (excluding AB).  
   - Exclude factors and multiples of 1000’s prime factors (2 and 5).  
   - Calculate non-excluded steps: 1000 - 600 (factors/multiples of 2 or 5) = 400.  

7. **Adjust for mirroring**: Divide the remaining 400 by 2 to account for mirror images, yielding 200.  

8. **Final adjustment**: Subtract 1 to exclude the AB segment (factor of 1), leaving 199 valid ways to draw a 1000-point star.",,8,"['Total Step Count: 8  \n', '  \n1. **Understand the star-drawing rule**: A star is drawn by connecting points with line segments that skip a constant number of points and do not repeat.

5,"I was playing a game of five card draw poker with a bunch of logicians.  By the time we had finished bidding and were just about to reveal our cards, I was pretty confident I would win of the four of us remaining.  I had three nines, some face card (I can't remember what suit or even whether it was a jack, queen, or king) and a four. (Or was it a five?  I can't remember.)
I was even more sure when two of my opponents laid down their cards.  One had a pair of fours and a pair of sevens, the other had a pair of twos and a pair of eights.  My third opponent, however, laid down his five cards face down in a row.  He said, ""I have a straight, and the cards are, from lowest to highest: a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, and an ace.  I have at least one card of each of the four suits: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds.  I am fairly certain that this is the winning hand, but I'm feeling generous today, and I will give a third of the pot to whoever can determine which suit I have two cards of.
Now I know you can't figure it out without some clues.  Here they are:
1. The king is next to at least one diamond.
2. The queen is next to exactly one heart.
3. The jack is next to at least one spade, but is not next to any hearts.
4. The ten is next to at least one club.
5. The ace does not border any black cards, nor does it border any diamonds.
6. My two cards of the same suit are not next to each other.
7. Of the ten possible pairings of cards, only one pair, when removed, leaves three cards in ascending order from left to right.
8. My ace is not the card on the far left.""
There was a minute's silence.  One of the other logicians said, ""I give up!  There's no way to figure that out!""
The other agreed.  But I didn't.  I had just figured out which suit he had two of.
Which suit is it?","The first step is to determine where the ace goes.
Also, consider this: How could I have figured it out when two expert logicians couldn't?","The two cards on the ends and the card in the middle border a combined number of two suits.  So at least one pair of them should be listed as bordering a card of the same suit in clues 1-5.  Of the five, only the ace and the queen meet this criterion, so they must be two cards apart.  One of them must be in the center, but it can't be the ace (the two cards on the ends would only border hearts - and one of them has to be bordering something else from clues 1-4), so it must be the queen.  The ace is not on the left end from clue 8, so it must be on the right end, and the card next to it must be a heart.  So far we have this(X represents unknown):
X X Q X A
X X X H X
At least one of the two cards to the left of the queen is lower than the queen (two of the remaining cards are lower, and only one can be right of the queen), so the triplet that is in ascending order is the queen, the ace, and the single card to the left of the queen that is lower than the queen.  That means the king is left of the queen, and is also left of both the jack and the ten (otherwise, jack king ace or ten king ace would be a second triplet), so it must be on the far left.  The jack must be left of the ten (or else ten jack ace would be a second triplet), so it must be second from the left, and the ten must be second from the right.  The only card next to the king is the jack of diamonds (it's a diamond from clue 1).  So far we have(T is ten):
K J Q T A
X D X H X
Now we seem to be stuck.  We don't have any more clues that can be used.  So how did I figure it out?
I held a face card (I said so myself in the intro).  I must have known it cannot be that card and deduced the correct answer from there.
But which card did I have?  We already know the suit of the jack, so my holding a jack would not help.  Could I have held a queen?  No, because I know the queen to either be a spade or club (clue 6), so one of the cards next to the queen would have its clue satisfied (see clues 3 and 4), and I could not determine the suit of the card on the other side of it.
Therefore, I must have held a king.  But which king?  I know the king is not a diamond (clue 6) or a heart (clue 3).  If I held the king of clubs, then the king next to the jack would have satisfied the jack's clue, and I could not have determine the suit of either card next to the ten.
Therefore, I held the king of spades.  The king of clubs must have been on the far left (only suit available), so the only card next to the jack that could be a spade is the queen, so the only card next to the ten that could be a club is the ace.  In summary:

6,"Five friends spend every Monday night eating Chinese food from the Golden Dragon. Howard has Mu Shu Pork, Leonard has Spicy Szechuan Tofu, Penny has Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Raj has Beef with String Beans, and Sheldon has Chicken and Broccoli: diced, not shredded, with brown rice, not white, low-sodium soy sauce and the good hot mustard from the Korean grocery.
After dinner, they play a role-playing game called World of Nerds.
In this game, each player takes on a character belonging to a different race of creature, has a different occupation, uses a different sort of weapon, specializes in fighting a particular kind of monster, and has a different skill level.
Can you determine the characteristics of each player's character from the following clues before someone sits in Sheldon's spot?
Players: Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Sheldon
Races: elf, gremlin, halfling, hobbit and ogre
Occupations: archbishop, merchant, paladin, sorcerer and thief
Weapons: bolo, crossbow, dagger, fireballs and mace
Monsters: chimeras, giants, harpies, kobolds and orcs
Skill levels: range from 10-32
Clues:
1. The five characters in the game are Penny's, the 24th-level ogre, the thief, the fireball user, and the one skilled at fighting orcs.
2. The paladin isn't an elf.
3. The bolo user has a skill level twice that of the halfling.
4. Raj's character has a skill level eight levels higher than the paladin, who in turn is eight levels higher than the crossbow user.
5. The hobbit is no good at fighting giants.
6. The elf (who doesn't care for crossbows) is ten levels higher than the one who fights kobolds.
7. The one who is adept at fighting chimeras is four levels higher than Leonard's character (who isn't the archbishop).
8. The character at the lowest level (who isn't Penny) is at level ten and uses a dagger.
9. Neither the archbishop nor the merchant belongs to the race of gremlins.
10. The giant fighter never uses a mace in battle.
11. Raj's character isn't the elf.
12. Penny's character doesn't use the crossbow.
13. Howard's character is not particularly adept at fighting harpies.",Start by determining the 5 skill levels.,"Howard is the halfling and a level 10 thief who fights kobolds with a dagger.
Leonard is the hobbit and a level 16 merchant who fights orcs with a crossbow.
Penny is the elf and a level 20 archbishop who fights chimeras with a bolo.
Raj is the gremlin and a level 32 sorcerer who fights giants with fireballs.
Sheldon is the ogre and a level 24 paladin who fights harpies with a mace.
Explanation:
The first step is to determine the actual skill levels of the five players.
The lowest level is 10, held by the character using a dagger (clue 8).
From (4), the character using a crossbow has an unknown level, let's call it x; the paladin has x+8 and Raj has x+16. Note that x must be greater than 10 and less than or equal to 16, or else x+16 would be greater than 32.
The elf is none of these four players (2, 11, 6), but has a skill level of 10 more than one of them (6). This could be 20, x+10 or x+18.
One skill level has to be 24 (1), two skill levels must have a difference of 4 (7) and one skill level must be twice another (3).
If x=11, then the skill levels are 10, 11, 19, 27 and the elf's is either 20, 21 or 29. None of these is 24; therefore, x isn't 11. Similarly x isn't 12, 13 or 15.
If x=14, then the skill levels are 10, 14, 22, 30 and the elf's is either 20, 24 or 32. This provides a skill level of 24, but for the elf, instead of the ogre; therefore, x isn't 14.
Therefore, x=16 and the skill levels are 10 [dagger], 16 [crossbow], 24 [paladin=ogre], and 32 [Raj]. The elf's skill level must be 20, not 26, in order to satisfy clue (7). This means the elf fights chimeras and Leonard's character uses the crossbow.
Now that we know the skill levels, we can start building a list of the players, starting with the first clue:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = thief
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Since the elf has a skill level of 20, the kobold fighter is level 10 (6), and uses the dagger (8). Penny's character doesn't use the dagger (8), and neither does the ogre, who is level 24. Therefore the thief does:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = orcs
Neither Penny's character (12) nor the ogre (4) uses the crossbow [Leonard], so the orc fighter must:
Player 1 = Penny
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin
Player 3 = level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre can't use the bolo, as no one has level 12 (3), so Penny's character uses the bolo and the thief is the halfling. This leaves the ogre using the mace:
Player 1 = Penny, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
This means that Raj's character, at level 32, must use fireballs, and Penny's character must be the level 20 elf who fights chimeras:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The ogre, who uses a mace, doesn't fight giants (10); therefore the ogre fights harpies, leaving Raj's character as the giant fighter:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, level 32, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, level 16, orcs, crossbow
The hobbit doesn't fight giants (5), so the hobbit must fight orcs, leaving Raj as the gremlin. The gremlin isn't the archbishop or the merchant, and so the gremlin is the sorcerer:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, orcs, crossbow
Leonard's character must be the merchant, rather than the archbishop (7), leaving Penny's character as the archbishop:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs
Player 5 = Leonard, hobbit, level 16, merchant, orcs, crossbow
Howard's character doesn't fight harpies (13), so that falls to Sheldon's ogre, while Howard's halfling fights kobolds. And that completes the list:
Player 1 = Penny, elf, level 20, archbishop, chimeras, bolo
Player 2 = Sheldon, ogre, level 24, paladin, harpies, mace
Player 3 = Howard, halfing, level 10, thief, kobolds, dagger
Player 4 = Raj, gremlin, level 32, sorcerer, giants, fireballs

7,"Mad Ade went on an eight day fly fishing trip around the purple ridged mountains of Madadia and got to fish seven days of it last May. On every day, from May 14 to the 21st, except the 16th, when a severe thunderstorm kept him in his tent, he fished around Madadia. Though he caught many fish--all of which he released--each day, one special fish stood out. Each special fish was of a different variety: Monkey Trout, Brookside Trout, Cut Throat, Dolly Varden, Humpback, Lake Trout, and Rainbow, and a different size: 8 inches, 16 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, 22 inches, 24 inches, and 27 inches. Every day, Mad Ade tried a different secret fishing spot: Big Little Falls, Bottle Well, Deep Channel, Old Cutbank, Big Rock Isle, Dish Creek, and Little Curl. And each special fish was caught on a different fly that Mad Ade tied himself: a Parachute Adams, an Elk Hair Caddis, a Humpy, a MayFly, Mad Ade's Little Mouse, a Stonefly Nymph, and a Yuk Bug. Three of the flies, Mad Ade's little Mouse, the Yuk Bug, and Stonefly Nymph, were fished as wet flies, the rest were fished as dry flies.
1) Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Mad Ade caught either the smallest or his second to largest fish on his third fishing day.
2) Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th. He fought either the Humpback or the 24 inch monster on the 21st. On the fourth day of his trip, Mad Ade landed a fish over twenty inches long by the Old Cutbank on a wet fly. The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls.
3) Mad Ade caught the 24 inch fish on his Little Mouse after he caught the Dolly Varden, but before he hooked a real jumper with his Parachute Adams. Because he preferred dry flies, Mad Ade only used dry flies after using a wet fly on the 19th. Mad Ade used a Mayfly to fish Dish Creek. Mad Ade caught his fish on the Mayfly three calendar days (two fishing days) after he caught a fish with the Stonefly Nymph.
4) Mad Ade's five mile hike, along a mountain trail to Big Little Falls, paid off on his last day with a prized Humpback trout. At least four fishing days passed between the time that Mad Ade used the Stonefly Nymph and his Humpy. The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout.
5) The deep hole of Bottle Well yielded Mad Ade a 19 incher on the first or second day of his trip. With one exception, Mad Ade caught fish of even sizes on even number days and fish of odd sizes on odd days. Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat.",,"Mad Ade caught a fish off Big Rock Isle on the 19th (2).

Only wet fly left is Yuk Bug, so Yuk Bug is 19th.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Elk Hair Caddis can only be 14th.
Parachute Adams, the only fly left, is 20th.
His shiny Dolly Varden was not the fish lured from the depths of Bottle Well. Bottle is 15th, so Dolly is 14th. (1)
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
Brookside, 8 inches, (even) can only be Mayfly or Adams.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls. (2)
Adams can only be Little Curl or Deep Channel. It's not Channel (1) and not Little Curl (2), so Brookside is Dish Creek.
Mad Ade caught the smallest of his special fish, a little Brookside, after he caught the fish on his Elk Hair Caddis, but before he caught the fish in Deep Channel. (1)
So, Deep Channel is 20th, and 14th is Little Curl (last one).
The Monkey Trout Mad Ade caught on the 17th was longer than the Rainbow he caught, but smaller than his Lake Trout. (4) 17th is Monkey, 24 inches, so Lake can only be 27. Only odd without a named fish name is 19th.
So 19th is Lake Trout and 27 inches.
21st is 17 inches, only odd left.
Deep Channel is 22 inches.
The fish Mad Ade landed with a net at Little Curl was larger than the one he worked onto shore at Dish Creek, but it was not as large as the one he lifted from the water at Big Little Falls (2).
Little Curl is less than 17 inches. 16 inches.
Although they both jumped and splashed over the water the same way, the Rainbow Mad Ade caught was bigger than his Cut Throat. (5)
So, Rainbow is 22 inches and Cut Throat 19 inches.

8,"Sailing through a thick fog, you come upon a mysterious island shrouded in mist. A towering volcano in the center of the island pierces the clouds, billowing smoke into the sky. You land your boat and set out to ascend the peak. After an arduous climb, you approach the volcano summit, where lava glows red within a vast crater.
Here, you are approached by three gods and their herald.
Problem
On the summit of this remote volcano, the herald proclaims that you have been selected for a trial. He then lays out the rules for you.
First, you know that one of the three gods always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third will respond to questions randomly. Therefore, let us call the gods True, False, and Random.
Second, the gods speak a different language. They understand all languages perfectly well, but only answer questions with either ja or da, the words for yes and no. You do not know which god is which, and you do not know which word means yes and which word means no.
Finally, you have an existential problem on your hands. You may ask three yes-or-no questions, each one directed to only one god, and only that god will answer with either ja or da. If you can determine the identities of the three gods, they will send you on your way with their blessing, and you can be assured of a prosperous and fulfilled life. If you fail to determine the identities of the gods, however, they will be less generous in their treatment. The volcano pit smokes and glows red beside you.
With your three questions, how do you figure out which god is True, which is False, and which is Random?",Can you phrase a question so that both True and False have to say the same thing?,"First, ask the god standing in the middle, ""If I were to ask you if the god to your left is Random, would you say ja?""
By phrasing questions as hypotheticals, you can ask the gods an embedded question. As long as you ask either True or False, the god will respond with the same word you use (""would you say ja?"") if the answer to the embedded question is affirmative, and the opposite word if the answer is negative.
If the god says ja, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his left is Random, and the god speaking is either True or False; or the god speaking is Random. Either way, you know the god to his right is not Random.
Similarly, if the god says da, then there are two possibilities: either the god to his right is Random, and the god speaking is True or False; or the god speaking is Random. In this case, you know the god to the left is not Random.
The next step is to approach the god that you know is not Random, and figure out if he is True or False. Because you still do not know the meanings of ja and da, you need to do this by using the same hypothetical structure, asking, ""If I were to ask you if you are True, would you say ja?"" If the god is True, they will answer ja. If the god is False, they will answer da. (False's response in this case is essentially either: ""no I would not say yes,"" even though he would; or ""yes I would say no,"" even though he wouldn't.)
Finally, now that you have identified a god as either True or False, you can use the same question structure one last time to identify the other gods (you need to stick to it because you still don't know the meanings of ja and da). Simply ask, ""If I were to ask you if the god in the middle is Random, would you say ja?"" If the answer is ja, then the god in the middle is Random, and the third god is either True or False (the opposite of the one you have already identified). If the answer is da, then the god in the middle is True or False, and the third god is Random.",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 5  
Steps:

11,"Mad Ade, Who had suddenly and unexpectedly after years of selfless dedication to Kebabs, decided to grow some vegetable for himself and subsequently planted his garden late in May. He planted five different vegetables: Tomatoes, Peppers, Radishes, Lettuce, and Broccoli. For each he planted a different number of rows from one to five. The hard work involved with each planting was accomplished on a separate day, from May 25th to May 30th (On Sunday May 26th he didn't work in the garden). Each vegetable was planted in a different part of the garden, the north end, the south side, the east side, the west side or the northwest corner. Can you tell which vegetable was planted in each part of the garden, the day planted and the number of rows?
1. Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch. Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes. Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.  Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of the eastern side of his garden.
2. Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there. On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden. Mad Ade didn't put the peppers or the tomatoes in the northwest corner. Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
3. Mad Ade planted three rows before he planted two rows, but planted them after he planted four rows. Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows. Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce. Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
Which vegetable was planted in how many rows, on which day of May and in which side of Mad Ade's garden?",,"Please Note that 1.1 refers to clue 1, sentence 1, and thus 2.3 would be clue 2 sentence 3.
Explanation:
1.1 Mad Ade turned the soil for the peppers three days after he dug hand-size rocks out of the radish patch.
Radishes are 25th or 27th.
Peppers are 28th or 30th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli
Broccoli is 28, 29 30 (and West is 27, 28, 29)
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
Lettuce 28, 29 30 (and South 27, 28, 29 )
Tomatoes can only be 25th or 27th.
2.2 On one week's last day, Mad Ade planted the east side of the garden.
Saturday the 25th is East.
1.4 Mad Ade believes the morning sun is bad for tomatoes and so kept those plants out of eastern side of his garden
So East, 25th is not Tomatoes.
So Radishes 25th and Tomatoes 27th.
And 3 days later 28th = peppers.
3.4 Mad Ade planted more rows of peppers than he did broccoli (which was not planted in the west side of the garden and was not planted the 29th).
So Broccoli 30th and Lettuce 29th.
1.3 Mad Ade rolled his trusty wheelbarrow into the west end of the garden one day before he planted the broccoli.
West is 29th.
3.2 Mad Ade figured the lettuce wouldn't last long so he planted fewer than three rows.
So Lettuce is one or two rows.
2.4 Mad Ade planted an even number of rows in the Northwest corner of his garden.
Northwest is 2 or 4 rows.
1.2 Mad Ade's bright rows of radishes went deeper than the broccoli but were not as deep as the tomatoes.
Radishes are not one or five.
Broccoli is not five or four.
Tomatoes is not one or two.
2.3 Mad Ade didn't put the peppers nor the tomatoes in the northwest corner.
Northwest is broccoli.
Lettuce has one row.
2.1 Mad Ade labored hard in the south side of the garden and was mighty proud of the three perfect rows there.
So South is three rows.
Radishes are four.
3.3 Mad Ade planted the south garden one day before he planted the lettuce.
So planted 3 in south on 28.
Five rows of tomatoes were planted in the North Garden.

1) Per clue 5, eliminate the appropriate numbers in Column G.  Of the remaining numbers, at least one with a tens digit of 5 will have to be used.  Per clues 1 and 11, only one number can have the numeral 5, so that number must be at G1.  Eliminate all numbers that contain a 5 from all other locations.
2) Per clue 6, eliminate all even numbers from Column O.
3) Per clue 1, eliminate any number from Row 1 with only one digit or duplicate digits.  By analyzing combinations of numbers, the following can be determined: B1 contains a 1, delete 30, I1 contains a 2, delete 23, delete 63 and 73, O1 contains a 6.  In conjunction with clue 3, delete 29 and 59.
4) Per clue 10, analyze the various possible sums of Columns G and O.  The only common prime factor is 31.  Each column must sum to a multiple of 31 (based on available numbers: B to 31, I to 124, N to 155, G to 248, and O to 341).  G1 must be 58.  All two-digit prime numbers (clue 3) must be in Columns G and O.  O1 must be 67.  Per clue 1, N1 must be 39.  Per clue 9, G5 must be 46 and O5 must be 61.
5) For Column N, there is only set of numbers that sums to 155, and satisfies clues 4, 8, and 9 (34, 39, 40, 42).  N5 must be 34.
6) For Column I, there are two sets of numbers that sum to 124, and satisfy clues 8 and 9 (16, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 20, 22, 24, 28, 30).  To satisfy clue 1, I1 must be 24.  B1 must be 10.  To satisfy clue 12, G4 must be 48 and B5 must be odd.
7) The column that satisfies clue 7 is Column B.  To satisfy clue 8, B2 must be 9 and B5 must be 1.
8) To satisfy clue 2, the only square number that can be achieved is 196.  B4 must be 3, I4 must be 30, N4 must be 42, and O4 must be 73.
9) B3 must be 8.  N2 must be 40.
10) To satisfy clue 13, O3 must be 69.  This leaves O2 being 71.  To satisfy clue 3, G3 must be 47.  This leaves G2 being 49.

Brute force methods can be used to arrive at a solution.  However, process of elimination does work.  For example, assign 8 to H.

I would be greater than J, so A would have to be 7 (3 already assigned to J), meaning I would have to be 6.  J is less than A, so B would be 2 (3 already assigned to J).  A is greater than B, so C would be 5 (7 already assigned to A).  The only remaining numeral for G is 0, which means F would have to be greater than G, meaning H would have to be either 1 or 4.  H has already been assigned 8, rendering that assignment impossible.  Continue eliminating possibilities in the order shown below.

15,"The first round of the Children's Battleship Tournament has just been concluded.  Our ten contenders (including Roger and Lila) have just concluded their first five exciting matches.  Each match consisted of two players facing off against each other trying to guess the locations of the other player's ships. (The Carrier covers 5 squares, the Battleship covers 4 squares, the Destroyer and Submarine each cover 3 squares, and the Patrol Boat covers 2 squares.) In the end of each match, only one of the winner's ships remained - and it was a different one in each match!  From the information given, can you determine the full name of the winner and loser of each match, as well as the remaining ship of the winner?
1. Alexis Chartel, although managing to sink her opponent's Carrier and Patrol Boat, still lost; her opponent was not surnamed Roon.
2. The surviving ship of the kid whose last name is Azzuro (who is not Jason) is shorter than the surviving ship of the player that beat the kid surnamed Yeller.
3. The kid who defeated Charlie won because of his or her surviving Submarine.
4. Fred (who is not surnamed Blanc) lost to the kid who's last name is Black (who is not Bart).
5. One of the matches was between the players surnamed Lavender and Tanger.
6. Three - and only three - of the matches were between one boy and one girl.
7. The five games were the one Stacie won (but the loser was not surnamed Chartel), the one Patty lost, the one won by the boy who's last name is Brown, the one lost by the kid who's last name is Blanc, and the one where the only surviving ship was a Patrol Boat (who's last name is not Black).
8. Bart managed to have his Carrier survive the entire game, thus winning his game.
9. The kids surnamed Peach and Lavender had the same result in their matches.
10. Georgia Roon won her match, but not against Patty or Charlie.","In case you need all the kid's names:
The boys are Bart, Charlie, Fred, Jason, and Roger.
The girls are Alexis, Georgia, Lila, Patty, and Stacie.

Charlie lost the game where the surviving ship was the Submarine.  From clue 4, Fred lost to Black.  From clue 8, Bart won the game where the surviving ship was the Carrier; from clue 4, he is not Black, and from clue 1, he did not defeat Alexis, so he was in a fourth game.  From clue 10, Georgia's last name is Roon, and she won, but not against Charlie, and from clue 1, not against Alexis, so she was in a fifth match.  So five matches are:
_____ _____ beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
Bart   _____ beat _____ _____ by a Carrier.
_____ _____ beat Charlie _____ by a Submarine.
_____ Black beat Fred _____ by a _____.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a _____.
Patty did not lose to Georgia (clue 10); she lost to Bart.  Alexis Charlet was not defeated by Stacie (clue 7), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 1); she was defeated by Brown (only one left in clue 7).  Fred is not Blanc (clue 4), nor was the surviving ship the Patrol Boat (clue 7); he was defeated by Stacie (only one left in clue 7).  Charlie is Blanc (only one left in clue 7), so Georgia Roon won with her Patrol Boat (only one left in clue 7).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred _____ by a _____
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartel by a _____.
_____ _____ beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only match in which Lavender and Tanger could face each other is the one where Bart beat Patty - but we don't know which last name goes with which kid.  The only remaining winner that Azzuro could be is the one that beat Charlie.  Yeller cannot have lost to Georgia (Patrol Boat is shorter than Submarine - clue 2); he is Fred, and his opponent won with a Battleship (only remaining ship longer than a Submarine - clue 2), so Brown beat Alexis with a Destroyer (only ship left).  Meaning:
Stacie Black beat Fred Yeller by a Battleship.
Bart _____ beat Patty _____ by a Carrier.
_____ Brown beat Alexis Chartrel by a Destroyer.
_____ Azzuro beat Charlie Blanc by a Submarine.
Georgia Roon beat _____ _____ by a Patrol Boat.
The only place for the last name Peach is as the kid who lost to Georgia.  Since Peach lost, Lavender must have lost (clue 9) and Tanger must have won.  Two of the matches are known to be between a boy and a girl.  The other three must be one between a boy and a girl (clue 6), one between two boys (two of the unplaced kids are boys, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match), and one between two girls (two of the placed kids with unplaced opponents are girls, and only one of them could be in the third boy/girl match).  Charlie must be facing a boy who's last name is Azzuro, but it's not Jason (clue 2); it's Roger.  Brown cannot be Lila (clue 7); he's Jason, so Lila is Peach (only possibility).

16,"Einstein's Riddle:
Einstein wrote the following riddle. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it's not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:
1.	The Brit lives in the red house.
2.	The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3.	The Dane drinks tea.
4.	The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5.	The green house's owner drinks coffee.
6.	The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
7.	The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
8.	The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
9.	The Norwegian lives in the first house.
10.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
11.	The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
12.	The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
13.	The German smokes Prince.
14.	The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
15.	The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?",Just take your time. This one should take you some time and is probably one of the harder riddles you see.,"The German sits in his Green House, smoking his Prince cigars, drinking coffee, and watching his FISH.

Assume that, typically:  animals have 1 head, snakes have 0 legs, birds have 2 legs, mammals have 4 legs, insects have 6 legs, and spiders have 8 legs.  Zachary has some unusual animals in his zoo.  He has:  a snake with 3 heads, a bird with 2 heads, a mammal with 3 legs, an insect with 4 legs, and a spider with 7 legs.  From the following information, determine how many of each group of animals that Zachary has in his menagerie.
1) There are a total of 100 heads and 376 legs.
2) Each group has a different quantity of animals.
3) The most populous group has 10 more members than the least populous group.
4) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs.
5) There are as many snake heads as there are spider heads.",,"A) Since there are 3 extra heads (2 snake and 1 bird), there are only 97 animals (clue 1).

B) There are twice as many insect legs as there are bird legs (clue 4).  To find the possible bird and insect group sizes, multiply the quantity of insects by 6 (legs per insect).  Subtract 2 (an insect is missing 2 legs).  Divide by 2 (twice as many insect legs as bird legs).  Divide by 2 (legs per bird) to get the quantity of birds.  The formula is:  B = ((I * 6) - 2) / 4.  There are three combinations that work:  13 and 19, 15 and 22, 17 and 25.
((13 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 19 birds
((15 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 22 birds
((17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs) / 4 = 25 birds
Of the 17 sets (from step A), only 5 contain these sizes.
13, 19, 20, 22, 23 (13 insects & 19 birds)

15, 17, 19, 21, 25 (17 insects & 25 birds)
C) There are as many snake heads as spider heads (clue 5).  Since there is a snake with two extra heads, there are actually 2 fewer snakes compared to spiders.  Only 2 combinations (from step B) yield the required head count.
13 insects, 19 birds, 20 snakes, 22 spiders, 23 mammals
15 mammals, 17 insects, 19 snakes, 21 spiders, 25 birds
D) The only group combination (from step C) that produces 376 legs (clue 1) is:  15, 17, 19, 21, 25.  The other combination yields 380 legs.
(15 mammals * 4 legs/mammal) - 1 missing leg = 59 legs
(17 insects * 6 legs/insect) - 2 missing legs = 100 legs
19 snakes * 0 legs/snake = 0 legs
(21 spiders * 8 legs/spider) - 1 missing leg = 167 legs
25 birds * 2 legs/birds = 50 legs
Thus, there are:  19 snakes (21 heads and 0 legs), 25 birds (26 heads and 50 legs), 15 mammals (15 heads and 59 legs), 17 insects (17 heads and 100 legs), and 21 spiders (21 heads and 167 legs).  This produces 97 animals with 100 heads and 376 legs.",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 4

A bit of an eccentric, Detective Y had an usual methodology when it came to solving crimes. Knowing witnesses to be often be mistaken and contradictory, Y made a habit of asking his witnesses to state to him only one fact they remembered clearly and with absolute certainty from the moment the crime took place.
Y wasted no time upon arriving and, after taking a quick overview of the scene, asked each of the ten remaining passengers in turn to state one absolute fact from the moment right before lights went out in the two train cars. His interview notes are as follows:
Ms. S:  I was dining with Mr. J.
Mr. G:  There were the same number of men and women in my car.
Mr. J:  Mr. K was not in the dining car.
Ms. L:  Mr. Q had just entered my car.
Mr. F:  Ms. W and Ms. P were talking to one another in hushed tones.
Mr. R:  Mr. G was not in the passenger car.
Mr. Q:  There were fewer women in my car than the other.
Ms. P:  Ms. L was not in the same car as me.
Mr. K:  Ms. P was in the passenger car.
Ms. W:  Mr. F was avoiding Mr. R and hiding behind a newspaper in the opposite car.
The bewildered conductor watched as Detective Y completed his interviews, scribbled a few more lines in his notes, and turned to announce he had solved the case.
""But surely you can't have figured out the identity of a murderer simply from a list of seating arrangements?"" the conductor protested. ""You haven't even been told in which car the victim was seated!""
""To the contrary, my good man,"" the detective answered placidly. ""It is the curse of a criminal that he must answer any question regarding the crime he has committed with a lie. The innocent tell only truths, but the lone murderer has been betrayed by his testimony.""
Who did Detective Y arrest?","Like any good Detective, Y always assumes everyone he interviews is telling the truth until proven otherwise. He also knows the simplest explanation is always the best. He compares the witness statements until he discovers the scenario that is accurately described by nine truthful witnesses and arrests the liar.","Y began by assuming everyone was telling the truth about each other's location and came up with the following arrangement: S J L Q G R (4 men, 2 women) in the dining car and K P W F (2 men, 2 women) in the passenger car. (R and F are interchangeable in this scenario, but as both are men, the precise position of each is irrelevant to this point.) This contradicted both G's statement that there were an equal number of men and women in his (the dining) car and Mr. Q's claim that fewer women were in one car than the other.
Thus, the detective concluded both G and Q were telling the truth and someone was lying about the occupancy. Y reasoned that only one possible configuration could make both men's testimonies true: G, 2 other men, and 3 women in one car and Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman in the other.
Because G and Q had to have been in opposite cars, Y worked back up his witness list to find the lie that had placed Q in the wrong car. He first examined L's statement that she and Q shared the same car. If this alone was the lie, it would leave S J L G R (3 men, 2 women) in the dining car and put K P Q W F (3 men, 2 women) in the passenger car, meaning G and Q's statements still would be inaccurate.
Ms. L must be telling the truth then, and Y instead turned to P's claim, which had placed L (and Q by extension) in the other car. If P was lying, it would mean only S J G R (3 men, 1 woman) were in the dining car and K P L Q W F (3 men, 3 women) were in the passenger car. Again, neither G or Q's statements are met.
Detective Y, now certain Mr. G, Mr. Q, Ms. L, and Ms. P were all telling the truth, backtracked to Mr. K next, who had established P's position. Assuming K a liar, Y was able to place S J P G W R (3 men, 3 women) in the dining car and K L Q F (3 men, 1 woman) in the passenger car.
A prudent man, Y double checked his work by running each remaining statement against his reasoning and stiffened his resolve upon finding K to be the only possible person whose lone lie could make every other witness statement truthful.
Mr. K was arrested and led away to the relief (albeit, slight puzzlement) of the conductor and his passengers.",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 7

Steps:
1. **Initial Assumption**: Detective Y assumes everyone is telling the truth and creates an initial arrangement of passengers in the dining car (S, J, L, Q, G, R: 4 men, 2 women) and passenger car (K, P, W, F: 2 men, 2 women). This contradicts G's statement (equal men and women in his car) and Q's statement (fewer women in one car than the other).

2. **Truthful Statements Identified**: Y concludes G and Q must be telling the truth, as their statements cannot both be false under the initial assumption. Thus, the correct configuration must satisfy both G's statement (equal men and women in his car) and Q's statement (fewer women in one car than the other).

3. **Revised Configuration**: Y deduces the only possible configuration that satisfies both G and Q's truthful statements: one car has G, 2 other men, and 3 women (equal men and women), and the other car has Q, 2 other men, and 1 woman (fewer women than the other car).

4. **Testing Ms. L's Statement**: Y tests if Ms. L's statement (she and Q shared the same car) is a lie. This leads to an arrangement that still contradicts G and Q's truthful statements, so Ms. L must be telling the truth.

5. **Testing Ms. P's Statement**: Y tests if Ms. P's statement (she and L were not in the same car) is a lie. This also leads to an arrangement that contradicts G and Q's truthful statements, so Ms. P must be telling the truth.

6. **Testing Mr. K's Statement**: Y examines Mr. K's statement (Ms. P was in the passenger car). Assuming K is lying (and thus P is not in the passenger car), Y arrives at an arrangement that satisfies all truthful statements: dining car (S, J, P, G, W, R: 3 men, 3 women) and passenger car (K, L, Q, F: 3 men, 1 woman). This aligns with G and Q's truthful statements.

22,"The Situation:
There is an island with 10 inhabitants. One day a monster comes and says that he intends to eat every one of them but will give them a chance to survive in the following way:
In the morning, the monster will line up all the people - single file so that the last person sees the remaining 9, the next person sees the remaining 8, and so on until the first person that obviously sees no one in front of himself. The monster will then place black or white hats on their heads randomly (they can be all white, all black or any combination thereof).
The monster will offer each person starting with the last one (who sees everyone else's hats) to guess the color of his/her own hat. The answer can only be one word: ""white"" or ""black"". The monster will eat him on the spot if he guessed wrong, and will leave him alive if he guessed right. All the remaining people will hear both the guess and the outcome of the guess. The monster will then go on to the next to last person (who only sees 8 people), and so on until the end.
The monster gives them the whole night to think.
The Task:
Devise the optimal strategy that these poor natives could use to maximize their survival rate.
Assumptions:
1) All the 10 people can easily understand your strategy, and will execute it with perfect precision.
2) If the monster suspects that any of the people are giving away information to any of the remaining team members by intonation of words when answering, or any other signs, or by touch, he will eat everyone.
3) The only allowed response is a short, unemotional ""white"" or ""black"".
4) Having said that, I will add that you can put any value you like into each of these words. For example, ""white"" can mean ""my mother did my laundry"" and ""black"" can mean the guy in front of me is wearing a black hat.","1) First hint is an example. Here is a simple strategy that will guarantee safety to 50%. Guy #10 (when he guesses) says the color of the hat on guy #9. Thus #10 may die or may luck out, but #9 will save himself since he will know his hat color. Thus #8 helps #7, #6 helps number #5, and so on. You thus save numbers 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1, or half the people. But you can do a lot better than that.
2) The best strategy will save a minimum of 90% of the people.","Here it is: The first guy to guess (guy #10) will be the only one to assume the following value for the words ""white"" and ""black"": The answer ""black"" will mean that there are an odd number of black hats that he sees. The answer ""white"" will mean that there are an odd number of white hats that he sees. This way one by one all the other 9 people will know the color of their hats.
Let us say that guy #10 (first to speak, and sees the hats of the remaining 9) says ""white"". That should mean to everybody else that he sees an odd number of white hats. At this time guy #9 will either be wearing a white or a black hat. If he is wearing a white hat he will only see an even number of white hats, and since guy #10 said that there is and odd number of white hats, guy #9 will know that he is wearing white and will say it. But if guy #9 is wearing a black hat, he will see an odd number of white hats (just like #10 did), and thus will know that he is wearing a black hat and will say it. No matter what #9 answers, guy #8 (who heard guy #10 and guy #9) can now easily incorporate the color of hat on guy #9 into the original answer of guy #10. This will allow #8 to know if he should see an odd or even number of white hats in front of him to determine his own hat color. The same thing repeats with #7-1. And they all get it right except of course #10, though he may get lucky.",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 6

Steps:
1. **Agree on a Communication Protocol**: The group decides that the first person to speak (Person #10) will use their answer to communicate the parity (odd or even) of the number of black hats they see.

2. **Person #10's Turn**: Person #10, who can see all 9 hats in front of them, counts the number of black hats. If the count is odd, they say ""black""; if even, they say ""white."" This answer is their best guess, but it also serves as a signal for the rest of the group.

3. **Person #9's Turn**: Person #9, who can see 8 hats, listens to Person #10's answer. They count the number of black hats they see and compare it to the parity indicated by Person #10.

4. **Subsequent Turns (Persons #8 to #1)**: Each subsequent person listens to all previous answers and keeps track of the number of black hats already announced. They use this information, along with the initial parity from Person #10, to deduce the color of their own hat by counting the visible black hats and comparing the total to the initial parity.

5. **Execution of Deduction**: Each person from #9 to #1 uses the cumulative information from prior answers to correctly determine their hat color, ensuring their survival.

23,"""Congratulations, Great-Aunt Nora!""  The voice of Victor Summ, her eldest nephew, was tired, but exultant.  Her older sister was the first grandparent among the five Shekrie siblings.
""Let me put you on speaker-phone, Vic.  Corman is here.""  Nora had little doubt that her romance with a math teacher was the reason Victor, a research statistician, called personally, instead of letting his mother handle the news.
Nora beamed at Corman as she hit the button.  ""You're on, 'Daddy'.  Mother and children are doing fine?""
""Cogita's doing great, although we had a bit of a shuffle in the maternity ward.  Hi, Professor diNoni -- you'll love this one.""
""Hi, Victor.  I've heard more about you than ... no, you've known your aunt longer.  You probably know how much she's talked about you.""
""It runs in the family,"" he smiled across two time zones.  ""Doc Matter, our OB, said it was the strangest coincidence she's seen in a decade.  The kids were born 10, 20, 30, minutes apart, up to an interval of an hour-fifty ..."" Vic's voice trailed off.
""Except for one interval?""  Corman filled in.
""Right.  She said it was really weird, watching the time.  She said Adele was born at six sharp, Brand at 6:10, and they just kept hitting 10-minute multiples, until Elana came out at 7:50.""
Nora yelped.  ""You had *eleven*,"" then her left brain caught up, ""no, just the quintuplets.  Sorry.""
""De nada, Aunt Nora.  But that's where the problems started: they had the birth order mixed up.  Someone had assumed we'd named them in order, with Brand, Caleb, and Derec in between.  I pointed out that they'd managed to get all five wrong, and then Cogita wanted me.""
""So they got it sorted out?""
""Not quite.  The OB saw to the post-delivery stuff while we beamed at each other.  Then a nurse came in and said they figured it out: we'd named them in alphabetical order, but by the last letter of their names.  They had all five wrong again!  Heck, even if we'd done it in reverse alphabetical order, either way, they would have had all five wrong!""
""So what did they do?""
""Doc Matter said she may be getting gray, but she wasn't going to sign the certificates until they were all correct.  She dictated the birth times and told them to match them with the weight and length stats to sort things out -- and if they couldn't, they shouldn't bother reporting for work after tonight.""
He took a cleansing breath.  ""On a happier note, we'd like the blood aunts and uncles to serve as godparents, since there are five of you.  Would you stand for Caleb, Aunt Nora, since the two of you have the same birth position in the family?""
""I'd love to.  And if anyone in this family declines, I'll have Corman make them figure out the birth order.  Do you have it yet, dear?""
Vic broke in, ""He doesn't have enough information yet, and I can hear you smirking at him.""
Corman held up a hand to keep her quiet.  ""Since I don't know much about Nora's birth order, I'll have to make this a bigger question.  How far apart were Brand and Elena born?""
""Fifty minutes, on their cute little noses.""
""Got it.""  Corman recited the birth order, complete with times.  Can you do the same?","There is only one way (plus a mirror-image reflection) to arrange ten different intervals in a span of 11 ten-minute units.  If you need help, search for ""Optimal Rulers"".","6:00	Derec

Method:
Number the ten time points from 0 to 11 (6:00 to 7:50).

The clue gives three birth times at 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50, so we have the first arrangement.
The clues about alphabetic and reverse-alphabetic order giving five wrong placements mean that Caleb and Derek were not born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th; Adele and Elena were not born first or last, and Brand was not born 2nd or 4th.
The 50-minute interval given at the end means puts Brand and Elena into the 3rd & 4th spots, which leaves 2nd as the place for Adele.

### Total Step Count: 7

### Steps:
1. **Identify the Time Points**: Number the time points from 0 to 11 (representing 6:00 to 7:50 in 10-minute intervals). The only valid arrangements to ensure all birth intervals are unique are events at points 0, 1, 4, 9, and 11 or the reverse (11, 10, 7, 2, and 0). 

2. **Use Given Birth Times**: The problem provides three birth times: 6:00, 6:10, and 7:50. This corresponds to points 0, 1, and 11, confirming the first arrangement (0, 1, 4, 9, 11).

3. **Apply Alphabetical Order Constraints**: The clues about alphabetical and reverse-alphabetical order imply:
   - Caleb and Derec cannot be born 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
   - Adele and Elena cannot be born first or last.
   - Brand cannot be born 2nd or 4th.

4. **Determine Brand and Elena’s Positions**: The 50-minute interval between Brand and Elena (given at the end) places them in the 3rd and 4th spots (points 4 and 9). 

5. **Place Adele**: Since Adele cannot be first or last, and the 2nd spot is the only remaining position for her, she is placed at point 1 (6:10).

6. **Assign Caleb and Derec**: The remaining spots (first and last) must be filled by Caleb and Derec. Since Caleb shares Nora’s birth position and Nora is not the firstborn (as Cogita is her older sister), Caleb cannot be first. Thus, Derec is first (6:00), and Caleb is last (7:50).

7. **Final Birth Order and Times**: Compile the birth order with times:
   - 6:00: Derec
   - 6:10: Adele
   - 6:40: Brand
   - 7:30: Elena

Beauty's mom could not be three because she won in the Derby before. The oldest black is even older than BEAUTY's mom.
BEAUTY's aunt could not be three. If she were, then SNOWY must also be three to complete the three entries this year.

If [AGC] = 931, then D must be either 0 or 7 (clue #1) and J must be either 0 or 7 (clue #2).  Therefore, between them, D and J must use 0 and 7.  E and F must both be odd (clue #4).  However, four of the odd numerals would already be assigned (A = 9, G = 3, C = 1, either D or J = 7).  Therefore, [AGC] can not be 931.  This means that [AGC] must be 421.  Therefore, A = 4 and G = 2.
Since G = 2, then J = 8 (clue #2).  J can not be 1 or 4, since those two numerals are now assigned.
The only remaining letters that can be assigned to 6 are B and I.  D can not be 6, as it would not produce a square number (clue #1).  Neither E nor F can be 6, since that would not produce an odd number (clue #4). H can not be 6, as it would not produce a prime number (clue #5).  Since either B or I must be 6, then 6 must be paired with 0 (clue #3), as the other even numerals have now been assigned.
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then D = 5 (clue #1).
Since B and I share 0 and 6, then E and H must also be separated by 6 (clue #7).  The only remaining numerals that satisfy this requirement are 3 and 9.  This means that F = 7.  This sets H = 3 and  E = 9, which then sets B = 6 and I = 0.",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 10  
Steps:  
1. From clue #5, deduce that either C or H must be 1 because the product of two numbers is a prime number.  
2. From clue #6, determine that the numerals [AGC] must be one of the following combinations: 931, 421, or 842.  
3. Eliminate [AGC] = 842 because it would require D = 1 (from clue #1), but D cannot be 1 if C or H is 1. Thus, [AGC] must be 931 or 421, and C = 1.  
4. Eliminate [AGC] = 931 because it would require D and J to be 0 or 7 (from clues #1 and #2), but this would leave no valid odd numerals for E and F (from clue #4). Thus, [AGC] = 421, A = 4, and G = 2.  
5. From clue #2, since G = 2, J must be 8 (as 1 and 4 are already assigned).  
6. From clue #3, since B and I must be even and the remaining even numerals are 0 and 6, assign B and I to 0 and 6.  
7. From clue #1, since A = 4, D must be 5 (as 4 + 5 = 9, a square number).  
8. From clue #7, deduce that E and H must differ by 6 (since B and I are 0 and 6). The remaining numerals that satisfy this are 3 and 9.  
9. Assign H = 3 (since C = 1 and H must be a factor of a prime product) and E = 9.

26,"Did you know that the mango is one of the world's most popular fruits? The mango is grown in North, South and Central America, the Caribbean, south and central Africa, as well as its native southern and south-east Asia.
The mango is also packed with vitamins A, B and C.
While eating a mango the other day, I started thinking about the ABC's. Then I remembered the set of 5-sided alphabet pyramids I had as a child.
Here are some 5-letter words that can be spelled with just 5 of my pyramids:
BELOW
CANDY
FORTY
HELIX
JABOT
LEMON
LIGHT
MANGO
OCHRE
PEACH
QUEST
QUICK
VIEUX
Using these words, can you figure out which letters appear on each pyramid?",,"Let's start with the word MANGO, and assign a number to each pyramid.
1: M
2: A
3: N
4: G
5: O
The word LEMON shares 3 letters with MANGO, so the L and E must go with the A and G, in some order. Because of the word PEACH, the E and A cannot be on the same pyramid, so the E must be on pyramid 4, while the L is on pyramid 2.
Because of the word OCHRE, neither the C or H of PEACH can be on the same pyramid with the O, so the P must be on pyramid 5.
Because of the word CANDY, the C cannot be on the same pyramid as the N, so it is with the M, leaving the H with the N. The Y cannot be with the O (FORTY), so it must be with the G, and the D is with the O. The R must then be on pyramid 2, to complete OCHRE.
1: M, C
2: A, L, R
3: N, H
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D
The F and T of FORTY must be on pyramids 1 and 3, but the H and T cannot be on the same pyramid (LIGHT), so the T is on pyramid 1 and the F is on pyramid 3. This means that the I must be on pyramid 5, in order to complete LIGHT.
1: M, C, T
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F
4: G, E, Y
5: O, P, D, I
The J and B of JABOT must be on pyramids 3 and 4, but the B cannot be with the E, or else one cannot spell BELOW. Also, the W must be on pyramid 1.
1: M, C, T, W
2: A, L, R
3: N, H, F, B
4: G, E, Y, J
5: O, P, D, I
The X in HELIX must be on pyramid 1, so we now have all the letters on that pyramid. There is only one letter left on pyramid 3, and it must be in VIEUX, QUEST and QUICK, so it must be the U. The V from VIEUX must therefore be on pyramid 2.
The Q cannot be on the same pyramid as the I, in order to spell QUICK, so it is also on pyramid 2. The S cannot be on the same pyramid as the E (QUEST), so is therefore on pyramid 5, and the K is the last letter on pyramid 4.
1: M, C, T, W, X
2: A, L, R, V, Q
3: N, H, F, B, U
4: G, E, Y, J, K
5: O, P, D, I, S",DSChat,stepcounter,"Total Step Count: 14

Steps:
1. Assign the letters M, A, N, G, O to pyramids 1 through 5 respectively based on the word MANGO.
2. Analyze the word LEMON and deduce that L and E must be on pyramids 2 and 4, since E and A cannot be on the same pyramid (from PEACH).
3. From OCHRE, determine that P must be on pyramid 5, since C and H cannot be with O.
4. From CANDY, assign C to pyramid 1 (cannot be with N), H to pyramid 3, Y to pyramid 4, and D to pyramid 5.
5. Assign R to pyramid 2 to complete OCHRE.

28,"Carl, Draco, Emma, Ivy, June, & Xavior are playing a game with you in which you have to guess their roles in exactly 16 statements.
The roles are:
Normal - Has no abilities
Liar - Knows all roles & has to lie
Detective - Knows all roles
Switcher - Switches 2 roles after the first statement (cannot switch themselves)
Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)
Spy - Knows who was switched
The following 16 statements were made:
Carl is not Cupid - June
Ivy is the Liar - Carl
I know someone's role - Draco
I know the Switcher - Xavior
Ivy is not Normal - Emma
I wasn't switched - Ivy
Emma knows Draco's role - June
Xavior knows who was switched - Carl
Emma & I are not the Spy - Draco
Draco or June is Normal - Xavior
I don't know the Spy - Emma
I'm the Spy - Ivy
The Cupid wasn't switched - June
Xavior isn't Cupid - Carl
I don't know the Detective - Draco
I'm not the Spy - Xavior
Who is who?
*The Detective/Liar knows who was switched; if the Detective/Liar is switched then only the new Detective/Liar is updated",,"Normal=Draco
Liar=Ivy
Detective=Xavior
Switcher=Emma
Cupid=June
Spy=Carl
Explanation:
Step 1: Draco, Xavior, & Emma are telling the truth
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, otherwise Carl is lying
Since Carl or Ivy is lying & there is only 1 liar, the other are honest
Step 2: June is telling the truth (can't prove the 1st statement yet)
""Ivy is the Liar - Carl""
If Carl is telling the truth then Ivy is lying, if Carl is lying then Carl is lying
However, since June is the 1st one to talk, June could have been swapped and started as the liar
Step 3: Emma is paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
This leaves 5 scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
3. Emma is the Liar & is paired with June
4. Emma is the Liar & June is the Detective
5. June is lying
Statements 3-5 can't be true since Emma & June are telling the truth; therefore Emma is paired with Draco or June
Step 4: Emma isn't the Cupid or Normal
""Cupid - Pairs 2 players and lets them see each other's roles (cannot pair themselves)""
Cupid can't pair themselves
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Emma can't be Normal
Step 5: Emma isn't the Detective or Spy:
""I don't know the Spy - Emma""
If Emma was the Detective or Spy, then Emma would know the Spy
This leaves Emma with Switcher
Step 6: June is Cupid & Draco is Paired
""Emma knows Draco's role - June""
We had 2 possible scenarios:
1. Emma is the Detective & is paired with June
2. June is Cupid & paired Draco & Emma
However, Emma isn't the detective; therefore Draco & Emma are paired by June the Cupid
Step 7: Draco = Normal
""Draco or June is Normal - Xavior""
June is Cupid & Xavior is telling the truth; therefore Draco is Normal
Step 8: The final 3
""I'm not the Spy - Xavior""
This leaves the Detective.
""Xavior knows who was switched - Carl""
This is true, which means Ivy is the liar & Carl is the Spy.
