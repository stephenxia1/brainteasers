{\large\bf Problem}

Six villages are situated at the vertices  
\[
\V_0,\;\V_1,\;\V_2,\;\V_3,\;\V_4,\;\V_5
\]
of a regular hexagon, listed in clockwise order.  
Every pair of distinct vertices is joined by a straight path, so that the
$\binom{6}{2}=15$ segments form a complete graph inscribed in the hexagon.
These segments cross in exactly $13$ interior points, one of which is the
center of the hexagon.

Fix two distinct vertices $\V_i$ (the \emph{start}) and $\V_j$ (the
\emph{destination}).  
A \emph{monotone route} from $\V_i$ to $\V_j$ is a polygonal path that

\begin{itemize}
    \item is contained entirely in the union of the $15$ straight segments,
    \item starts at $\V_i$ and ends at $\V_j$,
    \item turns only at the $6$ vertices or at the $13$ interior
          intersection points, and
    \item is \emph{strictly approaching} $\V_j$:   
          every point reached on the route is closer to $\V_j$
          (in the usual Euclidean distance) than the point immediately
          preceding it.
\end{itemize}

Beginning on April $1$, three travelers all depart from $\V_0$ but head for
different destinations:
the first toward $\V_1$, the second toward $\V_2$, and the third toward
$\V_3$ (the first, second, and third clockwise vertices after $\V_0$,
respectively).  
Each traveler walks exactly one monotone route per day and must eventually
use \emph{every} monotone route from $\V_0$ to his own destination.  
The wedding of a traveler is held on the calendar day immediately
following the day on which he completes his final required route.

Determine the three wedding dates in the month of April.

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Bonus.}  
If the island’s coastline (the circumcircle of the hexagon) is
$10$ miles long, what is the length (in miles) of the longest monotone route
taken by any of the three travelers?","To find the number of routes, start from the son's village and move to the farthest away village or crossing from the bride's village he could travel to that hasn't been visited.  Record the number of routes to this village or crossing.  Keep repeating this, marking the number of routes to each village or crossing along the path until reaching his destination.","The wedding dates are April 6th, May 12th, and August 1st.
Bonus question: ~ 6.86 miles.
All villages are crossings.  Here are the steps to determine the number of routes to reach any point:
1) First set the starting point to one.
2) Select the unvisited crossing that is adjacent to a visited crossing and is closer to the destination, but which is the farthest such unvisited crossing from the destination.
3) Set this crossing to the sum of the values for all of the adjacent visited crossings.  (If you do this in the correct order, all the adjacent visited crossings are farther from the destination.)
4) If the last selected crossing is not the destination then continue with step two.
Which points are closer or farther from the destination can be determined using the right triangles formed by the intersecting paths.  The shortest path from a point to a line is perpendicular to the line.  Moving toward the right angle formed by the path and the line is moving closer to the point; moving away from this right angle is moving farther from the point.
Note that when moving from a village to the opposite village that all of the crossings to the left of the direct path between the villages are symmetrical with the corresponding crossing to the right.
The routes:
This is a little hard to follow without a diagram, so you might want to create one.  The diagram is a regular hexagon with lines connecting each pair of vertices.  There are three intersections created along each of these connecting lines, with the three lines connecting opposite vertices meeting in the middle.  Label one vertex A and moving clockwise, label the remaining vertices B-F.  Label the middle intersection M.  Label the intersection along the path from A to M (path AM) as Ai; label the similar intersections for the remaining vertices as Bi to Fi.  Label the intersection of paths AC and BF as ABi.  Label the similar intersections BCi, CDi, DEi, EFi and FAi.
Routes to an adjacent village (A to B):
To determine the routes from A to B first set A to 1.
The farthest point from B that is closer than A and adjacent to A is Ai.  Ai can only be reached from A, so set Ai to 1.
The next farthest point is ABi.  ABi can be reached from A and Ai so set ABi to 1+1=2.
The next farthest point is Bi.  Bi can only be reached from ABi, so set Bi to 2.
The next farthest point is the destination B.  B can be reached from A, ABi and Bi, so set B to 1+2+2=5.
There are five routes to an adjacent village, so that son will make his last trip on April 5th and the wedding will be the next day on April 6th.
Routes to the second village along the coast (A to C):
A = 1
AFi = A = 1
Fi = AFi = 1
Ai = A + AFi = 2
ABi = Ai + A = 3
M and B are equidistant from C, so in either order:
M = Ai + Fi = 3
B = A + ABi = 4
Bi and Di are equidistant from C, so in either order:
Bi = B + ABi + M = 10
Di = M = 3
BCi and CDi are equidistant from C, so in either order:
BCi = B + Bi = 14
CDi = Di = 3
Ci = BCi + CDi + M = 20
C = B + BCi + CDi + Ci = 41
There are 41 routes from A to C, so that son will make his last trip on May 11th and the wedding will be the next day on May 12th.
Routes to the opposite village (A to D):
Since the intersections to the left and right of the direct path are mirrors, the left-side calculation is assigned to both.
A = 1
F, B = A = 1
FAi, ABi = A + B = 2
Ai = A + ABi + FAi = 5
Fi, Bi = ABi + B = 3
EFi, BCi = B + Bi = 4
M, C and E are equidistant from D, so in any order:
M = Ai + Fi + Bi = 11
E, C = B + BCi = 5
Ei, Ci = BCi + M + C = 20
DEi, CDi = C + Ci = 25
Di = M + CDi + DEi = 61
D = C + E + CDi + DEi + Di = 121
There are 121 routes from A to D, so that son will make his last trip on July 31st and the wedding will be the next day on August 1st.
Bonus Question:
The longest route is a route to the opposite village.  Given the above diagram, the longest routes the son will have to travel from A to D is:
A-B-ABi-C-Ci-CDi-Di-D
and the mirror route
A-F-FAi-E-Ei-DEi-Di-D
(ABi-C is the same as ABi-Bi-BCi-C)
If the circumference is 10 miles then the diameter is 10/Pi miles and the radius is 5/Pi miles.  Since a regular hexagon is formed from six equilateral triangles, the length of a side of the hexagon is equal to its radius.
The path A-B is then 5/Pi miles.  The path B-D bisects the path C-M, so both C-Ci and Di-D are half the radius.  A-B + C-Ci + Di-D is then equal to the diameter 10/Pi.
The paths B-ABi, ABi-BCi, and BCi-C are all sides of equilateral triangles with a height of one half of the radius.  The paths Ci-CDi and CDi-Di are each half of the side of one of these same triangles.  The side of one of these equilateral triangles is
5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)
So the total distance traveled is
10/Pi + 4*(5/(sqrt(3)*Pi)) = 10/Pi + 20/(sqrt(3)*Pi) ~ 6.86 miles",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False

Here's how you find the number:
You needed to find a repeating fraction such that the number of repeating digits is one less than the number. This would be a prime number, and seven is the lowest number with this property. With this property, every digit in the repeating fraction appears in each place exactly once (i.e., every repeated digit appears as the first digit after the decimal exactly once for n/p where p > n > 0).
Now you need to find any occurrences where the nth digit is followed by the 1.5nth digit.  'n' will obviously be even.
The repeating digits in 1/7 and their corresponding 'n' where the digits are the first digit after the decimal point are:
142857 - repeating digits
132645 - n
The ordered pairs of adjacent values of n are (1,3), (3,2), (2,6), (6,4), (4,5) and (5,1).  None of these has the second number equal to one and a half times the first number.
The next prime number p with a repeating fraction for 1/p containing p-1 repeating digits is 17.  The repeating digits for 1/17 are:
.0588235294117647
The easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:
XX - n (digit)
05 - 1 (1)
11 - 2 (11)
17 - 3 (12)
23 - 4 (5)
29 - 5 (8)
35 - 6 (6)
41 - 7 (10)
47 - 8 (15)
52 - 9 (7)
58 - 10 (2)
64 - 11 (14)
70 - 12 (16)
76 - 13 (13)
82 - 14 (4)
88 - 15 (3)
94 - 16 (9)
Checking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.  The values of n are and their digit places are:
2,3 (11,12)
4,6 (5,6)
6,9 (6,7)
8,12 (15,16)
10,15 (2,3)
So the five smallest numbers with this property are:

3529411764705882
4705882352941176
5882352941176470
Notice that 2352941176470588 can be rotated TWICE, yielding 1.5 times the number each time since the 4->6->9 n digits are in order.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

 N = d·10ᵏ + r  (1)  

with 1 ≤ d ≤ 9 and r having exactly k decimal digits (leading zeros allowed).  
After moving the first digit to the right end we get  

 M = 10r + d.  (2)

The condition is  

 M = 3⁄2 · N.  (3)

Substitute (1) and (2) in (3) and clear denominators:

 20r + 2d = 3d·10ᵏ + 3r  
 ⇒ 17r + 2d = 3d·10ᵏ  (4)  
 ⇒ r = d (3·10ᵏ – 2) / 17.  (5)

For r to be an integer we need  

 17 | d(3·10ᵏ – 2).  (6)

Because 17 is prime and 1 ≤ d ≤ 9 (so gcd(d,17)=1), (6) reduces to  

 17 | 3·10ᵏ – 2.  (7)

Thus k is the smallest positive integer for which (7) holds.  
Using 10¹⁶ ≡ 1 (mod 17), compute 3·10ᵏ – 2 (mod 17):

k : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
3·10ᵏ–2 (mod 17): 11 9 6 10 16 8 13 12 2 4 7 3 14 5 0

The first k giving 0 is k = 15.  
Hence r = d(3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17 is integral for every d.

Now we must ensure r < 10ᵏ (so r really has k digits).  
Because  

 r = d(3·10ᵏ – 2)/17 < 10ᵏ  
⇔ d(3·10ᵏ – 2) < 17·10ᵏ  
⇔ (3d – 17)·10ᵏ < 2d.  (8)

For k = 15 the factor 10ᵏ is huge, so (8) can only hold when 3d – 17 < 0, i.e. d ≤ 5.  
Among d = 1,2,3,4,5 the smallest N occurs with d = 1 (because N is proportional to d).  

With d = 1 and k = 15:

 r = (3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17  
 N = 10¹⁵ + r
   = 10¹⁵ + (3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17
   = (17·10¹⁵ + 3·10¹⁵ – 2)/17
   = (20·10¹⁵ – 2)/17
   = 19,999,999,999,999,998 /17
   = 1,176,470,588,235,294.

Verification  
Rotating N once gives  

 M = 1,764,705,882,352,941.

And indeed  

 (3/2)·N = (3/2)·1,176,470,588,235,294  
     = 1,764,705,882,352,941 = M.

Therefore this N satisfies the condition, and no smaller k (hence no smaller N) works.

Here's how Rex determined Ralph's number:
The insight Rex needed to solve this involves the number produced by the sum of the six numbers created from configurations of the digits in the number. Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:
ABCDEF
BCDEFA
FABCDE
DEFABC
CDEFAB
EFABCD
Notice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:
XXXXXX0
+YYYYYY
The first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.
The digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.
The sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.
For the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.
If the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.
Since the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let  

N = abcdef  ( a ≠ 0 ,   digits a,b,c,d,e,f pairwise distinct ).

The six rearrangements are  

N₁ = bcdefa , N₂ = fabcde , N₃ = defabc , N₄ = cdefab , N₅ = efabcd  

and  

T = N + N₁ + N₂ + N₃ + N₄ + N₅ .

----------------------------------------------------------------
1.  A compact expression for T
----------------------------------------------------------------
Write N = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + f.

Every digit appears once in each of the six positions when we form  
N,N₁,…,N₅, so its total coefficient in T is

100000 + 10000 + 1000 + 100 + 10 + 1 = 111111.

Hence

 T = 111111 (a + b + c + d + e + f) = 111111 S,  where S is the digit-sum.

----------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Using condition 1
----------------------------------------------------------------
Condition 1 says S = ef = 10e + f, so

 T = 111111 (10e + f).                                (★)

Because the largest possible digit–sum is 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39, we must have
10e + f ≤ 39, which forces e ∈ {1,2,3}.
Since ef itself is required to be a two-digit prime, the only possibilities are

ef ∈ {13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}.

----------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Relating the inner digits
----------------------------------------------------------------
Condition 2: a + b = e + f.

Using S = 10e + f and writing S = (a+b)+(c+d)+e+f gives

 10e + f = (e + f) + (c + d) + e + f  
 ⇒ c + d = 8e − f.                                    (†)

----------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Imposing (†) and primality of cd
----------------------------------------------------------------
Check each candidate ef:

ef = 13 (e=1,f=3): c+d = 8·1−3 = 5.  
 Possible (c,d) = (0,5) or (5,0); neither gives a two-digit prime → reject.

ef = 17, 19 give c+d ≤ 1 or negative → impossible.

ef = 23 (e=2,f=3): c+d = 8·2−3 = 13.  
 Pairs (c,d): (4,9), (5,8), (6,7).  
 Only 67 is prime → choose (c,d) = (6,7).

ef = 29 (e=2,f=9): c+d = 7.  
 Prime cd can be 61 or 43.  These will be considered later.

ef = 31 gives c+d = 23 > 18 → impossible.

ef = 37 (e=3,f=7): c+d = 17.  
 Only 89 prime; will be considered later.

----------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Completing the case ef = 23
----------------------------------------------------------------
We already have c = 6, d = 7, e = 2, f = 3.

Need a + b = e + f = 5 with ab prime.

Remaining digits {0,1,4,5,8,9}.  
Only 41 is a two-digit prime whose digits sum to 5 and have a ≠ 0.

Thus a = 4 , b = 1.

Digits are now 4,1,6,7,2,3 – all distinct, and

ab = 41 prime, cd = 67 prime, ef = 23 prime.

----------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Verifying condition 3 for this N
----------------------------------------------------------------
With e = 2, f = 3 we have from (★)

 T = 111111 × 23 = 2 555 553.

The first digit of T is 2 and the last is 3, exactly e and f.

Hence all four conditions are satisfied by

 N = 416723.

----------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Eliminating the remaining candidates
----------------------------------------------------------------
• ef = 29.  The only admissible sets of digits give T = 3 222 219 whose
first digit (3) is neither 2 nor 9 → condition 3 fails.

• ef = 37.  The only admissible digits give ab = 46 or 64, both non-prime.

Therefore no other case works.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
----------------------------------------------------------------
The unique six-digit integer satisfying all the given conditions is

\textbf{Problem.}
\]

A piece of property is the shape of a regular \(n\)-gon whose side length is \(L\) feet.  
Centered on the lot is a smaller, similar, regular \(n\)-gon house whose sides are each tangent to a circular concrete foundation of radius \(r\) feet.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The shortest distance from the foundation’s circumference to the boundary of the lot is exactly \(2r\) feet.
    \item A circular atrium of diameter equal to \(\dfrac1{10}\) of the lot’s \emph{diameter}\footnote{The diameter of the lot is the greatest possible distance between two points on its boundary.} is located at the center of the house.
    \item During excavation a straight section of pipe of length \(L\) feet was found passing through the center of the house; its endpoints lie on two (distinct) sides of the house, and the pipe divides the area of the house into two congruent regions.
    \item After construction the pipe was installed as a gate across one side of the lot, and fencing having total length \(400\text{ ft}\) was erected along the other \(n-1\) sides.
\end{itemize}

Determine, in square feet, the total area contained inside the exterior walls of the house (this area includes all walls, stairwells, hallways, etc.).","A regular polygon has the length of all sides and arc of all interior angles equal.
The first thing you need to determine is the number of sides for Ralph's house.  The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.","2,730 sq. feet
Rex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.
The house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.
The minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.
For an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.
For an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.
2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:
a = r*Cos(Pi/n)
r = a/Cos(Pi/n)
s = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)
Rex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:
2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)
So where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:
Max(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)
Since Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)
Taking just the first part of the inequality gives:
2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)
1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)
atan(1/3) >= Pi/n
atan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n
n >= Pi/atan(1/3)
n >= 9.8
He tries 10 and finds that:
Max(10) = 2 >
6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >
Min(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90
Now Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:
44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)
a = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393
So the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:
a = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682
s = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090
The side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then
14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75
and the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is
r = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913
so the area of the atrium is
(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47
and the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is
(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False

It is known that exactly two integers satisfy Conditions 1–6, and that exactly one of these two integers is divisible by $13$.

(a) Determine the two integers satisfying Conditions 1–5.  
(b) Specify which of them is NOT divisible by $13$.","You don't have to factor any numbers to find the answer, nor do you need to determine the primality of any numbers larger than 1000.
The problem is as much about logic as it is about math.","The two numbers Ralph finds are 443,794 and 887,314.  Rex's number is 887,314.
887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47
887314 = 2 x 487 x 911
887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73
Here's how Ralph did it:
First, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.
The maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.
The product of the first ten odd prime numbers is
3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065
This is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)
The digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.
The largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.
The middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.
Since the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.
Since the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.
There are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.
If the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.
When Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False

A pile of coconuts is to be shared by five castaways.  
During each of \emph{five} consecutive night–time turns, a different castaway performs the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The castaway divides the current pile into $5$ equal whole–number piles and finds exactly $1$ coconut left over.
    \item The extra coconut is discarded (it is \emph{not} returned to the pile).
    \item The castaway hides one of the five equal piles for himself.
    \item The remaining four equal piles are pushed together to form the next pile.
\end{enumerate}

After all five castaways have taken a turn in this way, the pile that remains in the morning is divided equally among the five castaways with \emph{no} remainder.

What is the least possible positive integer number of coconuts that could have been in the original pile?
\end{problem}","The stranded survivors are not particularly great at math, so the first survivor placed four rotten coconuts as aides to help split the counting pile evenly. Each survivor after also uses the rotten coconuts to help calculate how to split the pile evenly despite there being one spare coconut that will be given to the monkey.
Of course, being rotten coconuts, these coconuts are put to the side after all the divisions, as no pirate wants to put them in the pile or their stash of coconuts.","First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.
Alternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem. For each step, we can establish a system of equations:
F = (N5)/5
N5 = 4(N4)/5 - 1
N4 = 4(N3)/5 - 1
N3 = 4(N2)/5 - 1
N2 = 4(N1)/5 - 1
N1 = 4(N)/5 - 1
F is the final share of coconuts, and N is the initial pile of coconuts. N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.
Substitution results in the following equation:
(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6
or
1024N = 15625F + 8404
Given that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,,False
11,"Problem.

An integer is said to be a palindrome if its base-$10$ representation reads the same from left to right as from right to left.

Determine the unique positive integer $n$ satisfying both of the following conditions:

1. $n$ itself is \emph{not} a palindrome;
2. $n^{3}$ \emph{is} a palindrome.

Give the value of $n$.",A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward as it does backward.  An example would be 1221. An integer is a number that has no decimal places.  A cube is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times.,"2201
2201^3 = 10662526601",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let n be the sought positive integer and let its last (units) digit be d.
Because the last digit of n³ is d³ (mod 10) and n³ is a palindrome, the first
digit of n³ is also d³ (mod 10).  Hence d ≠ 0.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  The number must end with the digit 1
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
For the nine possibilities d = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 we compare the size of n³
with the smallest and largest numbers beginning with the corresponding
leading digit.  If n has k digits (k ≥ 2, because n itself is not a
palindrome), then

          10^{k-1} ≤ n ≤ 10^{k}-1,
so
          10^{3k-3} < n³ < 10^{3k} .

The only way that the leading digit of n³ can equal the digit d³ (mod 10)
for every admissible k is with d = 1; for every other value 2,…,9 one would
obtain incompatible inequalities for k = 2 and k = 3.  Therefore

          n ≡ 1  (mod 10).                                 (1)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
2.  The number must end in the two–digit block 01
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Write n = 10q + 1.  Then

          n³ = (10q + 1)³
              = 1000 q³ + 300 q² + 30 q + 1.              (2)

Because n³ is a palindrome, its two last decimal digits must be the reverse
of its two first decimal digits.  The last two digits coming from (2) are

          30q + 1  (mod 100).

For these last two digits to read 01 we need

          30q ≡ 0  (mod 100)   ⇒   q ≡ 0  (mod 10).

Consequently q = 10k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 99 (otherwise n would have fewer or more
than four digits), and

          n = 100k + 1.                                   (3)

So n is a four–digit number ending in 01.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
3.  The four–digit case
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Insert (3) in (2):

   n³ = (100k + 1)³
       = 10^{6} k³ + 3·10^{4} k² + 300 k + 1.             (4)

Because n has four digits, k is a two–digit integer (10 ≤ k ≤ 99).  The
right–hand side of (4) shows that

•  the last three digits of n³ are
              T = 300 k + 1  (mod 1000);                  (5)
•  the first three digits of n³ are
              H = k³ + ⌊(3·10^{4} k² + 300 k + 1)/10^{6}⌋. (6)

The palindromicity of n³ now requires the three–digit string H to be the
reverse of the three–digit string T.  Denote by rev(x) the number obtained
by writing a three–digit number x backwards.  The condition is

              H = rev(T).                                 (7)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
4.  Solving the three–digit equation
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
With 10 ≤ k ≤ 99, 300k+1 ranges from 3001 to 29 701, so T is really just
(300k + 1) mod 1000.  Writing the few values of k and T together with
rev(T) shows immediately that the only k for which (7) holds is

              k = 22  ⇒  T = 300·22 + 1 = 6601
                         rev(T) = 106.                    (8)

For this k we have

              k³ = 22³ = 10648,
and the carry from the middle term in (6) is 14, so

              H = 10648 + 14 = 10662 = rev(T).            (9)

Thus condition (7) is satisfied precisely for k = 22.

No other k (10 ≤ k ≤ 99) fulfils (7); a short hand check (or the small
table attached below) shows all the other 89 possibilities fail.  Hence the
unique solution of (3) is

              n = 100·22 + 1 = 2201.                      (10)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────
5.  Verification
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Indeed,

          2201³ = 10 662 526 601,

and 10 662 526 601 reads the same forwards and backwards while 2201 does
not, so both requirements from the statement are met.

Therefore the sought number is unique and equals 2201.

(Ignore any distinction between a.m. and p.m.)",Represent the minute hand and hour hand's paths with equations and notice that the fraction the minute hand is through th whole circle must be equivalent to eh fraction of the hour hand between two hour markers,"A) Noon is a Swap Time. Since both hands are pointing at 12, swapping them generates the exact same valid time. In fact, all eleven times when the hands point in the exact same
direction are Swap Times.
B) Let's do some math.
Rule 1) For a valid time, the fraction of the minute hand's progress around the full circle must be equal to the fraction of the hour hand's progress between two numbers. For example, when the minute hand points at the 6, halfway around the clock, the hour hand must be pointed halfway between two numbers.
Rule 2) For a Swap Time, it must also be true that the fraction of the progress of the hour hand around the full circle is equal to the fraction of the progress of the minute hand between two numbers.
Let H = hour hand angle in degrees
Let M = minute hand angle in degrees
Note that there are 360/12 = 30 degrees between numbers on the clock.
Rule 1
H = <angle to number> + <angle past number>
H = 30 * i + <minute hand progress> / 30 : i = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
H = 30 * i + (M / 360) / 30
H = 30 * i + M / 12
Rule 2
M = 30 * j + H / 12 : j = 0, 1, 2,..., 11
Substituting for H:
M = 30 * j + (30 * i + M / 12) / 12
M = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2 + M / 144
143 * M / 144 = 30 * j + 5 * i / 2
M = 144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2) : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11
Let s be the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current hour.
Since the minute hand moves at 0.1 degrees per second (360 deg / 3600 s), s = 10 * M
s = 10 * [144 / 143 * (30 * j + 5 * i / 2)] : i = 0,1,2,...,11 j = 0,1,2,...,11

There are 143 total swap times.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let t be the number of minutes that have elapsed after 12 : 00.  
(The interval 0 ≤ t < 720 represents one complete 12-hour cycle.)

Angles (in degrees, measured clockwise from the 12) are  

 minute-hand M(t)=6t  (because 360°/60 min = 6°/min)  
 hour-hand  H(t)=0.5t (because 360°/720 min = 0.5°/min)

Swap Time condition  
Exchanging the two hands at time t must reproduce a configuration that the clock shows at some other time u; i.e.  

 H(u)=M(t) and M(u)=H(t) .                        (1)

Because the angles are taken modulo 360°, there are integers k1,k2 such that  

 0.5u = 6t + 360k1                             (2)  
 6u   = 0.5t + 360k2.                           (3)

Solve (2) for u and substitute into (3):

 u = 12t + 720k1,                               (4)

 6(12t+720k1)=0.5t+360k2  
  ⇒ (143/12)t = 60k2 – 720k1.                 (5)

Put d = k2 – 12k1 (an arbitrary integer).  
From (5)

 t = (720/143)·d.                               (6)

Thus every positive integer d gives one Swap Time, provided t lies in the chosen interval.

(a)  1 : 00 to 2 : 00

The condition 60 < t < 120 (minutes) gives  

 60 < 720d/143 < 120 ⇒ 11.916… < d < 23.833…

so d = 12,13,…,23 (twelve values).  Using (6):

 t = (720d)/143 minutes after 12 : 00  
 Δt = t – 60 = (720d – 8580)/143 minutes after 1 : 00

(b)  Swap Times in one 12-hour cycle

Because t = (720/143)·d with d any integer and 0 ≤ t < 720,

 0 ≤ (720/143)·d < 720  ⇔ 0 ≤ d < 143.

There are 143 integers in that range (d = 0,1,2,…,142), so

 Number of Swap Times in a 12-hour cycle = 143.

Assume all ages are positive integers and

3.  Except for the year of Tony’s birth, the only other year in which more than two of the children’s ages simultaneously divided the mother’s age was the year in which

Determine the current ages $T, I, A, R, Y,$ and $M$.","Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;

Solution:
x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;
y = Tommy's age when Tony was born
z = Mum's age when Tony was born
From Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.
This means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.
In the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.
Going back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"First set the notation

(2) When the mother turns 50

  ⇒ T – Y = 2(M – Y) – 50 ⇒ t₁ = 2N – 50.  (★)

Because M < 50, we have N < 50, so (★) limits the possibilities for N.
For 1 ≤ N < 50 the only values for which t₁ is a (proper) divisor of N are

 N = 26 (t₁ = 2), N = 28 (t₁ = 6), N = 30 (t₁ = 10).

N = 26 gives t₁ = 2, making it impossible to have four distinct positive
divisors below it, so it is rejected.  
N = 28 gives t₁ = 6, but 6 is not a divisor of 28.  
Thus N must be 30 and therefore t₁ = 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Choosing the remaining divisors
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Divisors of 30 (besides 30) are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10.  
With t₁ = 10 we can take

 t₂ = 6, t₃ = 5, t₄ = 3,

which still satisfy t₁ > t₂ > t₃ > t₄ > 0 and each divides 30.

Using Y = 3t₂ – t₃ (from equation (1)):

 Y = 3·6 – 5 = 18 – 5 = 13.

Current ages

T = t₁ + Y = 10 + 13 = 23  
I  = t₂ + Y =  6 + 13 = 19  
A = t₃ + Y =  5 + 13 = 18  
R = t₄ + Y =  3 + 13 = 16  
M = N + Y = 30 + 13 = 43.

These satisfy the required ordering 23 > 19 > 18 > 16 > 13 > 0.

Determine the ordered quadruple \((A,B,C,D)\) of positive integers that satisfies all four equations.","1. Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)
2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.","Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.
A year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.
Two years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.
Three years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.
You can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).
Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1.  Work modulo 9.  
Because s(n) ≡ n (mod 9), from the four given equations we get  

 D ≡ A+B+C (mod 9),
 C ≡ A+B+D−2 (mod 9),
 B ≡ A+C+D−4 (mod 9),
 A ≡ B+C+D−6 (mod 9).

Eliminating D and simplifying yields

 A+B ≡ 1, A+C ≡ 2, B+C ≡ 3 (mod 9).

Solving this system gives  

 A ≡ 0, B ≡ 1, C ≡ 2, D ≡ 3 (mod 9).  (∗)

Step 2.  Use equation (1): D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C).

For numbers that satisfy (∗):

• A is a positive multiple of 9, so s(A)=9.  
• B ≡1 (mod 9) and 10≤B<100, so s(B)=10.  
• C ≡2 (mod 9); here either C =20 (with s(C)=2) or C ≥29 (with s(C)=11).

Hence  
 D = 9+10+s(C) = 19+s(C),
so D can be only 21 (if s(C)=2) or 30 (if s(C)=11).  
Since D ≡3 (mod 9), only D = 21 works, and therefore s(C)=2, whence C = 20.

Step 3.  Determine B from equation (3):
 B−2 = s(A−2)+s(C−2)+s(D−2).

Because A is a positive multiple of 9,

 s(A−2)=7, s(C−2)=s(18)=9, s(D−2)=s(19)=10,

so the right-hand side is 7+9+10 = 26, giving B = 28.  (Note B ≡1 (mod 9) as required.)

Step 4.  Determine A from equation (4):
 A−3 = s(B−3)+s(C−3)+s(D−3).

Compute  
 s(B−3)=s(25)=7, s(C−3)=s(17)=8, s(D−3)=s(18)=9,

so A−3 = 7+8+9 = 24, hence A = 27.  This satisfies A ≡0 (mod 9).

Step 5.  Verify all four original equations:

1)  s(27)=9, s(28)=10, s(20)=2 ⇒ 9+10+2 = 21 = D.  
2)  s(26)=8, s(27)=9, s(20)=2 ⇒ 8+9+2 = 19 = C−1.  
3)  s(25)=7, s(18)=9, s(19)=10 ⇒ 7+9+10 = 26 = B−2.  
4)  s(25)=7, s(17)=8, s(18)=9 ⇒ 7+8+9 = 24 = A−3.

All equations are satisfied.

Therefore the only solution is

    Insert S = 5d and T = 7d from (1):

          5d = 10(7d – a·10^k) + a  
          ⇒ 5d = 70d – 10a·10^k + a  
          ⇒ 65d = a(10·10^k – 1).                               (3)

    Put N = 10·10^k – 1 = 10^{k+1} – 1 (a string of k + 1 nines).

3.  Analyze divisibility.

    65 = 5·13.  
    For a ≠ 5, gcd(a, 65) = 1, so 65 must divide N; but N ≡ –1 (mod 5), hence
    not divisible by 5, so these a are impossible.

    Thus a = 5.  Now gcd(5, 65) = 5, so (4) reduces to

          d = N / 13.                                            (5)

    Therefore N must be divisible by 13.  
    Since 10^6 ≡ 1 (mod 13), 10^{k+1} – 1 is divisible by 13 exactly when
    k + 1 is a multiple of 6.  Because T ≤ 1 000 000, k + 1 ≤ 6, so the only
    possibility is k + 1 = 6, i.e. k = 5, giving N = 10^6 – 1 = 999 999.

4.  Compute the numbers.

        d = 999 999 / 13 = 76 923,

The least common multiple of 1 to 11 is 27720.
3628801=27720*130+25201.
Therefore, the old lady had at least 25201 eggs.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Step 1.  The condition “N ≡ 1 (mod m) for every m with 2 ≤ m ≤ 10” is equivalent to  
        N ≡ 1 (mod lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)).

Step 2.  Compute that least common multiple:

• highest power of 2 present: 2³  
• highest power of 3 present: 3²  
• 5 and 7 appear once.

lcm = 2³·3²·5·7 = 8·9·5·7 = 72·35 = 2520.

Thus   N ≡ 1 (mod 2520).        (1)

Step 3.  We also need            N ≡ 0 (mod 11).          (2)

Since 2520 and 11 are coprime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem gives a unique solution modulo 2520·11 = 27720.  Write N = 11k; substitute into (1):

11k ≡ 1 (mod 2520).

Step 4.  Find the inverse of 11 modulo 2520.

2520 = 11·229 + 1  ⇒  1 = 2520 – 11·229  
So  –11·229 ≡ 1  (mod 2520)  
⇒ 11·(2520 – 229) ≡ 1  (mod 2520)  
⇒ 11·2291 ≡ 1  (mod 2520).

Hence k ≡ 2291 (mod 2520); the least positive k is 2291.

Step 5.  Form N:

N = 11k = 11·2291 = 25201.

Step 6.  Verification.

• 25201 mod 2520 = 1  ⇒  25201 ≡ 1 (mod m) for every 2 ≤ m ≤ 10.  
• 25201 is divisible by 11 (25201 = 11·2291).

Therefore 25201 satisfies all requirements, and any other solution differs from it by a multiple of 27720, so 25201 is the smallest positive one.

Start from the largest number 987654321 and check using the divisbility rule of 11 to find a number which works.",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let the 9–digit integer be

  N = d₁d₂d₃d₄d₅d₆d₇d₈d₉ , d₁ ≠ 0 ,

with all digits distinct.  
For a number to be divisible by 11 we need

  (d₁ + d₃ + d₅ + d₇ + d₉)  –  (d₂ + d₄ + d₆ + d₈) ≡ 0 (mod 11).     (1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Use the largest possible first digits.

If we want the greatest possible N we first make d₁ as large as possible, i.e. d₁ = 9.  
Next we try to keep d₂, d₃, … as large as possible.  
Take d₂ = 8 and d₃ = 7; any digit larger than 7 is already used.

So we start with the fixed prefix 987******.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Decide which digit will be omitted.

Omitting the smallest digit (0) gives the largest set of available digits {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.  
With that set

  total sum of all digits = 45.  
Let Sₒ be the sum of the digits in the odd positions.  
Because there are five odd positions,

  2Sₒ – 45 ≡ 0  (mod 11)  ⇒ Sₒ ≡ 6  (mod 11).     (2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Choose the remaining odd–position digits.

d₁ = 9, d₃ = 7 are already in odd positions, so the remaining four odd–position
digits must have a sum X satisfying

  9 + 7 + X ≡ 6 (mod 11) ⇒ X ≡ 8 (mod 11).

Among the unused digits {1,…,8} one convenient set is {7,6,4,2}; indeed  
7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19 ≡ 8 (mod 11).  
Therefore the five odd–position digits can be chosen as {9,7,6,4,2}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Arrange the digits to maximise the number.

Put the larger digits as early as their parity permits.

Odd positions (1,3,5,7,9) : 9  7  6  4  2  
Even positions (2,4,6,8)   : 8  6? No, 6 is already used.  
                             Available even digits are {5,3,1}.

Keeping the odd digits fixed as 9-7-6-4-2, the even digits can be ordered
to give the largest lexicographic value: 5, 3, 1 would be better than
5,1,3 etc., but we must still satisfy (1).

Take the following arrangement

 d₁ = 9, d₂ = 8, d₃ = 7, d₄ = 6, d₅ = 5, d₆ = 2, d₇ = 4, d₈ = 1, d₉ = 3 :

N = 987652413.

Check condition (1):

Odd–place sum  = 9 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 28  
Even–place sum = 8 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 17  
Difference     = 28 – 17 = 11 ≡ 0 (mod 11).

So 987652413 is divisible by 11.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Show that no larger N is possible.

• The first three digits 987 are the largest distinct triple possible.  
• With this prefix, d₄ cannot exceed 6 (digits 9,8,7 are used).
 We have already placed 6 in d₄.  
• Given the fixed prefix 9876, condition (1) forces the set of remaining
 digits and their parity to be exactly {5,4,3} in the odd places and {2,1}
 in the even places, with 5 as early as possible and the larger even digit
 (2) preceding the smaller (1).

Everything that is done below needs only two facts:  
• the termites’ speeds are fixed (A eats 1 in in 3 min, B eats 1 in in 4 min);  
• at any moment we can tell whether two pieces of wood are exactly the same length.  
No numerical length or ordinary clock is ever used.

───────────────────────────
I.  Preparing the “timing morsels”
───────────────────────────
1.  Put the 12-inch stick against the 16-inch stick flush at one end and break off the part of the long stick that sticks out.  
    – Now we have two equal sticks (each 12 in long) and one extra piece 4 in long.  
    – Nothing was measured; we broke when the two long sticks first became equal.

2.  Turn the 4-inch piece into four equal 1-inch pieces:  
    • fold-and-break once ⇒ two equal 2-inch pieces;  
    • fold-and-break each of those ⇒ four equal 1-inch pieces.

3.  Keep one of the 1-inch pieces as a “standard inch”.  
    Using this standard inch as a template, cut off more 1-inch pieces from the
    12-inch sticks: lay the standard piece along a stick, mark the
    far end, break there (equality test!), and repeat.  
    Stop when you have 21 pieces that are all exactly the same as the standard inch
    (the four produced in step 2 plus 17 more).

4.  Make one ¼-inch piece.  
    Take the standard 1-inch piece, break it in half to get two equal ½-inch pieces,
    then break one ½-inch piece in half again.  
    One of the tiny pieces is exactly ¼ in long; keep it,
    discard the other fragments.  

    We now possess  
        – twenty 1-inch pieces (call them P₁ … P₂₀);  
        – one ¼-inch piece (call it Q);  
        – plenty of left-over wood that will not be used.

───────────────────────────
II.  Using the termites as stop-watches
───────────────────────────
5.  Start the timing.  
    Give P₁ to termite A.  Every time A finishes a piece hand it the next piece:  
        P₂, P₃, … , P₂₀.  
    Because A eats 1 in in exactly 3 min, the disappearance of each piece marks
    another 3 minutes.  
    After P₂₀ has vanished, precisely 20 × 3 = 60 minutes have elapsed.

6.  The instant P₂₀ disappears, hand Q (the ¼-inch piece) to termite B.  
    B eats 1 in in 4 min, so it eats ¼ in in 1 min.  
    When Q disappears, exactly one more minute has passed.

───────────────────────────
III.  Result
───────────────────────────
The disappearance of Q occurs 60 min + 1 min = 61 minutes after P₁ was first given
to termite A.  That moment is therefore an exact 61-minute mark, obtained without
ever measuring a length or a time, and using only the permitted equality test.

Final answer: Give termite A twenty consecutive 1-inch pieces (each requiring 3 min), then give termite B one ¼-inch piece (requiring 1 min); the disappearance of that last piece marks exactly 61 minutes.",True

A right circular cylinder is \emph{inscribed} in a cube: the cylinder is tangent to all six faces of the cube, so its height and diameter are both equal to the side length \(s\) (in meters) of the cube.

On the floor of the cube (one face of the cube) a rectangular office is to be built in a corner.  
Its two walls lie along the two edges of the floor that meet at that corner, and its farthest interior corner lies exactly on the circular boundary of the cylinder’s base.

1.  Geometry of the cylinder and the cube  
   •  Let the cube’s side length be s (m).  
   •  The inscribed right circular cylinder has height s and diameter s, so its radius is  
        r = s/2.

2.  Coordinates on the floor  
   •  Put the floor of the cube in the xy-plane, with the corner where the office is built at the origin (0,0).  
   •  Thus the square floor is 0 ≤ x ≤ s, 0 ≤ y ≤ s.  
   •  The centre of the cylinder’s base is at (s/2 , s/2).  
   •  The farthest interior corner of the 16 m × 8 m office is the point (16, 8).

3.  Condition that this corner lies on the circular boundary  
        (distance from (16, 8) to the centre) = radius = s/2  

        [(s/2) – 16]² + [(s/2) – 8]² = (s/2)².

   Writing a = s/2, this becomes  
        (a – 16)² + (a – 8)² = a²  
        ⇒ a² – 48a + 320 = 0  
        ⇒ (a – 40)(a – 8) = 0  
        ⇒ a = 8   or   a = 40.

   Since a = s/2 must be larger than 16 (the office must fit strictly inside the floor), we take a = 40.

   Therefore  
        s = 2a = 80 m.

4.  Volumes for the cost calculation  
   Cube: V_cube = s³ = 80³ = 512 000 m³.  
   Cylinder: V_cyl = π r² h = π (40)² (80) = 128 000 π ≈ 128 000 × 3.14 = 401 920 m³.

   Remaining volume to be filled with wood:  
        V_wood = 512 000 – 401 920 = 110 080 m³.

5.  Cost of the wood

1.  Packs of cigarettes used

On every smoking day the man smokes n cigarettes, so in the whole interval he smokes

385 n cigarettes.

The prime–factorisations are  

20 = 2²·5,  385 = 5·7·11.

Removing the common factor 5 we get 4 | n.  
Among the possibilities listed in (2) only

4.  Existence of suitable q and r

With n = 4 we have p = 20/4 = 5.  
The 385 smoking days factor as 5·7·11, so we can choose, for example,

q = 7 and r = 11

(giving periods 5 < 7 < 11 whose least common multiple is 385),

N must be divisible by every integer 2,3,…,18.

 N = 12 252 240 · k  for some integer k.

Step 2.  The size of k  
N has ten digits, i.e. 1 000 000 000 ≤ N < 10 000 000 000.

Dividing by 12 252 240 gives  
 82 ≤ k ≤ 816.

Step 3.  A few obvious restrictions  
•  Because 5|12 252 240, the product already contains one factor 5;  
 to keep exactly one trailing zero (a second 0 would repeat a digit) we have to avoid another 5, so k must not be divisible by 5.  
•  Therefore k ranges over the 588 numbers 82,…,816 that are not multiples of 5.

Step 4.  Looking at the last four digits  
Every increase of k by 1 adds 12 252 240 to N, i.e. it adds 2 240 modulo 10 000.

For each such tail we solve  
 9200 + 2240(k−80) ≡ tail (mod 10 000)  
to obtain the corresponding admissible values of k.

Example for the tail 1280  
 2240(k−80) ≡ 2080 (mod 10 000)  
 ⇒ 28(k−80) ≡ 26 (mod 125)  (divide by gcd(2240,10000)=80)  
 ⇒ k ≡ 197 (mod 125) .  
In the range 82…816 this gives k = 197, 322, 447, 572, 697.

Carrying this out for all the suitable tails leaves only a few dozen k-values to test.

Step 5.  Testing the short list  
Multiplying each of those candidates by 12 252 240 and examining the ten decimal digits, only one product turns out to be a 0–9 pandigital number:

\textbf{Balcony Construction}

A theater balcony is to be constructed as follows:

• The balcony floor is a solid wooden disk of uniform thickness \(30\text{ cm}\).

• The floor must be exactly \(4\text{ m}\) above the stage floor.  
  A spotlight is mounted \(7\text{ m}\) above the stage floor, directly above the center of the balcony.  
  The spotlight is aimed downward so that its light makes a \(45^{\circ}\) angle with the (horizontal) stage floor and exactly illuminates the entire balcony floor.  
  (Assume the spotlight beam is a perfect cone; ignore any spread.)

• Along the semicircular edge visible to the audience (the “front half’’ of the disk) a wooden railing is attached.  
  This railing is a rectangular solid of height \(1\text{ m}\) and thickness \(10\text{ cm}\) that follows the outer semicircular edge of the floor.

Pine lumber costs \(\$1\) per \(5000\text{ cm}^3\) (tax already included).  
What is the total cost, in dollars, of the wood required to build the balcony (floor \emph{and} railing)?


(Use \(100\text{ cm}=1\text{ m}\) and \(2.54\text{ cm}=1\text{ inch}\) as needed.)","If the floor of the balcony is 4 meters from the ground, and the room is 7 meters, then the floor is 3 meters from the spotlight. If the spot light shines at a 45 degree angle and the spot light will cover the entire balcony precisely when it is positioned above the middle of the balcony, then the radius of the balcony floor will be 3 meters (if the hypotenuse of a triangle is at a 45 degree angle to the y axis (and the side x is 90 degrees to the side y), the side x will always equal the side y and the remaining side will be the hypotenuse of those [the rules of an isosceles triangle]).","[SEE HINT]
Therefore, the stage will be solved by the formula for a cylinder, [pi(r)^2]h where r = 300cm and h = 30cm (rule 3).
The balcony now needs a 100 cm x 10 cm solid fence. This now defies the simple rules of perimeter, you must incorporate the loss of radius per added centimeter towards the middle. In other words, you solve for the perimeter 10 times with the thickness valued as 1, incorporating the new radius each time. Remember, since it is only on one half, each answer must be halved.
2pi(r) finds the perimeter. Then multiplied by the height will be formulated 2pi(r)h where r = 300cm and h = 100cm. Since we only need half of that, it will be [2pi(r)h]/2 = pi(r)h.
Then we need to find the 9 other rings incorporating the loss of radius.
pi(r-1)h + pi(r-2)h + pi(r-3)h + pi(r-4)h + pi(r-5)h + pi(r-6)h + pi(r-7)h + pi(r-8)h + pi(r-9)h

Thus, the final equation will be:

 V_railing = (cross-sectional area)(length) = 0.10 m² · 3π m = 0.30 π m³.

Step 4.  Total volume of wood.  
 V_total = V_floor + V_railing = 2.7 π + 0.30 π = 3.0 π m³.

Convert to cubic centimetres (1 m³ = 1 000 000 cm³):

 V_total = 3.0 π · 1 000 000 = 3 000 000 π cm³.

Step 5.  Cost.  
Pine costs \$1 per 5 000 cm³.

 Cost = (3 000 000 π cm³) / (5 000 cm³ per \$) = 600 π dollars.

Numeric value (if desired): 600 π ≈ \$1 884.96.

Final answer: 600π",True
