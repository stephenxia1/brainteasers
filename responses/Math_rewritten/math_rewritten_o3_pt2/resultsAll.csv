 k = 6 : 28 circles fit in radius 5.98 …<6; the 29th would

A right square pyramid has four congruent isosceles triangular lateral faces, and can be constructed by combining 1029 congruent blocks.
Planes parallel to the base are placed at heights
\[
1\ \text{ft},\;2\ \text{ft},\;\dots,\;(h-1)\ \text{ft}
\]
above the base, partitioning the pyramid into \(h\) horizontal slices, such that no plane intersects through the interior of any block.
Determine \(h\), the height of the pyramid in feet.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,basicprompt,"Let V be the volume of the whole pyramid and v the (common) volume of each block, so

 V = 1029 v.                                        (1)

Because the pyramid is right and its horizontal cross-sections are squares that shrink linearly with the height, the square at height t (0 ≤ t ≤ h) is similar to the base and has side length proportional to (h − t).  Hence the volume of the portion of the pyramid lying below height k (k an integer, 0 ≤ k ≤ h) is

 V·(k/h)³.                                      (2)

Consequently the slice between heights k − 1 and k (of thickness 1 ft) has volume

 V·[(k/h)³ − ((k − 1)/h)³]  
 = V·(k³ − (k − 1)³)/h³.               (3)

Because no horizontal plane cuts through the interior of any block, every slice must consist of a whole number of blocks.  
Let N_k be that number of blocks in the k-th slice; then, from (1) and (3),

 N_k = ( V·(k³ − (k − 1)³)/h³ ) / v  
    = 1029·(k³ − (k − 1)³)/h³.         (4)

The expression in (4) must be an integer for every k = 1,2,…,h.

1.  Look at k = 1.  Here k³ − (k − 1)³ = 1, so (4) gives

 N₁ = 1029 / h³ ∈ ℤ.

 Thus h³ | 1029.                               (5)

2.  Factor 1029:

 1029 = 3·7³.

   From (5), the prime–power exponents in h³ cannot exceed those in 1029.  Hence

 h³ divides 3·7³ ⇒ h may contain no factor 3 (because any 3 in h would
 give 3³ in h³), and its 7-power can be at most 7¹ (for 7² in h would give
 7⁶ in h³).  Therefore

 h = 1 or h = 7.                              (6)

3.  Height h = 1 ft would mean there are no interior horizontal planes at all, contradicting the intent of the set-up (and making the given condition vacuous).  Thus h > 1, so from (6) we must have

 h = 7.

4.  Verification.  Put h = 7 in (4):

 N_k = 1029·(k³ − (k − 1)³)/7³  
    = 3·(k³ − (k − 1)³)  
    = 3·(3k² − 3k + 1)  
    = 9k² − 9k + 3,                            (7)

which is an integer for every k = 1,…,7.  Moreover, summing (7) over k = 1 to 7 indeed gives 1029, so all 1029 blocks are accounted for without any plane cutting a block.

Hence the only possible height that satisfies all the requirements is 7 ft.

Now look at the sum of the three integers modulo 3.

The problem states that x + y + z = 2003.  But 2003 ÷ 3 leaves a remainder of 2, i.e.

Determine that ordered pair \((m,n)\).
 Hint: Use prime factorizations",Use prime factorizations,"34,227 and  36,070.
The only factors of 1234567890 are 2, 3, 3, 5, 3607 and 3803. Testing the various products of these factors reveals that 34,227 and 36,070 are the closest pair of numbers that produce 1234567890.",GPT-o3,combinedhintPrompt,"We begin by factoring the given product.

1234567890  
= 2 · 617283945  
= 2 · 5 · 123456789  
= 2 · 5 · 3² · 3607 · 3803           (well–known factorisation of 123 456 789).

Hence

1234567890 = 2¹ · 3² · 5¹ · 3607¹ · 3803¹.         (1)

To minimise n – m subject to m n = 1234567890 with m ≤ n, we want m and n as close as possible; i.e. m must be the largest divisor of (1) that does not exceed √S, where  
S = 1234567890.

1. Locate √S.

Because 35 136² = 1 234 538 496 and 35 137² = 1 234 608 769, we have

√S ≈ 35 136.4.                                      (2)

2. Hunt for a divisor of S close to √S.

The only large prime factors of S are 3607 and 3803.  
If m contained both, it would be at least 3607·3803 ≈ 1.37 × 10⁷, far above √S.  
Therefore m must contain exactly one of those primes, multiplied by some of the small factors 2, 3², 5.

• Using the factor 3607:

3607·9 = 32 463  (< √S)  
3607·10 = 36 070 (> √S)

Thus the best choice with 3607 and m ≤ √S is 32 463.

• Using the factor 3803:

3803·9  = 34 227 (< √S)  
3803·10 = 38 030 (> √S)

Here 34 227 is below √S and closer to (2) than 32 463 is.

Hence the largest divisor of S that does not exceed √S is

m = 3803·9 = 34 227.                               (3)

3. Determine n.

n = S / m  
  = (2 · 3² · 5 · 3607 · 3803) / (3² · 3803)  
  = 2 · 5 · 3607  
  = 10 · 3607  
  = 36 070.                                        (4)

4. Verify minimality of n – m.

For x ≤ √S, the function g(x) = S/x – x has derivative g′(x) = –S/x² – 1 < 0, so g decreases strictly as x increases.  
Hence, among all divisors ≤ √S, the largest one (34 227) gives the smallest possible value of n – m. No divisor can lie between 34 227 and √S, so (3)–(4) is the optimal pair.

Difference: n – m = 36 070 – 34 227 = 1 843.

Therefore the required ordered pair is

The number of rings to be fit in this vacancy, R, is determined from the formula
R < (n - 1)*pi

This formula is derived from the fact that the circumference of a polygon with R sides (made up by connecting all the nucleus of the rings in the donut area) is always smaller (actually is inscribed in) than the locus of the donut area. This locus is, of course, neither the donut's outer nor inner ring, but the one in between those two.

\textbf{Problem.}
\]
A right square pyramid has four congruent isosceles triangular lateral faces, and can be constructed by combining 1029 congruent blocks.
Planes parallel to the base are placed at heights
\[
1\ \text{ft},\;2\ \text{ft},\;\dots,\;(h-1)\ \text{ft}
\]
above the base, partitioning the pyramid into \(h\) horizontal slices, such that no plane intersects through the interior of any block.
Determine \(h\), the height of the pyramid in feet.",You might want to start at the top.,"It is 7 feet tall.
The top tier is also the peak. Suppose it is a single block and see how the numbers behave.
Its four triangular surfaces share edges with its square base; the length of each such edge we will call b. (Assuming this length is 1 foot will also work.) The peak is a smaller pyramid so its volume, v1 = ( b * b * 1 ) / 3. Because a second tier will not change any of the angles involved, new triangles will be similar to old and all changes in measurement of length will be proportional. A pyramid 2 tiers tall would have v2 = ( 2*b * 2*b * 2 ) / 3 = 8*v1. For 3 tiers, v3 = ( 3*b * 3*b * 3 ) / 3 = 27*v1. It becomes clear that a cube number must be a factor of the number of blocks.
1029 = 3 * 7^3, so there are 7 tiers. (The peak being formed by 3 separate blocks, every tier has 3 times as many blocks as in the supposition. Because 7 is a prime number, there is no smaller number of tiers which would satisfy the question.)",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let V be the volume of one block.  
Since 1029 congruent blocks form the whole pyramid, the volume of the pyramid is  

  VPyr = 1029 V. (1)

Assume the pyramid has integral height h (ft).  
Insert the horizontal planes at heights 1 ft, 2 ft, … , (h–1) ft above the base; these planes cut the pyramid into h slices, each 1 ft thick.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  Volume of the k-th slice  
-------------------------------------------------
Number the slices from the top:  
slice k is the region between heights h–k and h–k+1 (k = 1,2,…,h).

Because every horizontal cross–section of a right square pyramid is a square whose side length is proportional to the distance from the apex, at height z the side length equals

  s(z) = s₀ (h – z) / h ,  

where s₀ is the side length of the base.

Hence the cross-sectional area at height z is

  A(z) = s(z)² = s₀² (h – z)² / h².

The volume of slice k is therefore  

  Vk = ∫_{h−k}^{h−k+1} A(z) dz
    = (s₀² / h²) · 1⁄3 [ (h−k+1)³ − (h−k)³ ]          (2)

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Volume ratio of a slice to the whole pyramid  
-------------------------------------------------
The entire pyramid has volume  

  VPyr = (1/3) s₀² h.                                  (3)

Divide (2) by (3):

  Vk / VPyr = [ (h−k+1)³ − (h−k)³ ] / h³
       = (k³ − (k−1)³) / h³
       = (3k² − 3k + 1) / h³.                        (4)

-------------------------------------------------
3.  How many blocks lie in each slice?  
-------------------------------------------------
Since every block has volume V, the number bk of blocks in slice k is

  bk = Vk / V = (VPyr / V) · Vk / VPyr
     = 1029 · (3k² − 3k + 1) / h³.                    (5)

Because no plane cuts through the interior of any block, every bk must be an integer.  
In particular, for k = 1 we get

  b₁ = 1029 / h³ ∈ ℕ.                                  (6)

Thus h³ must divide 1029.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  Determining h from 1029  
-------------------------------------------------
Factor 1029:

  1029 = 3 · 7³.

The only perfect cubes that divide 1029 are 1³ and 7³ (= 343).  
Therefore

  h = 1   or   h = 7.                                  (7)

-------------------------------------------------
5.  Excluding h = 1  
-------------------------------------------------
The statement of the problem speaks of “planes at heights 1 ft, 2 ft, … , (h−1) ft”.  
If h = 1 there would be no such planes at all, contradicting the given construction.  
Hence h ≠ 1.

-------------------------------------------------
6.  Conclusion  
-------------------------------------------------
The only possible and admissible height is

  h = 7 ft.

All conditions are then met: from (5) with h = 7, each slice contains

  3, 21, 57, 111, 183, 273, 381   blocks,

all integers whose sum is 1029.

Let \(x<y<z\) be positive integers satisfying the following conditions:

1.  Each of \(x,\;y,\;z\) is a three–digit integer (its first digit is non–zero).  
2.  The base-\(10\) representations of \(x,\;y,\) and \(z\) are rearrangements of the same three digits; that is, \(y\) and \(z\) are obtained from \(x\) by permuting its digits.  
3.  The three integers are pairwise distinct.  
4.  Their sum is
   \[
   x+y+z = 2003.

Determine the ordered triple \((x,y,z)\).",You will need five numbers of three digits each.,127 + 172 + 271 + 712 + 721 = 2003,GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"Let the (possibly repeated) digits occurring in the three–digit integers be  
a , b , c (with a ≠ 0, because every number is a three–digit number).

For each of the three numbers  
x = 100·(hundreds digit) + 10·(tens digit) + (units digit)  
the remainder upon division by 3 equals the remainder of its digit–sum,
because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3).  Consequently

x ≡ (a + b + c) (mod 3)  
y ≡ (a + b + c) (mod 3)  
z ≡ (a + b + c) (mod 3).

Adding the three congruences gives

x + y + z ≡ 3(a + b + c) ≡ 0  (mod 3).             (1)

But the stated sum of the numbers is

x + y + z = 2003.

Because 2003 ÷ 3 leaves a remainder of 2, we have

2003 ≡ 2  (mod 3).                                        (2)

The congruences (1) and (2) are incompatible: the same integer cannot be
simultaneously congruent to 0 and to 2 modulo 3.

The only factors of 1234567890 are 2, 3, 3, 5, 3607 and 3803. Testing the various products of these factors reveals that 34,227 and 36,070 are the closest pair of numbers that produce 1234567890.",GPT-o3,mathPrompt,"First factor the number.

1234567890 = 10 · 123456789  
                   = 2 · 5 · 9 · 13717421  
                   = 2 · 5 · 3² · 3607 · 3803

Thus

1234567890 = 2 · 3² · 5 · 3607 · 3803 = 90 · 3607 · 3803.

Write its positive divisors as the product of two factors m ≤ n; we want the pair whose difference n – m is the least.

1.  The two primes 3607 and 3803 are both much larger than the remaining prime factors (which together make 90).  
    •  If both large primes were placed in the same factor, that factor would be at least 3607·3803 = 13 717 421, far exceeding √1234567890 ≈ 35 136, so the other factor would be at most 90 and the difference would exceed 13 717 331 – clearly not minimal.  
    •  Therefore in any optimal pair the primes 3607 and 3803 lie in different factors.

2.  Let the small factor 90 be split between the two sides.  
    Put s (a divisor of 90) with 3607 and the remaining 90/s with 3803:

        m₁ = 3607·s,     n₁ = 3803·(90/s)    (1 ≤ s ≤ 90, s | 90).

    Because only 2·3²·5 = 90 is being rearranged, every possible distribution of the small primes is represented by some divisor s of 90.

3.  Compute the twelve possibilities (divisors of 90):

   The smallest absolute difference is 1 843, occurring for s = 10.

4.  For s = 10 we found  
        3607·10 = 36 070, 3803·9 = 34 227.  
    To respect the condition m ≤ n we take

34 227 · 36 070 = (3803·9)(3607·10) = 3803·3607·90 = 1234567890,
