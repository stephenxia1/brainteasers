If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.

The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": null, "Status": false}

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": null, "Status": false}

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "solutionSummary", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.

If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

N1 corresponds to the pile after the first survivor was done taking their share, N2 corresponds to the pile after the second survivor was done taking their share, and so on and so forth.\nSubstitution results in the following equation:\n(4^5)N = (5^6)F + (4 * 5^5) - 4^6\nor\n1024N = 15625F + 8404\nGiven that N and F must be positive integers, this equation can be solved with brute force or modular arithmetic to yield 3121.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "hint_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "stepcounter", "Response": null, "Status": false}

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age).

This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "rewrite", "Response": null, "Status": false}

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "rewrite", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "rewrite", "Response": null, "Status": false}

When the mother turns $50$, Tony will be exactly as old as the mother was when Tommy was born:\n   \\[\n   50-\\bigl(M-Y\\bigr)=M-T .\n   \\]\n\nDetermine the current ages $T, I, A, R, Y,$ and $M$.", "Hint": "Set x = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born; there are only a limited number of possible values of y and z and on can perform casework", "Human Solution": "Tommy is 23, Timmy is 19, Tammy is 18, Tracey is 16, Tony is 13 and Mum is 43.\nSolution:\nx = Mum's age when she gave birth to Tommy = Tony's age when Mum turns 50;\ny = Tommy's age when Tony was born\nz = Mum's age when Tony was born\nFrom Tammy's last statement, 2x + y = 50 and it can be deduced that x = z - y, where y is a factor of z.  By combining the two equations you get 2z = 50 + y The only possible solutions for that equation so that y is also a factor of z are (z = 26, y = 2) and (z = 30, y = 10).  Only 30 has four or more factors, so Mum was 30 and Tommy was 10 when Tony was born.\nThis means that of the remaining factors of 30, Timmy was 6, 5 or 3, Tammy was 5, 3 or 2 and Tracey was 3, 2 or 1.  This makes Tammy 18, 15 or 9 now.  The only other time where the ages of more than two of the children were factors of Mum's age was when Tracey was half what Tammy is now, so Tammy must be 18 now.\nIn the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year, Tracey was therefore 9.  When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.  If Tammy is 18 now then Tony is 13, Tracey is 16, Timmy is 19, Tommy is 23 and Mum is 43.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "rewrite", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "rewrite", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "self_correction_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "explicit_symbol_reasoning_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division.

We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.

Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.

When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39.

There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y).

However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "implicit_symbol_reasoning_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "implicit_symbol_reasoning_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts.

When Tony was born, Tracey was either 3, 2 or 1, giving possible time differences of 6, 7 or 8 years, which correspond to Tony's age in the second multiple-factors-of-Mum's-age year.  It also means Mum was 36, 37 or 38 that year.  37 is prime and 38 has factors of 1, 2 and 19, and as Tony was at least 6, it means that Mum must have been 36 that year.\nGoing back to when Tony was born we have that Mum was 30, Tommy was 10, Timmy was 6, Tracey was 3, and as the middle child Tammy must have been 5.

Any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  (They have the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n2. Each daughter was between 17 and 33 at the time of her wedding.", "Human Solution": "Alice is 27, Barbara is 28, Cheryl is 20, and Denise is 21, 21 = 2+7+2+8+2+0.\nA year ago, they were 26, 27, 19, and 20, 19 = 2+6+2+7+2+0.\nTwo years ago, they were 25, 26, 18, and 19, 26 = 2+5+1+8+1+9.\nThree years ago, they were 24, 25, 17, and 18, 24 = 2+5+1+7+1+8.\nYou can solve this one by trial and error (particularly with the hint), but you can also use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9.  If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.  So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "implicit_symbol_reasoning_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

The repeating digits for 1/17 are:\n.0588235294117647\nThe easiest way to assign 'n' for each digit is to list all of the digit pairs in order:\nXX - n (digit)\n05 - 1 (1)\n11 - 2 (11)\n17 - 3 (12)\n23 - 4 (5)\n29 - 5 (8)\n35 - 6 (6)\n41 - 7 (10)\n47 - 8 (15)\n52 - 9 (7)\n58 - 10 (2)\n64 - 11 (14)\n70 - 12 (16)\n76 - 13 (13)\n82 - 14 (4)\n88 - 15 (3)\n94 - 16 (9)\nChecking the even-numbered values of n in the above table reveals that ALL even values of n less than 2/3 of 17 are followed by the 1.5n digit.

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits. So the first two digits are 41 and the last two digits are 23.\nSince the sum of all the digits is 23, then the sum of the middle two digits must be 23 - (2+3) - (4+1) = 13. There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13. Sixty-seven is the only prime number that can be formed from these pairs, so the middle two digits are 67 and Ralph's number is 416723.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "nl_to_symbol_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "nl_to_symbol_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "nl_to_symbol_prompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.

From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "basicprompt", "Response": "I am sorry \u2013 I have not been able to find two integers that fulfil Conditions 1\u20135 and can therefore not answer parts (a) and (b).", "Status": true}

This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.\nFour of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.\nAfter the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.\nThis procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.\nThe rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts.\nAlternatively, we can set up a system of equations to solve the problem.

If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:\nd = a + b + c (mod 9)\nc-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)\nb-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)\na-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).\nSolving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9).  It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.   If you use the age restriction in the hint, you can omit some of the following analysis, but I present it here in full to show that the solution is truly unique even without the hint.\nIf we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9).  Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9.   We can rule out  such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99).  Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages.  So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.\nNow go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding.  Alice we now know was 25.  Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9.  Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago.  So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.\nNow consider Cheryl's wedding last year.  Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27.  Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11.  If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now.  But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister.

Equation (1) gives D = s(A)+s(B)+s(C) = 9 + s(B) + s(C).  \n   Thus the only feasible values for D are 12, 21 or 30.\n\n   \u2022 D = 12 forces s(B)=1 and s(C)=2; this makes equation (2) impossible.  \n   \u2022 D = 21 forces {s(B),s(C)} = {1,11} or {10,2}; both make equation (2) impossible.  \n   \u2022 Hence D = 30, and necessarily s(B)=10, s(C)=11.\n\n4.  So we must have B \u22611 (mod 9) with s(B)=10 (i.e. B = 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82) and  \n   C \u22612 (mod 9) with s(C)=11 (i.e. C = 29, 38, 47, 56, 65, 74, 83).\n\n5.  Equation (2):\u2003C\u22121 = s(A\u22121)+s(B\u22121)+s(29) = s(A\u22121)+9+11.  \n   This forces C = 29 and s(A\u22121)=8.  Any multiple of 9 from 9 to 81 satisfies s(A\u22121)=8.\n\n6.  Equation (3):\u2003B\u22122 = s(A\u22122)+9+10 = 26, so B = 28.\n\n7.  Equation (4):\u2003A\u22123 = 7+8+9 = 24, hence A = 27.\n\n8.  The quadruple (A,B,C,D) = (27,28,29,30) obeys all four original equations:\n   \u2022 30 = 9+10+11  \n   \u2022 28 = 8+9+11  \n   \u2022 26 = 7+9+10  \n   \u2022 24 = 7+8+9.\n\nTherefore the sisters\u2019 current ages on the day of Denise\u2019s wedding are 27, 28, 29 and 30.\n\nFinal answer: (27, 28, 29, 30)", "Status": true}

Assign ABCDEF to the digits in Ralph's number. The six numbers Ralph had Rex add together were:\nABCDEF\nBCDEFA\nFABCDE\nDEFABC\nCDEFAB\nEFABCD\nNotice that the six digits in each column in this summation are the six digits in the number. This means that the sum of each column will be the digital sum of the number. If that digital sum is represented by A+B+C+D+E+F = XY, then the problem is equivalent to adding:\nXXXXXX0\n+YYYYYY\nThe first and last digits will be X and Y only if 10 > X + Y. If X + Y is greater than 9, then the first digit will be X+1. Since both the digital sum of the number (A+B+C+D+E+F) and the first and last digit of the sum of the numbers match the digits XY, you know that 10 > X + Y. When Rex realized this relation he smiled because he knew that he had enough information now.\nThe digital sum of the number must be between 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15 and 9+8+7+6+5+4 = 39. Since each of the digit pairs in the number form a prime number, the digital sum must be a prime number in this range. There are only six prime numbers in this range: 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37. 19, 29 and 37 are eliminated since 1+9 > 9, 2+9 > 9 and 3+7 > 9.\nThe sum of the first two digits must match the sum of the last two digits (X+Y). For 31, 3+1=4, but the only other way to make four without repeating any digits is 0+4. Zero and four can't form a prime number, so the digital sum can't be 31. This leaves 17 and 23.\nFor the digital sum to be 17, the digits must be either 0+1+2+3+4+7 = 17 or 0+1+2+3+5+6 = 17. Only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 has both a 1 and 7 to make the last two digits be 17. However, there is no pair of remaining digits with a sum of 1+7 = 8, so the digital sum can't be 17 and therefore must be 23.\nIf the last two digits are 23, then the first two digits must total 2+3 = 5. The possibilities are 0+5 = 5 and 1+4 = 5. There is one prime number possible with each of these pairs: 05 and 41. The first two digits of the number can't be 05 because then the number would be a 5-digit number and Ralph's number has six digits.

There are two pairs of the remaining digits that total 13: 5+8 = 13, and 6+7 = 13.

The rest solves in a fairly straight-forward manner once this is determined.", "Human Solution": "2,730 sq. feet\nRex realized that he would need to know the number of sides on Ralph's house in order to make use of the only measurement Ralph gave him, which was the perimeter minus the length of one side for the property.  The length of a side of the property needed to be the length of the pipe that bisected the area of the house.  The length of the pipe is the key to figuring out how many sides the house has.\nThe house is a regular polygon inscribed in the circle that is the foundation.  Since the closest edge of the property is equal to the diameter of the foundation, then the property must be a similar polygon circumscribed around a circle with a diameter three times the size of the foundation.\nThe minimum and maximum length line segments that can bisect the area of a regular polygon are calculated differently for even- and odd-sided polygons.\nFor an even-sided polygon inscribed in a circle of radius r, the maximum line segment has its ends at two opposite vertices and the length is 2r. The minimum line segment goes from the middle of one edge to the middle of the opposite edge.  The distance from the edge to the center of a polygon is the apothem, so the minimum line segment is two times the apothem a.\nFor an odd-sided polygon the maximum bisector goes from a vertex to the middle of the opposite side, so the maximum is r + a. As with an even-sided polygon, the minimum bisector for an odd-sided polygon extends through the center of the polygon and at an angle halfway between two adjacent maximum bisectors.\n2Pi radians = 360 degrees.  The central angle between any two adjacent vertices on a polygon with n sides is then 2Pi/n and the angle between a vertex radius and the apothem is half that or Pi/n.  The apothem and the radius form two sides of a right triangle, with the third side formed by one half of the side bisected by the apothem.  For a regular polygon with n sides of length s this gives the following relationships:\na = r*Cos(Pi/n)\nr = a/Cos(Pi/n)\ns = 2*a*Tan(Pi/n)\nRex assigns one as the radius of the foundation.  This makes the apothem of the property three and the side of the property is:\n2*3*Tan(Pi/n) = 6*Tan(Pi/n)\nSo where Min(n) and Max(n) are the minimum and maximum length of a bisector for an n-sided polygon inscribed in a unit circle, Rex needs to find an integer value for n that satisfies the inequality:\nMax(n) >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= Min(n)\nSince Rex is pretty sure there's only one solution, he figures first he'll just use the minimum and maximum functions for even-sided polygons.  The minimum and maximum for odd-sided polygons will be within this range, so he might find an odd-sided polygon that doesn't satisfy the equation, but he won't miss any that do.  This gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n) >= 2*Cos(Pi/n)\nTaking just the first part of the inequality gives:\n2 >= 6*Tan(Pi/n)\n1/3 >= Tan(Pi/n)\natan(1/3) >= Pi/n\natan(1/3) / Pi >= 1/n\nn >= Pi/atan(1/3)\nn >= 9.8\nHe tries 10 and finds that:\nMax(10) = 2 >\n6*Tan(Pi/10) = 1.95 >\nMin(10) = Cos(Pi/10) = 1.90\nNow Rex knows that Ralph's house has ten sides and is a regular decagon.  That makes the length of the pipe and of a side of the larger decagon 400/9 = 44 4/9 = 44.444.. feet.  From the equation above:\n44.444 = 2*a*Tan(Pi/10)\na = 44.444 / Tan(Pi/10) ~ 68.393\nSo the radius of the larger circle is 68.393 feet and the radius of the foundation is 68.393/3 = 22.798, which is also the radius of the house decagon.  The apothem and length of a side for the house are:\na = 22.798 * Cos(Pi/10) = 21.682\ns = 2 * 21.682 * Tan(Pi/10) = 14.090\nThe side and apothem are the base and height of one of the ten triangles formed by two vertex radii and a side.  The area of one of these triangles is then\n14.090 * 21.682 / 2 = 152.75\nand the area of the decagon is 10 * 152.75 = 1527.5.  Now Rex just needs to know the size of the atrium to calculate the square footage of the house.  The radius of the atrium is one-tenth the radius of the large decagon, which is\nr = 68.393 / Cos(Pi/10) = 71.913\nso the area of the atrium is\n(71.913 / 10)^2 * Pi = 162.47\nand the area of the two floors in Ralph's house is\n(1527.5 - 162.47) * 2 = 2730.0 square feet.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": null, "Status": false}

Rex's number is 887,314.\n887313 = 3 x 7 x 29 x 31 x 47\n887314 = 2 x 487 x 911\n887315 = 5 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 73\nHere's how Ralph did it:\nFirst, since the three adjacent numbers don't share any prime numbers, the middle number must be even, otherwise both the other numbers would have to be divisible by 2.  If one of the factors in Rex's number is two, then the other two factors must add up to 1400 - 2 = 1398.\nThe maximum product of two numbers that add up to 1398 is 699 x 699, so the upper bound for Rex's number is 2 x 699 x 699 = 977,202.\nThe product of the first ten odd prime numbers is\n3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19 x 23 x 29 x 31 = 100,280,245,065\nThis is the minimum value for the product of Rex's number minus one times Rex's number plus one.  Therefore the square root of this number is the lower bound for Rex's number.  The square root of 100,280,245,065 ~ 316,670.  So now Ralph knows that Rex's number is an even number between 316,670 and 977,202.  He figures this could be found by brute force given the other clues.  (In fact, 887,314 is the only number in this range that is between two numbers with five or more unique prime factors, but Ralph doesn't know that.)\nThe digital sum of the prime factors of the number are prime numbers, one of which is 2.  The other two must be prime numbers between 316,670 / 1,398 ~ 227 and 1,398.  The maximum digital sum for numbers in this range is 3 x 9 = 27, so the maximum value for the product of the three prime digital sums is 2 x 23 x 23 = 1,058.  The digital sum of this number is also prime.  The maximum digital sum in this range is 27, so the digital sum of this product is a prime number less than 27.\nThe largest digital sum for a number in the range 316,670 to 977,202 is 6 x 9 = 54.  This means that the digital sum of the number must be a prime number less than 54 that is a different prime number less than 27 when reversed.  There are four prime numbers less than 54 that are a different prime number when reversed: 13, 17, 31 and 37.  The digital sum of Rex's number must be 31.\nThe middle two digits are prime.  For there to be a middle two digits, the number of digits in the number must be even.  So now the upper bound for the number is 977,202.  The number formed by the middle two digits must also be prime.  There are only four two-digit prime numbers composed of prime digits: 23, 37, 53 and 73.  The number formed by the first three digits is prime, so the third digit can't be 2 or 5.  The middle two digits must be either 37 or 73.\nSince the sum of the first three digits is a prime number, the sum must be one of 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 or 23.  Since the number must start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, the minimum value for the first three digits is 403, which eliminates 5 as a digital sum.  The digital sum of the digital sum of the first three digits must be prime, so it can't be 13, 17 or 19.  This leaves 7, 11 or 23 as the digital sum of the first three digits.\nSince the only possibility for the first three digits totaling 7 is 403, Ralph did a couple of quick calculations to determine that 403 = 13 x 31, so it isn't prime.  So the digital sum of the first three digits must be either 11 or 23 and the digital sum of the last three digits must be 20 or 8.\nThere are only four ways to make a digital sum of 11 for the first three digits that ends in a three or seven and starts with 4, 6, 8 or 9: 407, 443, 623 and 803.  Ralph does a couple more quick calculations and determines that 407 = 11 x 37, 623 = 7 x 89 and 803 = 11 x 73, but that 443 is prime.  If 443 are the first three digits, then the last three digits must total 20, start with a 7 and end with a 4, 6 or 8.  There is only three ways to do this: 758, 776 and 794.  The fifth digit can't be prime, so only 794 is possible.  This gives the first number 443,794.\nIf the first three digits total 23, start with a 4, 6, 8 or 9, and end with a 3 or 7, then the choices are 887 and 977.  The second digit in 977 is prime, so the only choice is 887.  Ralph checks and finds that 887 is prime.  If the first three numbers are 887 then the last three must start with a 3, end with a 4, 6 or 8 and total 8.  Only 314 is possible, giving the second number 887,314.\nWhen Rex tells Ralph one of the numbers is divisible by 13, Ralph finds that 443,794 = 13 x 34,138.  Since 13 can't be one of the prime factors of the number, the number must be 887,314.", "Model": "GPT-o3", "PromptType": "mathPrompt", "Response": "I am unable to complete the problem.", "Status": true}
