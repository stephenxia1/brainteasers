I will provide you with a problem and its solution. Without solving the problem yourself, I want you to divide the provided solution into steps, where a step is defined as something that does not need to be super fine-grained like “1 + 1 = 2” or “a -> b, b->c; a->c.” Instead, each step should represent a key component of the solution and the steps sequentially lead to the final answer to form a complete solution. Make sure to not omit any necessary information, and also make sure that your standard of what is considered a "step" is as consistent as possible. Count the total number of steps in the human solution and report each step and the total number of steps in the format “Total Step Count:” followed by the number of steps, and then “Steps:” with the steps needed.
