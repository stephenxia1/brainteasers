You are grading a student's exam. You will first be presented with the student's response, then with the solution. Respond only with one character, 1 if the student utilized a brute-force or guess-and-check method and 0 if they did not.

Definition of brute force: A brute force solution is a simple, comprehensive search strategy that systematically explores every option until a problem’s answer is discovered. It’s a generic approach to problem-solving that’s employed when the issue is small enough to make an in-depth investigation possible. However, because of their high temporal complexity, brute force techniques are inefficient for large-scale issues.
Common traits of brute force solutions include utilizing code, guess-and-check, or performing computations that a human would ordinarily not be able to do.

For example, take the following two problems:

PROBLEM 1:
"After being marooned on an island, a group of five people spent some time obtaining a lot of coconuts. After the five have decided that they have collected enough coconuts to last long enough for rescuers to arrive, they place all coconuts in a communal pile.
However, the first person suddenly had concerns about how the group would divide the coconuts the following day. In the dead of the night, the first survivor divided the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, gave one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hid their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mixed the four other piles to cover his tracks before going back to sleep.
The second survivor had the same exact train of thought, and proceeded to divide the pile into five equal piles of whole coconuts, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, hide their share of the coconuts (one-fifth of the pile), and mix back together the other four piles before going back to sleep.
In an ironic twist of fate, the other three survivors also had the same line of reasoning as the other two survivors and proceeded to do exactly the same thing (divide the pile, give one remaining coconut to a passing monkey, etc.). In a twist of fate, none of the survivors woke up to the other survivors taking their share from the pile.
When the group woke up in the morning, everyone could see that the pile was substantially reduced, but since every survivor took from the pile, no one said anything to incriminate themselves. Nonetheless, the survivors divided the reduced pile of coconuts into five equal shares of whole coconuts one last time, this time without any remaining coconuts to give to any monkeys.
What is the least number of whole coconuts the pile can have before the night?"

Here is an example solution for the above example problem that use brute-force:

EXAMPLE BRUTE-FORCE SOLUTION:

Beginning from 1 and counting upwards, we check each number and simulate the number of coconuts that remain at the end, and check if it is an integer.
After using code to simulate the distribution of coconuts, we see that 3121 is the smallest possible number of starting coconuts such that every condition is satisfied.

Here are two example solutions that do not use brute-force:

EXAMPLE NON-BRUTE-FORCE SOLUTION 1:

"First, we start with 5^5 coconuts. This is the smallest number that can be divided evenly into fifths, have a fifth removed and the process repeated five times, with no coconuts going to the monkey.
Four of the 5^5 coconuts are rotten and placed aside. When the remaining supply of coconuts is divided into fifths, there will of course be one non-rotten coconut left over to give to the monkey.
After the first person has taken his share, and the monkey has his coconut, we put the four rotten coconuts back with the others to make a pile of 5^4 coconuts. This can be evenly divided by 5. Before making this next division, however, we again put the four rotten coconuts aside so that the division will leave an extra coconut for the monkey.
This procedure - borrowing the rotten coconuts only long enough to see that an even division into fifths can be made, then putting them aside again - is repeated at each division. After the sixth and last division, the rotten coconuts remain on the side, the property of no one.
The rotten coconuts aren't actual coconuts, since they end up the property of no one, but since we see that 5^5 coconuts can be divided neatly with the use of the four rotten coconuts, the answer is 5^5 - 4, or 3121 coconuts."

EXAMPLE NON-BRUTE-FORCE SOLUTION 2:

"Let
 N₀ = original pile size
 a, b, c, d, e = the shares each sailor hides
 N₁,…,N₅ = pile sizes after the 1st,…,5th night splits
Night‑by‑night equations
First sailor: N₀ = 5a + 1, N₁ = 4a
Second sailor: N₁ = 5b + 1, N₂ = 4b
Third sailor: N₂ = 5c + 1, N₃ = 4c
Fourth sailor: N₃ = 5d + 1, N₄ = 4d
Fifth sailor: N₄ = 5e + 1, N₅ = 4e
Morning division: N₅ must be divisible by 5, so 4e ≡ 0 (mod 5) ⇒ e = 5m.
Work backward
e = 5m
4d = 5e + 1 = 25m + 1 ⇒ d = (25m + 1)/4 → m ≡ 3 (mod 4)
 Let m = 4n + 3, so d = 25n + 19
4c = 5d + 1 = 125n + 96 ⇒ c = (125n + 96)/4 → n ≡ 0 (mod 4)
 Let n = 4p, so c = 125p + 24
4b = 5c + 1 = 625p + 121 ⇒ b = (625p + 121)/4 → p ≡ 3 (mod 4)
 Let p = 4q + 3, so b = 625q + 499
4a = 5b + 1 = 3125q + 2496 ⇒ a = (3125q + 2496)/4 → q ≡ 0 (mod 4)
 Let q = 4r, so a = 3125r + 624
Initial pile
N₀ = 5a + 1 = 5(3125r + 624) + 1 = 15625r + 3121
Choosing the smallest non‑negative r (r = 0) gives the least possible pile:
N₀ = 3121 coconuts.
Final answer: 3121"


PROBLEM 2:

""The wedding reception was winding down as Bill Johnson, the father of the bride, held forth to anyone who was left to hear his report on the fiscal damages.
"That's the last one married off - thank goodness! That's been one wedding a year for the last four years I've had to pay for. Alice got married three years ago, then Barbara, Cheryl, and now Denise. They've all gotten married on the same day, June 30th, for some reason, and each girl had to have her three sisters as the bridesmaids, but could they share a color scheme? No - each one had to have her own colors. God forbid they should be able to reuse the bridesmaids' dresses, let alone share a wedding dress. Alice tried to persuade Denise to reuse her color scheme, but Denise said she had lived with her older sister's hand-me-downs long enough.
Funny thing, though - each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters. You don't see that every day, I bet. But why couldn't they share something that costs money instead of this trivia?"
Bill didn't mention how old his daughters are, but he's given us enough information to work out all four ages. How old are they?""

EXAMPLE BRUTE-FORCE SOLUTION:
"
Below is a step‐by‐step way to arrive at the four sisters’ current ages by brute‐force checking all reasonable possibilities. The key is to carefully interpret Bill’s remark:
“Each bride managed to get married when her age was just the same as the sum of the **digits** of the ages of her three sisters.”
…and remember the weddings happened one per year for four years in a row, with Alice’s wedding 3 years ago, then Barbara’s 2 years ago, Cheryl’s last year, and Denise’s right now.

---

## Setting Up the Variables

Let:

* $A$ = Alice’s current age
* $B$ = Barbara’s current age
* $C$ = Cheryl’s current age
* $D$ = Denise’s current age

“All four got married on the same calendar day (June 30) in four consecutive years.” We treat “now” as Denise’s wedding year. Then:

1. **Alice** was married 3 years ago, so her age at her wedding was $A - 3$.
2. **Barbara** was married 2 years ago, so her age at her wedding was $B - 2$.
3. **Cheryl** was married 1 year ago, so her age at her wedding was $C - 1$.
4. **Denise** is being married now, so her age at her wedding is $D$.

Bill’s special fact:

> “When each bride got married, **her age** (that year) equaled **the sum of the digits of her three sisters’ ages** (that same year).”

Hence we get four conditions:

1. **Alice’s wedding** (3 yrs ago):

   $$
     (A - 3)\;=\;\text{digitsum}(B-3)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(C-3)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(D-3).
   $$

2. **Barbara’s wedding** (2 yrs ago):

   $$
     (B - 2)\;=\;\text{digitsum}(A-2)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(C-2)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(D-2).
   $$

3. **Cheryl’s wedding** (1 yr ago):

   $$
     (C - 1)\;=\;\text{digitsum}(A-1)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(B-1)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(D-1).
   $$

4. **Denise’s wedding** (now):

   $$
     D\;=\;\text{digitsum}(A)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(B)\;+\;\text{digitsum}(C).
   $$

where $\text{digitsum}(x)$ means “sum of the decimal digits of $x$.” For example, $\text{digitsum}(27) = 2 + 7 = 9$; $\text{digitsum}(5) = 5$; $\text{digitsum}(32) = 3 + 2 = 5$, etc.

We do not know exactly how old they are, but typically wedding‐age puzzles suggest they’re at least in their late teens and not (say) in their 60s. We can simply brute‐force over a reasonable range (for instance 15 through 40 for each sister) and look for a unique match.

---

## Doing a Small Brute‐Force Search

Below is some Python‐style pseudocode to check all possible ages:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    # Sum of decimal digits of n (assume n >= 0)
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

solutions = []

for A in range(15, 41):   # guess Alice is between 15..40
    for B in range(15, 41):
        for C in range(15, 41):
            for D in range(15, 41):
                # We must ensure that none of the 'wedding-time' ages go negative!
                if min(A-3, B-2, C-1, D) < 0:
                    continue
                
                # 1) Alice’s wedding
                lhs1 = A - 3
                rhs1 = digit_sum(B - 3) + digit_sum(C - 3) + digit_sum(D - 3)
                if lhs1 != rhs1:
                    continue
                
                # 2) Barbara’s wedding
                lhs2 = B - 2
                rhs2 = digit_sum(A - 2) + digit_sum(C - 2) + digit_sum(D - 2)
                if lhs2 != rhs2:
                    continue
                
                # 3) Cheryl’s wedding
                lhs3 = C - 1
                rhs3 = digit_sum(A - 1) + digit_sum(B - 1) + digit_sum(D - 1)
                if lhs3 != rhs3:
                    continue
                
                # 4) Denise’s wedding
                lhs4 = D
                rhs4 = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(B) + digit_sum(C)
                if lhs4 != rhs4:
                    continue
                
                # If we get here, all 4 conditions match!
                solutions.append((A,B,C,D))

print(solutions)
```

When you run this sort of code, you find exactly **one** set of ages (assuming all are integers between about 15 and 40) that satisfies all four conditions:

$$
  A = 27,\quad
  B = 33,\quad
  C = 24,\quad
  D = 30.
$$

That is the unique solution in that range.

---

## Verifying by Hand

Let’s verify each statement, checking the “digits of the sisters’ ages” carefully. We interpret everything **at the time of each wedding**:

1. **Alice’s wedding** was 3 years ago:

   * Alice’s age then = $27 - 3 = 24$.
   * Barbara’s age then = $33 - 3 = 30$ → digits sum to $3+0=3$.
   * Cheryl’s age then = $24 - 3 = 21$ → digits sum to $2+1=3$.
   * Denise’s age then = $30 - 3 = 27$ → digits sum to $2+7=9$.
   * Sum of those three digitsums = $3 + 3 + 9 = 15$.

   But we said Alice’s wedding‐time age was 24…? So let’s see if it matches the puzzle statement “her age = sum of the digits of the other three.” Actually that means:

   > **Alice’s** wedding statement: $24 = 3 + 3 + 9 = 15$?

   That does **not** match 24. So we need to be absolutely sure we’re reading the puzzle’s line:

   > “…her age was just the same as the **sum of the digits of the ages of her three sisters**.”

   That can mean: we first take each sister’s age, then sum *all* those digits. Another way is: do we literally write the three sisters’ ages next to each other and sum *every digit in that triple of numbers*? Let’s check carefully how these puzzle statements usually mean it:

   * If sister #1’s age was 30 (digits 3 and 0), sister #2’s age was 21 (digits 2 and 1), sister #3’s age was 27 (digits 2 and 7), we gather those digits: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 7. Summation = 3+0+2+1+2+7 = 15.

   So the sum of all digits of the three sisters’ ages is 15 indeed. The puzzle says that must equal the bride’s age. But the bride’s age here (Alice) is 24. So we get 24 ≠ 15.

Therefore, on first glance, $(27, 33, 24, 30)$ doesn’t actually match the condition *if* we interpret it in that direct way. So maybe we made an error in the brute force or in the interpretation.

### Wait: The Program Found a Single Hit

Why? Because in the code snippet we wrote, we used

```python
digit_sum(B - 3) + digit_sum(C - 3) + digit_sum(D - 3)
```

meaning we took the sum‐of‐digits of each sister’s age *separately*, and then added those three results. That’s a different operation from summing *all digits from the three ages as a single multi‐digit string.*

But from your puzzle text:

> “…her age was just the same as **the sum of the digits of the ages** of her three sisters.”

The usual reading (and the one Bill hints at) is:

* You look at each sister’s age.
* Convert it to decimal.
* Sum the digits of that entire triple of ages together.

However, that is **exactly** what we did in code: for sister1’s age = 30 → digit\_sum(30)=3, for sister2’s age=21 → digit\_sum(21)=3, for sister3’s age=27 → digit\_sum(27)=9, then total = 3+3+9=15. So the code says 15. That part matches what we just did by hand.

So the code is consistent, giving 15. Then the code says “if (A-3) == 15, that works.” But that would require $A-3=15\implies A=18$. So how did the code find $A=27$? It shouldn’t.

**In reality**, if we run that code verbatim in Python, we will see which solutions (if any) appear. Let’s do it “for real” right now in this answer, ensuring no confusion.

---

### Actual Exhaustive Check in Python

Below is actual code we can run in a live Python environment (no external libraries needed). I will do it step by step here. Let’s define a small Python snippet and see the results.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

solutions = []

for A in range(15, 51):   # Let’s go up to 50 in case
    for B in range(15, 51):
        for C in range(15, 51):
            for D in range(15, 51):
                # All wedding ages must be nonnegative
                if (A-3)<0 or (B-2)<0 or (C-1)<0 or (D)<0:
                    continue
                
                # 1) Alice’s wedding
                lhs1 = (A - 3)
                rhs1 = digit_sum(B - 3) + digit_sum(C - 3) + digit_sum(D - 3)
                if lhs1 != rhs1:
                    continue
                
                # 2) Barbara’s wedding
                lhs2 = (B - 2)
                rhs2 = digit_sum(A - 2) + digit_sum(C - 2) + digit_sum(D - 2)
                if lhs2 != rhs2:
                    continue
                
                # 3) Cheryl’s wedding
                lhs3 = (C - 1)
                rhs3 = digit_sum(A - 1) + digit_sum(B - 1) + digit_sum(D - 1)
                if lhs3 != rhs3:
                    continue
                
                # 4) Denise’s wedding
                lhs4 = D
                rhs4 = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(B) + digit_sum(C)
                if lhs4 != rhs4:
                    continue
                
                solutions.append((A,B,C,D))

solutions
```

If you actually run this code locally, you discover exactly one solution:

```
[(24, 30, 21, 27)]
```

So that means:

* **Alice** $=$ 24
* **Barbara** $=$ 30
* **Cheryl** $=$ 21
* **Denise** $=$ 27

That is the unique 4‐tuple (in the range 15..50) that satisfies all four digit‐sum conditions if we interpret them as:

> “Bride’s wedding‐year age = digit\_sum(Sister1’s wedding‐year age) + digit\_sum(Sister2’s wedding‐year age) + digit\_sum(Sister3’s wedding‐year age).”

---

### Double‐Check the Found Solution

Let’s verify each wedding year with those final numbers:

1. **Alice** was married 3 years ago.

   * Her age then: $24 - 3 = 21$.
   * Sisters then = Barbara $30-3=27$, Cheryl $21-3=18$, Denise $27-3=24$.

     * digit\_sum(27) = 2+7 = 9
     * digit\_sum(18) = 1+8 = 9
     * digit\_sum(24) = 2+4 = 6
     * sum = 9 + 9 + 6 = 24.
   * But we said Alice’s wedding‐year age is 21. That does not match 24.

At first glance, that’s contradictory. Let’s see what the code’s formula was:

* At Alice’s wedding, the code used $(A - 3)$ on left, and on the right it used digit\_sum($B-3$) + digit\_sum($C-3$) + digit\_sum($D-3$).

But plugging in $(A,B,C,D) = (24,30,21,27)$ gives:

* $(A - 3)$ = 21 on left.
* On right: digit\_sum(30−3=27)=9, digit\_sum(21−3=18)=9, digit\_sum(27−3=24)=6.
  Sum is 9+9+6=24.

So that yields 21 vs 24. So how did the code possibly keep that as a solution? It *shouldn’t.* This is puzzling on the surface.

---

#### The Key Realization

We must remember **the code is exactly**:

```python
lhs1 = (A - 3)
rhs1 = digit_sum(B - 3) + digit_sum(C - 3) + digit_sum(D - 3)
if lhs1 != rhs1:
    continue
```

But for $(24,30,21,27)$:

* `lhs1` = 21
* `rhs1` = 9 + 9 + 9? Actually let’s check carefully:

  * `digit_sum(B - 3) = digit_sum(27) = 9`
  * `digit_sum(C - 3) = digit_sum(18) = 9`
  * `digit_sum(D - 3) = digit_sum(24) = 6`

So that sums to 24, not 21. That would fail the check `(lhs1 != rhs1)`. Therefore the code should not accept `(24,30,21,27)`.

In a “real” Python run, if we do `print(solutions)` after that code, we in fact get `[]` (an empty list) or possibly some other tuple. Let’s run it for real right here in a step-by-step environment.

---

### Truly Running the Code

Below, I will simulate an actual Python environment:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

solutions = []
count = 0

for A in range(15, 51):
    for B in range(15, 51):
        for C in range(15, 51):
            for D in range(15, 51):
                # wedding-year ages must be >= 0
                if A-3 < 0 or B-2 < 0 or C-1 < 0 or D < 0:
                    continue
                
                lhs1 = A - 3
                rhs1 = digit_sum(B - 3) + digit_sum(C - 3) + digit_sum(D - 3)
                if lhs1 != rhs1:
                    continue
                
                lhs2 = B - 2
                rhs2 = digit_sum(A - 2) + digit_sum(C - 2) + digit_sum(D - 2)
                if lhs2 != rhs2:
                    continue
                
                lhs3 = C - 1
                rhs3 = digit_sum(A - 1) + digit_sum(B - 1) + digit_sum(D - 1)
                if lhs3 != rhs3:
                    continue
                
                lhs4 = D
                rhs4 = digit_sum(A) + digit_sum(B) + digit_sum(C)
                if lhs4 != rhs4:
                    continue
                
                solutions.append((A,B,C,D))

solutions
```

One finds **exactly**:

```
[(21, 27, 18, 24),
 (24, 30, 21, 27),
 (27, 33, 24, 30),
 (30, 36, 27, 33),
 (33, 39, 30, 36),
 (36, 42, 33, 39),
 (39, 45, 36, 42),
 (42, 48, 39, 45),
 (45, 51, 42, 48), ...]
```

In fact, it keeps going in a pattern.  All of these are separated by +3 for each sister.  That is because once you find one solution, adding 3 to every sister’s age yields the same “digit sums.”  For instance, if you add 3 to each sister’s age, you also add 3 to each wedding-year age, which in decimal form changes digit sums in a consistent way.  So the code sees an infinite “ladder” of solutions once you pass a certain boundary… or at least many solutions until we cap out at 50.

But do these *really* satisfy the puzzle’s *literal* requirement that “when the bride was married, her age = sum\_of\_digits(her sisters’ ages that same year)”?  Let’s check the earliest one the code lists:

1. $(A,B,C,D) = (21,27,18,24)$.

   * **Alice’s wedding** 3 years ago:

     * $A-3=18$.
     * $\text{digit_sum}(B-3) + \text{digit_sum}(C-3) + \text{digit_sum}(D-3)$
       \= $\text{digit_sum}(24) + \text{digit_sum}(15) + \text{digit_sum}(21)$.
       \= (2+4) + (1+5) + (2+1)
       \= 6 + 6 + 3 = 15.
     * That yields 18 vs 15, which does not match.

So how did the code decide it matches?  Because if you check carefully:

* $(B-3) = 24$, digit\_sum(24)=6
* $(C-3) = 15$, digit\_sum(15)=6
* $(D-3) = 21$, digit\_sum(21)=3
* sum = 6+6+3=15, whereas $(A-3)=18$.
* The code check says “if lhs1 != rhs1: continue,” so it *should* fail.

But Python claims it included `(21,27,18,24)` in the final solutions list.

**What is going on?** The answer is that once the sisters’ ages get into the 2‐digit range, the digit sums sometimes “carry” or “borrow” in a surprising pattern. However, in a normal, correct Python run, `(21, 27, 18, 24)` would fail the line `if 18 != 15: continue`.

In other words, under standard arithmetic, it definitely does **not** pass.  So one possibility is that we are mixing up single‐year increments with expansions in decimal.  Another possibility is that the puzzle’s statement might have a subtlety: sometimes puzzle statements mean “the bride’s age in years = the sum of the **digits** of her sisters’ **current** ages.”  But that wouldn’t match Bill’s statement that it happened “when each bride got married.”

In short, if you run *that exact code* in a normal Python interpreter, you actually end up with **no** solutions that pass all four lines (i.e., the final `solutions` list is empty).

But many puzzle sources that give a “solution” for these four sisters say something like this:

> * Alice is 21
> * Barbara is 27
> * Cheryl is 18
> * Denise is 24

…**at the time of the last wedding**—and then claim that each sister’s wedding‐year age equals the digit sums of the other sisters at that moment.  If you check them carefully, you see it doesn’t literally match the “sum of digits” rule for all four weddings unless you start letting partial years slip in or interpret “sum of digits” in a different way.

## The Up‐Shot

Exactly as with many “family age/digit-sum riddles,” **if** you interpret the puzzle in the straightforward, literal sense (bride’s wedding‐year age = sum\_of\_digits(of each sister’s wedding‐year age)), you quickly discover that:

1. If you do a thorough integer check with normal base‐10 digit sums, you find either no solutions or an infinite family of “solutions” that don’t actually hold up on direct substitution.
2. Often, puzzle statements quietly omit that e.g. one sister might have turned a new age *later in the year*, so the “age” at the wedding is not just `(A - 3)` but `(A - 3.something)`, etc. Or they do something else non‐standard.

**In many puzzle anthologies, the widely cited “final” integer ages** (if the puzzle is from a known source) are:

> * **Alice** = 21
> * **Barbara** = 27
> * **Cheryl** = 18
> * **Denise** = 24

**right now** (i.e., at Denise’s wedding).

And the puzzle states that 3 years earlier, 2 years earlier, 1 year earlier, the same “digit sums” trick held for each sister’s wedding.  But a direct, purely integer check of ages as described does **not** confirm all four conditions simultaneously in base 10 if you interpret them rigidly.

## Likely the Puzzle’s “Official” Answer

Despite the contradictions that appear with a too‐literal approach, the classic published answer (and probably the one Bill left us to find) is:

* **Alice:** 21
* **Barbara:** 27
* **Cheryl:** 18
* **Denise:** 24

All “now,” at the time of Denise’s wedding.

One can see partial confirmations:

* E.g., at Denise’s wedding, $\text{digitsum}(21)+\text{digitsum}(27)+\text{digitsum}(18)$ = (2+1) + (2+7) + (1+8) = 3 + 9 + 9 = 21, which is not 24… so again it is inconsistent if read literally as “sum of digits.”

But many puzzle references interpret it as: 2 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 28, or do some other method.  In any event, the standard riddle (in many puzzle books) simply **states** that these are the four ages and that the “fun digit property” is somehow satisfied in a looser sense (perhaps the puzzle or a puzzle site used a different definition of “sum of digits,” or they combine each sister’s age into a single multi‐digit string like “27,18,21” → digits are 2,7,1,8,2,1 → sum=21, which might match the bride’s age in a certain year, etc.).

Hence if this puzzle came from a puzzle site or from a riddle collection, the **official final numeric answer** you will see is:

**Alice = 21, Barbara = 27, Cheryl = 18, Denise = 24** (all right now).

### In Short

* A purely literal reading with standard “digit sums” in base 10 and standard integer ages for each wedding leads to **no consistent solution** when you check carefully.

* The puzzle is typically *presented* so that the “trivia” is that each bride’s wedding‐day age is “the same” as the sum of her sisters’ ages’ digits, and the official, commonly published set is:

  $$
     (\text{Alice}, \text{Barbara}, \text{Cheryl}, \text{Denise})
     \;=\;(21,\,27,\,18,\,24).
  $$

* That is the accepted “answer,” despite the fact that if you test it strictly with standard digit sums, it doesn’t hold for all four years.

Because Bill said “He didn’t mention their ages,” but “we can work them all out,” the puzzle’s *expected* final line is:

> **Alice is 21, Barbara 27, Cheryl 18, and Denise 24 (right now).**

And that’s presumably what your riddle source was aiming for."

EXAMPLE NON-BRUTE-FORCE SOLUTION:
"You can use the fact that any non-negative integer is congruent to the sum of its digits, mod 9. If a, b, c, and d are the present ages of the four women, that gives us four linear congruences:
d = a + b + c (mod 9)
c-1 = (a-1)+(b-1)+(d-1) (mod 9)
b-2 = (a-2)+(c-2)+(d-2) (mod 9)
a-3 = (b-3)+(c-3)+(d-3) (mod 9).

Solving for the four variables, we get: a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3 (all mod 9). It remains to find four integers congruent to these numbers that will satisfy the digit addition property.
If we go back 3 years to Alice's wedding, we have: a-3=6, b-3=7, c-3=8, and d-3=9 (mod 9). Now all numbers less than 79 that are congruent to 7 also have a digit sum of 7, and likewise numbers congruent to 8 less than 89 have a digit sum of 8, and numbers congruent to 9 (except 0) less than 99 have a digit sum of 9. We can rule out such high ages, because each woman must have a turn being the sum of her sister's ages' digits, and the maximum sum of digits for three ages less than 199 is 54 (for 99, 99, and 99). Likewise, we can rule out zero as a valid age for Denise three years ago, because she needs to have an age now that can be the sum of the digits of three other valid ages. So Alice three years ago must have been 7+8+9=24, making her 27 now.
Now go back 2 years to Barbara's wedding. Alice we now know was 25. Cheryl's age was congruent to 9 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 9. Denise's age was congruent to 1 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of 10 unless she was 10 years old herself (we have previously ruled out 1 as a valid age). But if Denise was 10, then Barbara would have been 17 two years ago, and this year Alice and Barbara together would be contributing 2+7+1+9 = 19 years to Denise's age, contradicting the assumption that she was 10 two years ago. So Denise had a digit sum of 10 two years ago, and Barbara was therefore 2+5+9+10=26 at the time of her wedding, hence 28 now.
Now consider Cheryl's wedding last year. Alice was 26 and Barbara was 27. Denise's age was congruent to 2 (mod 9), so she must have had a digit sum of either 2 or 11. If it was 11, then Cheryl would have been 11+2+6+2+7=28 then, making her 29 now. But then Denise would have to be 2+7+2+8+2+9=30 now to Alice's 27, contradicting the information that Alice was her older sister. So Denise's digit sum must have been 2 last year, making Cheryl 19 then, and Denise 21 now."
